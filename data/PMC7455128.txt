0	breast cancer	CSMD1	NA	ABSTRACT	A germline variation within the CSMD1 gene predicts aromatase inhibitor response in breast cancer
0	breast cancer	ER	NA	INTRO	About 70% of primary breast cancers express estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha).
0	cancers	NA	NA	INTRO	Adjuvant endocrine therapy, including aromatase inhibitors (AIs), is a standard treatment for these patients, regardless of tumor size or nodal status.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	For postmenopausal women with primary ER+ breast cancer, AIs are the standard-of-care to prevent relapse and prolong survival.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In advanced disease, AI-based therapy is a standard initial treatment.
0	cancers	NA	NA	INTRO	Despite their efficacy, about 19% of patients with early-stage disease suffer a recurrence by 10 years, and resistance to AIs in advanced or metastatic tumors invariably occurs.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Therefore, there is a great need to understand the underlying mechanisms associated with AI response and resistance
0	cancers	NA	NA	INTRO	There are well-accepted biomarkers associated with both de novo and acquired resistance to endocrine therapy, and both host (germline) and somatic (tumor) alterations are known to contribute to resistance.
0	cancers	ER	NA	INTRO	For example, the tumor genome has revealed several mechanisms of acquired AI resistance such as amplifications or mutations that can activate ESR1 and ligand-independent ERalpha activation of downstream pathways such as the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase.
0	breast cancer	ARo	NA	INTRO	At the same time, germline single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CYP19A1 have been associated with variation in circulating estrogen concentrations and with breast cancer risk
0	NA	ARo	NA	INTRO	In postmenopausal women, estrogen is mainly synthesized in peripheral tissues through the action of aromatase (CYP19A1).
0	NA	ARo	NA	INTRO	The main substrates, testosterone and androstenedione, are transformed by aromatase into 17beta-estradiol (E2) and estrone (E1), respectively.
0	NA	ARo	NA	INTRO	AIs potently inhibit aromatase and decrease estrogen levels.
0	NA	ARo	NA	INTRO	Two classes of AIs are currently in clinical use: steroidal : e.g., exemestane, which binds aromatase irreversibly : and nonsteroidal : e.g., anastrozole and letrozole, which block the enzyme reversibly.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	While high BMI has been associated with AI resistance relative to tamoxifen : suggesting that variability in estrogen suppression might be associated with clinical outcome : and there are no biomarkers unique to an individual AI, large phase III adjuvant clinical trials do not indicate any difference in efficacy between the 3 AIs
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In the present work, following our previous observation that suppression of estrogens is associated with anastrozole treatment outcomes, we performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using changes in estrogen levels (before and after anastrozole) as the phenotype of interest using patients prospectively enrolled in the Mayo/M.D.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Anderson/Memorial Sloan Kettering (designated M3) pharmacogenomics study.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Here, we identified a series of SNPs that met genome-wide significance.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	To further determine whether these SNPs in genes associated with estrogen suppression were also associated with long-term clinical outcome, we identified all SNPs within these gene regions based on the 1000 Genome Project and then examined their associations with breast cancer outcomes using GWAS data previously obtained from the Canadian Cancer Trials Group MA.27 trial.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	MA.27 was a phase III trial comparing adjuvant anastrozole and exemestane treatment of postmenopausal women with ER+ breast cancer.
0	NA	CSMD1	NA	INTRO	The GWAS from the M3 clinical study identified SNPs within the human CUB and Sushi multiple domains 1 (CSMD1) gene associated with changes in estrogen levels during anastrozole therapy.

0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The variant SNP genotype was associated with longer BCFI.
0	NA	ARo	NA	INTRO	Functional studies indicated that the SNP altered the CYP19A1 expression in an anastrozole-dependent fashion through transcription regulation.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	These findings further confirmed our previous observation that anastrozole is different from exemestane and letrozole.
0	NA	ER	NA	INTRO	Our previous study has already shown that anastrozole, but not letrozole or exemestane, acts as an ERalpha ligand and degrader, and in the current study, we further show that the addition of E2 could sensitize cells to anastrozole, even in anastrozole- or fulvestrant-resistant models
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	RESULTS	To identify SNPs associated with AI estrogen suppression, we performed GWAS for changes in estrogen levels before and after anastrozole in 624 postmenopausal women with resected early-stage ER+ breast cancer accrued through the M3 study.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The flow diagram (Supplemental Figure 1A; supplemental material available online with this article; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.137571DS1) shows the number of patients included in the analysis.
0	NA	E1	NA	RESULTS	We performed 3 GWA studies for changes in E1, E2, and the sum of E1 and E2 (Figure 1A and Supplemental Figure 1B).
1	NA	DLG2	rs2449598	RESULTS	Common SNPs reaching genome wide significance (P < 5 x 10-8) among the 3 GWAS included rs2449598 within DLG2 on chromosome 11 (P = 2.23 x 10-10 to 1.24 x 10-8), rs1437153 near CDH11 on chromosome 16 (P = 2.82 x 10-9 to 2.7 x 10-8), and rs6981827 in the intron of the CSMD1 gene on chromosome 8 (P = 2.02 x 10-8 to 2.12 x 10-8) (Figure 1A; Supplemental Figure 1B; Supplemental Table 1).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The variant alleles for these SNPs were associated with less estrogen suppression during AI treatment
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Because M3 was a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study, outcome data were not available, and we examined the SNPs identified in M3 in the MA.27 trial where we had long-term follow-up.
1	NA	DLG2	NA	RESULTS	We identified all SNPs in DLG2, CDH11, and CSMD1 gene regions (100 kb up- and downstream of the gene) using data from the 1000 Genome Project and determined their association with BCFI in MA.27 for which GWAS results were available.
0	NA	CSMD1	rs6990851	RESULTS	The most significant association with the MA.27 BCFI phenotype was the rs6990851 SNP in the CSMD1 gene (P = 4.83 x 10-6, HR = 0.56) (Figure 1B).
0	NA	NA	rs6990851	RESULTS	The variant allele (minor allele frequency [MAF] = 0.21) for rs6990851 was associated with longer BCFI (Figure 1C).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	No difference was observed between the 2 drugs with regard to SNP effect on BCFI.
0	breast cancer	NA	rs6990851	RESULTS	The rs6990851 SNP from MA.27 and the rs6981827 from M3 were only weakly linked in the M3 breast cancer patients (r2 = 0.014) and the MA.27 population (r2 = 0.02).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Therefore, neither of the SNPs was significantly associated with the other phenotype.
0	NA	CSMD1	rs6981827	RESULTS	The CSMD1 variant SNP, rs6981827 (MAF = 0.05), associated with less estrogen change in the M3 study (effect size = -0.60), was not an expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) SNP for CSMD1 gene expression based on genotype-tissue expression (GTEx), while the CSMD1 SNP rs6990851, which was associated with longer BCFI, was associated with higher CSMD1 expression level in adipose and brain tissues, and with a trend in breast tissue (Supplemental Figure 1C)
0	NA	CSMD1	NA	RESULTS	We first determined whether the expression of CSMD1 might be estrogen dependent.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We treated ER-expressing ZR-75-1 and T47D cells with 0.1 nM E2 and observed that CSMD1 mRNA was significantly induced (P < 0.01; Supplemental Figure 2).
0	NA	ARo	NA	RESULTS	Because the known mechanism of action of AIs is to block aromatase activity, we then tested a possible relationship between the expression of CSMD1 and CYP19A1.
0	breast cancer	CSMD1	NA	RESULTS	Overexpression of CSMD1 increased CYP19A1 expression levels in breast cancer cells and human adipocytes (Figure 2A).
0	NA	CSMD1	rs6990851	RESULTS	We then used ENCODE data to search for putative estrogen response elements (EREs) and identified 2 EREs within 500 bp of the CSMD1 SNP, rs6990851.
0	NA	CSMD1	rs6990851	RESULTS	Rs6990851 mapped to intron 1 of CSMD1, and 2 EREs were detected at 291 bp upstream and 296 bp downstream, respectively, while rs6981827 did not have any EREs within 500 bp, in addition to its lack of eQTL relationship with CSMD1.
0	NA	NA	rs6990851	RESULTS	Therefore, we focused on rs6990851 for further functional studies.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Based on our prior experience of studying SNP effects on gene expression and hormonal therapy, we took advantage of cell lines selected on the basis of CSMD1genotype from a genomic data-rich panel of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) that has already proven to be a powerful tool for generating and testing pharmacogenomic hypotheses.
0	NA	CSMD1	rs6990851	RESULTS	We first exposed LCLs selected based on the rs6990851 SNP genotype of hormones or AIs to determine the effect of the SNP on CSMD1 and CYP19A1 expression.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	This is a strategy that we commonly used to determine the functional impact of GWAS signals.
0	NA	CSMD1	rs6990851	RESULTS	LCLs with homozygous WT or variant genotypes for the CSMD1 rs6990851 SNP were treated with increasing concentrations of androstenedione, a precursor of estrogen, and CSMD1 and CYP19A1 mRNA levels were determined.
0	NA	CSMD1	NA	RESULTS	Cells with homozygous WT SNP genotype showed increased expression of CSMD1 and, in parallel, CYP19A1 expression (Figure 2, B-D).
0	NA	CSMD1	NA	RESULTS	In contrast, in LCLs with the variant allele, CSMD1 and CYP19A1 expression was virtually unchanged with androstenedione.
0	NA	CSMD1	NA	RESULTS	Importantly, addition of anastrozole reversed the expression patterns of CSMD1 and CYP19A1 (Figure 2B).
0	NA	CSMD1	NA	RESULTS	Specifically, addition of anastrozole increased CSMD1 and CYP19A1 expression in cells with the variant SNP genotype but decreased CSMD1 and CYP19A1 levels to or below baseline in cells with the WT allele (Figure 2, B and E).
0	NA	CSMD1	NA	RESULTS	Interestingly, neither letrozole nor exemestane (Figure 2, C and D) significantly changed the expression patterns of CSMD1 and CYP19A1 compared between WT and variant LCLs
0	NA	ER	rs6990851	RESULTS	To determine whether the SNP impact on gene expression reflects differential binding of ERalpha to EREs that are located in close proximity of rs6990851, we performed ChIP assays using an ERalpha antibody.
0	NA	ER	rs6990851	RESULTS	We found that the rs6990851 SNP effect occurred through the ERE located 296 bp upstream from the SNP (Figure 2F) and resulted in an increased binding of ERalpha in WT cells treated with androstenedione.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	A similar result was observed in variant cells when anastrozole was added (Figure 2G, left panel).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	However, no differential binding to the second ERE located 291 bp downstream from the SNP was detected (Supplemental Figure 3).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Furthermore, we did not observe any SNP-dependent binding with letrozole or exemestane (Figure 2G, right panel)
0	NA	CSMD1	NA	RESULTS	We next sought to determine the functional consequences of the CSMD1 SNP on response to AIs.
0	NA	CSMD1	NA	RESULTS	LCLs homozygous for the variant SNP, which resulted in high CSMD1 expression, were more sensitive to anastrozole than homozygous WT or heterozygous LCLs (Figure 3A, left panel), whereas these different alleles had little effect on letrozole or exemestane sensitivity (Figure 3A, middle and right panels).
0	breast cancer	CSMD1	NA	RESULTS	To assess the role of CSMD1 in AI response in breast cancer cells, we used the MCF7/AC1 cell line because of its high expression of the AI target CYP19A1.
0	NA	CSMD1	NA	RESULTS	Additionally, letrozole resistant (LetR), a letrozole-resistant cell line, was used to determine the role of CSMD1 in AI response in an AI-resistant setting.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Finally, we also used human adipocytes because adipose tissue is the predominant source of estrogens in postmenopause women.
0	NA	CSMD1	NA	RESULTS	In all 3 lines, overexpression of CSMD1 significantly increased anastrozole sensitivity compared with empty vector, whereas overexpression of CSMD1 showed little effect on letrozole and exemestane sensitivity (Figure 3B).
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	RESULTS	These findings were also observed in 2 other ER+ breast cancer cell lines (T47D and ZR-75-1) (Supplemental Figure 4).
0	NA	CSMD1	NA	RESULTS	To further define the relationship between CSMD1 and CYP19A1, we attempted to reverse the AI sensitization effect resulting from CSMD1 overexpression by knocking out endogenous CYP19A1 using CRISPR/Cas9 methodology in T47D cells (Figure 3C).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	As shown in Figure 3D, CYP19-KO abrogated the effect of CSMD1 overexpression on survival, indicating that CYP19 is a major target that mediates the effect of CSMD1 on anastrozole response.
0	melanoma	CSMD1	NA	RESULTS	CSMD1 was recently shown to interact with SMAD3 in melanoma cells.
0	NA	SMAD3	NA	RESULTS	SMAD3, activated by TGF-beta3, was required for steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) binding to the CYP19A1 type II promoter.
0	NA	CSMD1	NA	RESULTS	We therefore investigated whether CSMD1 might be a component of the SMAD3-TGF-beta3 receptor (TGF-betaR) complex involved in CYP19A1 transcription regulation.
0	breast cancer	CSMD1	NA	RESULTS	CSMD1 coprecipitated SMAD3 in breast cancer cells and human adipocytes, and a reciprocal immunoprecipitation further confirmed the interaction (Figure 3E).
0	NA	CSMD1	NA	RESULTS	Overexpression of CSMD1 enhanced the interaction between SMAD3 and TGF-betaR and resulted in SMAD3 activation, as evidenced by increased pSMAD3 (Figure 3F).
0	NA	CSMD1	NA	RESULTS	This regulation of CSMD1 on CYP19A1 was impaired after the knockdown of SF-1 or SMAD3 (Supplemental Figure 5).
0	NA	CSMD1	NA	RESULTS	These results suggest that CSMD1 is a scaffolding protein that brings SMAD3 and TGF-betaR together and promotes phosphorylation of SMAD3.
0	NA	CSMD1	NA	RESULTS	To further confirm that the regulation of the CSMD1 SNP on AI response is through the CSMD1/SMAD3/CYP19A1 axis, we treated LCLs carrying either WT or variant SNP genotypes with androstenedione alone or in combination with an individual AI.
0	NA	ARo	rs6990851	RESULTS	As shown in Figure 3G, cells with different rs6990851 SNP genotypes showed striking differences in pSMAD3 and CYP19A1 levels.
0	NA	ARo	NA	RESULTS	In particular, WT cells had increased pSMAD3 and CYP19A1 levels after androstenedione treatment, and significantly reduced pSMAD3 and CYP19A1 levels when anastrozole was added.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Importantly, addition of letrozole or exemestane did not alter the protein levels in WT cells.
0	NA	ARo	NA	RESULTS	In contrast, in the variant cells, androstenedione treatment did not change pSMAD3 and CYP19A1 levels compared with vehicle treatment, while addition of anastrozole, but not letrozole or exemestane, significantly upregulated pSMAD3 and CYP19A1 levels.
0	NA	CSMD1	rs6990851	RESULTS	Therefore, rs6990851 upregulated CSMD1 expression in the presence of anastrozole, but not the other 2 AIs (Figure 2), resulting in SMAD3 activation and increased CYP19A1 gene expression (Figure 3G), leading to increased sensitivity to anastrozole (Figure 3A)
0	NA	CSMD1	NA	RESULTS	The observation of the CSMD1 SNP and AI-dependent regulation of gene expression and differential response to individual AI further confirmed our previous finding.
0	NA	ER	NA	RESULTS	Our previous studies indicated that anastrozole is different from the other 2 AIs by possessing a second mechanism of action, being an ERalpha agonist in a similar fashion to E2.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	It can activate ERalpha-dependent transcription, but the effect decreased with increasing concentrations of anastrozole due to induction of ERalpha degradation.
0	NA	ER	NA	RESULTS	To further explore the impact of anastrozole effect on ERalpha activation and degradation, we tested various concentrations of E2 and anastrozole, as well the 2 combined.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We showed that anastrozole plus E2 at 0.1 or 1 nM showed approximately 2.4- and 3.01-fold increases, respectively, in luciferase activity compared with anastrozole or E2 alone at that concentration in CYP19-KO T47D cells (Figure 4A, P < 0.001).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	However, when E2 concentration increased to 10 nM, combination with anastrozole led to a significant inhibition in luciferase activity compared with anastrozole or E2 alone (Figure 4A, P < 0.001).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Letrozole and exemestane had no impact on E2-induced luciferase activity (Figure 4A).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	These observations suggest that anastrozole has a cumulative effect with low-dose E2 to activate ERalpha-mediated transcriptional activation.
0	NA	ER	NA	RESULTS	However, at higher concentration of E2, it showed a cumulative effect with anastrozole on ERalpha degradation, leading to reduced ERE-dependent transcription activity.
0	NA	ER	NA	RESULTS	We further tested the combination effect on ERalpha protein level.
0	NA	ER	NA	RESULTS	Anastrozole (10 nM) combined with E2 at 10 or 100 nM decreased ERalpha protein level, while E2 or anastrozole at 10 nM alone was not able to degrade ERalpha (Figure 4B).
0	NA	ER	NA	RESULTS	Consistent with previous findings showing that high concentrations of E2 led to a proteasome-mediated degradation of ERalpha protein, we found that the proteasome inhibitor MG132, but not the autophagy inhibitor 3MA, could inhibit the protein degradation induced by anastrozole (Figure 4C)
0	breast cancer	ER	NA	RESULTS	Since anastrozole can function as an ERalpha ligand, to investigate whether anastrozole regulates similar or different sets of genes compared with E2, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) using T47D breast cancer cells treated with anastrozole (10 nM) alone, E2 (0.1 nM) alone or anastrozole (10 nM) plus E2 (0.1 nM).
0	NA	ER	NA	RESULTS	These concentrations were chosen based on the ability of anastrozole to increase luciferase activity without degrading ERalpha.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Anastrozole alone significantly altered levels of 476 transcripts compared with the vehicle control (FDR < 0.05), among which, 398 genes overlapped with E2 single treatment.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	As shown in the Venn diagram, anastrozole plus E2 treatment resulted in altered expression of 513 transcripts, 204 of which were common with anastrozole alone, and 384 of the 513 were common with E2-alone treatment (Figure 4D, Supplemental Table 2, and Supplemental Figure 6A).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Selected genes identified by RNA-seq were further validated by quantitative PCR (qPCR) following anastrozole, E2, or anastrozole plus E2 treatment (Supplemental Figure 6B).
0	NA	VEGFA	NA	RESULTS	Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) for anastrozole treatment showed that, compared with E2, anastrozole regulated genes involved in steroid biosynthesis, DNA replication, toxoplasmosis, VEGF signaling pathway, and actin cytoskeleton (Supplemental Table 3).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Collectively, these findings suggest that, although at large, anastrozole behaves very similar to E2 with regard to its effect on downstream gene regulation (384 genes), it also preferentially regulates pathways (204 genes) that are different from E2
0	toxicity	ER	NA	RESULTS	To test whether the combined effects of anastrozole and E2 on ERalpha protein degradation might lead to augmented antitumor activity compared with anastrozole alone, we evaluated cytotoxicity in CYP19-KO, letrozole-resistant AC1-LetR, and anastrozole-resistant MCF7/anastrozole resistant (AnaR) cells with anastrozole with or without E2 treatment.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	As shown in Figure 5, A-C, 10 and 100 nM of E2 sensitized these cells to anastrozole, but not letrozole or exemestane, and anastrozole plus 10 nM E2 showed better therapeutic effect than any of the 3 AI alone in anastrozole-resistant cells (Supplemental Figure 6C).
0	NA	ER	NA	RESULTS	Treatment with 10 or 100 nM E2 plus 100 nM anastrozole also increased the degradation of ERalpha protein compared with cells exposed to 100 nM anastrozole alone (Figure 5D).
0	NA	ER	NA	RESULTS	It is important to emphasize that E2 alone, at the concentrations of 10 or 100 nM, did not induce ERalpha degradation (Figure 5D) : neither did it exert cytotoxic effect (Supplemental Figure 6D).
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	RESULTS	To further confirm the combination effect, we used organoids grown from 2 primary ER+ breast cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and treated with anastrozole plus E2.
0	cancers	ER	NA	RESULTS	In all 3 organoids derived from 2 unique breast cancer patients, we confirmed ERalpha positivity (Figure 5D, Western blot).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The dose response after 72-hour exposure to AI alone or in combination with 100 nM E2 was obtained.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The number of survival organoids was significantly reduced 72 hours after exposure to anastrozole plus E2, but not to letrozole or exemestane plus E2 (Figure 6A).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	To further assess the drug combination effects over time (9 days), we used a luminescence survival assay.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Here, we selected a 200 nM anastrozole concentration based on the previous organoid response curves (Figure 6A).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	As shown in Figure 6B, anastrozole and E2 significantly inhibited organoid growth compared with anastrozole alone (P < 0.01)
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	RESULTS	Compared with the third-generation AIs, fulvestrant has superior efficacy and is a preferred treatment option for patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MBC) based on the FALCON trial and in the neoadjuvant setting based on the CARMINA 02 trial.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	RESULTS	However, up to half of ER+ MBC patients show intrinsic resistance, and ultimately all of them develop acquired resistance to fulvestrant.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	To test the efficacy of anastrozole plus E2 in the fulvestrant-resistant setting, we treated fulvestrant-resistant MCF7/164R-7 cells with individual AI alone or combined with increasing concentrations of E2.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We found that, in fulvestrant-resistant cells, individual AI alone had a slightly better cytotoxic effect than fulvestrant.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	However, only anastrozole showed an E2 dose-dependent sensitization, and this phenomenon was not observed for letrozole or exemestane (Figure 7A and Supplemental Figure 6E).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Since fulvestrant is used in the AI-resistant setting, we then compared the response of anastrozole plus E2 to fulvestrant in MCF7/AnaR-2 cells.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Our data reveal that the combination of anastrozole with 100 nM E2 showed an effect similar to that of fulvestrant (Figure 7B, top panel).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	MCF7/AnaR-2 cell growth was dramatically reduced in the presence of 100 nM anastrozole plus E2 after 3 days (Figure 7B, bottom panel).
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	RESULTS	Even in endocrine-naive breast cancer cells (MCF7AC1, ZR-75-1, and T47D), anastrozole plus E2 improved the therapeutic effects compared with anastrozole or fulvestrant alone (Figure 7B, top and panels).
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	RESULTS	Finally, anastrozole plus E2 improved the therapeutic response in breast cancer PDX organoids compared with fulvestrant (Figure 7C).

0	NA	CSMD1	NA	DISCUSS	For our GWAS, we used 2 independent studies with 2 different but related AI response phenotypes, estrogen suppression and BCFI, and we identified 2 SNPs in the CSMD1 gene that were associated with 1 of these 2 phenotypes (Figure 1, B and C).
0	NA	CSMD1	rs6990851	DISCUSS	However, only rs6990851, and not rs6981827, was eQTL for CSMD1.

0	NA	CSMD1	rs6990851	DISCUSS	Here, we show that CSMD1 regulation is estrogen dependent and only the rs6990851 is SNP dependent, while rs6981827 is not.
0	NA	NA	rs6990851	DISCUSS	The rs6990851 SNP is in a region that has EREs within 500 bp of the SNP.
0	NA	ER	rs6990851	DISCUSS	We demonstrated that the rs6990851 SNP modifies ERalpha binding to an ERE in the CSMD1 gene, leading to altered CSMD1 and CYP19 expression in an anastrozole-dependent fashion (Figure 2G).
0	NA	CSMD1	NA	DISCUSS	Mechanistically, CSMD1 regulated CYP19A1 gene transcription by acting as a scaffolding protein for SMAD3 and TGF-betaR (Figure 3, E and G, and Supplemental Figure 5).
0	NA	CSMD1	rs6990851	DISCUSS	The variant rs6990851 SNP allele that increased CSMD1 expression also increased sensitivity to anastrozole, but not letrozole or exemestane (Figure 3).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This result strongly suggested potential differences in mechanisms of action between anastrozole and the other 2 AIs, and this was also confirmed in our previous finding.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We did not observe an SNP-drug interaction in the MA.27 trial, and the SNP showed a protective effect regardless of the treatment arm, exemestane versus anastrozole.
0	NA	CSMD1	rs6990851	DISCUSS	Based on the SNP-dependent drug effects on CSMD1 and CYP19 in LCLs, we concluded that the variant rs6990851 SNP results in lower expression of CSMD1 and, in turn, CYP19 in the presence of androstenedione, leading to slow cell proliferation and better prognosis.
0	NA	CSMD1	NA	DISCUSS	The addition of exemestane or letrozole did not change the CSMD1 and CYP19 expression patterns compared with androstenedione treatment (Figure 2, C and D), suggesting that the protective effect of the SNP in the exemestane-treated arm might be mainly due to slow proliferation caused by low CYP19 expression in subjects carrying the variant SNP.
0	NA	CSMD1	NA	DISCUSS	However, treatment with anastrozole in subjects carrying the variant SNP genotype upregulated CSMD1 and CYP19, resulting in increased drug target for AIs.
0	NA	CSMD1	rs6990851	DISCUSS	Therefore, we observed a more sensitive phenotype of anastrozole in LCLs containing the variant CSMD1 rs6990851 SNP (Figure 3A).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Therefore, the SNP was a protective SNP with outcomes in MA.27, regardless of the treatment arm.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, based on our results, the mechanisms underlying these association may be different between anastrozole and the other AIs
0	NA	B-G	NA	DISCUSS	The identification of anastrozole and SNP genotype-dependent regulation of gene expression (Figure 2, B-G, and Figure 3) could be explained by a potentially novel mechanism of anastrozole action: anastrozole binds to ERalpha resulting in ERalpha degradation.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	At the transcriptional level, anastrozole-dependent transcripts significantly overlapped with E2, but also displayed marked differences from E2, indicating a unique function for anastrozole-ERalpha gene transcription regulation (Figure 4D).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The differences between anastrozole and E2-driven transcriptional programs may be due to differential expression of coregulators that dictate specific ERalpha-DNA binding and transcriptional activity.
0	NA	ER	NA	DISCUSS	Like tamoxifen, it is also possible that anastrozole might exert different functions through ERalpha, either as an agonist or antagonist in a tissue context-dependent manner, a process that is also dependent on the receptor-DNA complex interacting with different coregulators.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Additional work to decipher these hypotheses is ongoing
0	NA	ER	NA	DISCUSS	Finally, the effect of anastrozole on ERalpha protein degradation is potentiated by E2 (Figure 4B).
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In a short-term randomized study, anastrozole treatment significantly reduced mean ER expression from baseline in breast cancer patients.
0	NA	ER	NA	DISCUSS	The downregulation of cellular ERalpha protein occurred without a reduction in ESR1 mRNA, consistent with our findings.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Taking advantage of this mechanism, we tested the combination of anastrozole plus E2 as a potential therapeutic strategy, especially in AI- or fulvestrant-resistant breast cancer.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We showed that anastrozole plus E2 inhibits proliferation of AI- and fulvestrant-resistant breast cancer cells in addition to its effect in hormone therapy-naive breast cancer cells (Figure 5 and Figure 7).
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Furthermore, the same results were also observed in breast cancer PDX-derived organoids (Figure 6, A and B).
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Hence, the combination might offer a potential alternative therapeutic strategy against refractory ER+ breast cancer.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	E2 is being used in the clinic to treat breast cancer with doses as high as 30 mg/d.
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The E2 effect on tumor inhibition has also been observed in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer in mice, where estrogen can reverse tamoxifen resistance.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Therefore, the combination of anastrozole plus E2 might be a feasible therapeutic option that could be tested in the future.
0	NA	ER	NA	DISCUSS	In our study, we also showed that the combination of anastrozole and E2 was superior to E2 alone (Supplemental Figure 6E), further suggesting that E2 potentiates the effect of anastrozole on ERalpha degradation.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The development of CDK4/6 inhibitors has changed the therapeutic management of HR+ MBC.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib are approved in combination with an AI or fulvestrant for HR+ MBC.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Abemaciclib is also approved as a monotherapy for pretreated patients.
0	breast cancer	CDK4	NA	DISCUSS	Key questions in the field include whether all patients with HR+ MBC should receive a CDK4/6 inhibitor up front and what the mechanism may be of clinical resistance.
0	NA	CDK4	NA	DISCUSS	Patients who progressed on CDK4/6 inhibitor plus AI are currently offered additional therapies such as fulvestrant as a single agent, but the PFS with fulvestrant in the post-CDK4/6 setting is unclear.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Therefore, there is a great need to identify additional therapies to improve outcome.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our observations here, combination of anastrozole and E2, may offer additional therapeutic strategies to further improve outcomes of HR+ MBC
0	NA	CSMD1	NA	DISCUSS	Taking advantage of the results of 2 GWAS with related but different phenotypes associated with AI action, we have identified a CSMD1 SNP as a predicative marker for AI response.
0	NA	ER	NA	DISCUSS	Furthermore, the cumulative effect of anastrozole plus E2 on ERalpha degradation might provide an alternative therapy for ER-positive patients, especially those who are already resistant to hormonal therapy.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The differences in E2- and anastrozole-dependent transcription regulation should help us better understand mechanisms of anastrozole resistance and could help identify additional drug targets or treatment options to overcome AI resistance
