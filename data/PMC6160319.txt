0	Type 2 diabetes	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Although type 2 diabetes (T2D) results from metabolic defects in insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity, most of the genetic risk loci identified to date relates to insulin secretion.
0	insulin deficiency	insulin	NA	ABSTRACT	We reported that T2D loci influencing insulin sensitivity may be identified through interactions with insulin secretion loci, thereby leading to T2D.
0	insulin deficiency	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Here, we hypothesize that joint testing of variant main effects and interaction effects with an insulin secretion locus increases power to identify genetic interactions leading to T2D.

0	insulin deficiency	insulin	NA	INTRO	We hypothesized that T2D risk loci, particularly those loci affecting insulin sensitivity, could be identified by interaction analyses with insulin secretion loci.
0	insulin deficiency	NA	NA	INTRO	This hypothesis was based on physiological observations that strongly suggest non-additive interaction between insulin secretion deficits and insulin resistance resulting in T2D.

1	insulin deficiency	MTNR1B	rs10830963	INTRO	In this report, we extend genome-wide interaction analysis by incorporating both main and interaction effects in a two degree-of-freedom joint test to search for variants with marginal effects as well as interacting with the intronic insulin secretion variant rs10830963 in MTNR1B, a genetic variant powerfully associated with AIRg (P=1.20x10-5 in a study of 492 African American individuals examining association with 247,870 variants from an exome microarray) and fasting glucose (P=9.29x10-15 in 20,209 African Americans), to increase T2D risk in African Americans.

0	NA	adiponectin	rs56823429	DISCUSS	Variants at this locus have previously been associated with HDL cholesterol (rs56823429, P=2x10-8), adiponectin levels (rs12051272, P=6x10-48), and WHR adjusted for BMI (rs2925979, P=7x10-13) in populations of European (EUR) descent and adiponectin levels (rs2925979, P=2x10-10), fasting glucose (rs16955379, P=0.03), and T2D (rs16955379, P=3x10-7) in populations of East Asian (EAS) descent.
1	NA	CMIP	rs17197883	DISCUSS	All of the previously described variants at the CMIP locus are in weak LD with rs17197883 (r2<0.2).
1	NA	NA	rs17197883	DISCUSS	There is no surrogate SNPs in high LD (r2 > 0.6 in 1000 Genomes AFR population) with rs17197883, In addition, rs17197883 did not reside in a regulatory region and did not regulate nearby gene expression by HaploReg analysis.
1	NA	NA	rs10830963	DISCUSS	Interestingly, the frequency of the rs10830963 AIRg-lowering allele (G) is much higher in these populations compared to African Americans (AfA) (EAS=42%, EUR=29%, AfA=7%).
1	NA	CMIP	rs10830963	DISCUSS	Thus, associations of SNPs at the CMIP locus with T2D and biomarkers related to insulin resistance in individuals of EUR and EAS descent may reflect an underlying interaction with rs10830963 that is partially unmasked in these populations.

0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This study was conducted to explore the impact of three methodological additions to an analysis model focused solely on the interaction term.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	First, after observing homogeneity in genetic effects across cohorts in a prior study, we pooled (as opposed to meta-analyzed) samples from five African American T2D studies.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Sung et al.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	suggested that results from pooled analysis and meta-analysis for main, interaction, and joint effects are largely consistent.
1	NA	NA	rs17197883	DISCUSS	Notably, we detected an interaction P-value reaching genome-wide significance (rs17197883, PINTXN=1.43x10-8) in a pooled analysis, which is an order of magnitude smaller compared to the most significant P-value (rs16924460, PINTXN=1.70x10-7) in our previous meta-analyzed study.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, it is difficult to assess the impact of pooling samples due to additional methodological differences.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	For example, additional quality control identified some samples that were duplicated or had other quality control issues
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Second, we used genotype data imputed to a 1000 Genomes Project phase 1 reference panel.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Compared to the HapMap reference panel previously used for imputation, the 1000 Genomes Project panel provides greater coverage of common variation and facilitates overall improvement of imputation quality.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This expanded genotype data allowed for analysis of 9,085,034 autosomal SNPs with MAF >5% in our study cohorts, compared to 2,907,086 autosomal SNPs with a MAF >1% in the prior analysis.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The MAF threshold was increased in the current study to overcome the inherent power loss and potential for false positives for interaction analyses incorporating a low frequency exposure
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Finally, in addition to hypothesis testing of the interaction term in our models, this analysis incorporates the Kraft 2 degree-of-freedom test to jointly analyze marginal and interaction effects.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This joint test allows for the detection of variants with both additive and non-additive effects contributing to T2D risk.
1	insulin deficiency	MTNR1B	rs10830963	DISCUSS	The skew toward more significant joint effect P-values in Figure 1 suggests that genome-wide interaction analysis with a well-defined insulin secretion variant (e.g., MTNR1B SNP rs10830963) incorporating a 2 degrees-of-freedom hypothesis test is a powerful approach for detection of novel T2D risk loci.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In this figure, 3,435,184 out of 9,085,034 (37.8%) SNPs had a more significant joint effect P-value compared to the main effect P-value from an association model excluding the interaction term.
1	NA	TCF7L2	NA	DISCUSS	The SNPs in TCF7L2 fall below the line of identity on the main effect axis, while the CMIP SNP, plus many others fall above the line of identity, thus comparing power between the two tests.
0	insulin deficiency	NA	NA	DISCUSS	These results suggest that established T2D loci, originally identified by strong SNP main effects in a typical univariate association analysis and largely involved in insulin secretion biology themselves, are not likely candidates for interaction with insulin secretion loci.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Alternatively, these established T2D loci, primarily discovered in European populations, do not exhibit strong SNP main effects in African American populations and may have a limited interaction effect to impact association with T2D
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	To analyze performance of the joint test for known T2D loci, we compared main and joint effect P-values for the most significant African American SNP at 20 established T2D loci that exhibited trans-ethnic transferability in MEDIA.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Figure 2 shows that SNPs from 3 loci, IGF2-INS-TH, SLC11A2, and HMGA2, had a more significant joint effect P-value compared to the main effect P-value.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This result combined with the observation from Figure 1 suggests that the joint test is a powerful approach for detection of novel T2D loci, but a typical association model may be more powerful for established loci
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This study has limitations.
1	NA	NA	rs10830963	DISCUSS	To validate these findings, genome-wide interactions with rs10830963 associated with T2D must be replicated in additional studies, including studies of other ethnicities.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Additionally, we did not account for gene-environment interactions which may account for T2D risk.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Interactions with or stratified analysis of sex, age, BMI, and age at diagnosis may be appropriate in follow-up studies.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	It is also important to note that statistical interaction does not imply biological interaction, as the statistical interaction may be mediated through multiple biological factors.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, statistical interaction may revealed novel loci which may not have strong marginal effect
0	insulin deficiency	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In summary, the present findings demonstrate that analysis of physiologically defined genome-wide interactions with variants strongly associated with insulin secretion is a potentially powerful approach for discovery of novel T2D loci and for expanding the knowledgebase of disease etiology.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	A similar approach examining interactions with variants associated with key biomarkers may be of wider relevance in other complex human diseases.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Results highlight the need for further study of genetic variation underlying T2D risk in African Americans as a means to improve our overall understanding of this disease
