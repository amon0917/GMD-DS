0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	In stage 1, 34,174 samples were genotyped using a whole-exome microarray.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	In stage 2, we tested associated variants (P<1x10-4) in 35,962 independent samples using de novo genotyping and imputed genotypes.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	In stage 3, an additional 14,997 samples were used to test the most significant stage 2 associations (P<5x10-8) using imputed genotypes.
1	NA	PLCG2	NA	ABSTRACT	We observed 3 novel genome-wide significant (GWS) AD associated non-synonymous variants; a protective variant in PLCG2 (rs72824905/p.P522R, P=5.38x10-10, OR=0.68, MAFcases=0.0059, MAFcontrols=0.0093), a risk variant in ABI3 (rs616338/p.S209F, P=4.56x10-10, OR=1.43, MAFcases=0.011, MAFcontrols=0.008), and a novel GWS variant in TREM2 (rs143332484/p.R62H, P=1.55x10-14, OR=1.67, MAFcases=0.0143, MAFcontrols=0.0089), a known AD susceptibility gene.

0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	These genetic findings provide additional evidence that the microglia-mediated innate immune response contributes directly to AD development
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Late-onset AD (LOAD) has a significant genetic component (h2=58-79%).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Nearly 30 LOAD susceptibility loci are known, and risk is significantly polygenic.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	However, these loci explain only a proportion of disease heritability.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Rare variants also contribute to disease risk.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Recent sequencing studies identified a number of genes that have rare variants associated with AD.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Our approach to rare-variant discovery is to genotype a large sample with micro-arrays targeting known exome variants with follow-up using genotyping and imputed genotypes in a large independent sample.

0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	We applied a 3-stage design (Supplementary Figure 1) using subjects from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP)(Table 1, Supplementary Tables 1 & 2).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In stage 1, 16,097 LOAD cases and 18,077 cognitively normal elderly controls were genotyped using the Illumina HumanExome microarray.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Data from multiple consortia were combined in a single variant meta-analysis (Online Methods) assuming an additive model.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In total, 241,551 variants passed quality-control (Supplementary Table 3).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Of these 203,902 were polymorphic, 26,947 were common (minor allele frequency (MAF)>=5%), and 176,955 were low frequency or rare (MAF<5%).

0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Rare and low frequency variants were analyzed using the score test and data combined with SeqMeta (Supplementary Figure 2)
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We reviewed cluster plots for variants showing association (P<1x10-4) and identified 43 candidate variants (Supplementary Table 4) exclusive of known risk loci (Supplementary Table 5).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Stage 2 tested these for association in 14,041 LOAD cases and 21,921 controls, using de novo and imputation derived genotypes (Online Methods).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We carried forward single nucleotide variants (SNVs) with GWS associations and consistent directions of effect to stage 3 where genotypes for 6,652 independent cases and 8,345 controls were imputed using the Haplotype Reference Consortium resource (Online Methods, Supplementary Table 6)
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We identified four rare coding variants with GWS association signals with LOAD (P<5x10-8)(Table 2, Supplementary Tables 7 & 8).
0	NA	PLCG2	rs72824905	INTRO	The first is a missense variant p.P522R (P=5.38x10-10, OR=0.68) in Phospholipase C Gamma 2 (PLCG2)(Table 2, Figure 1a, Supplementary Table 9, Supplementary Figure 3).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	This variant is associated with decreased risk of LOAD, showing a MAF of 0.0059 in cases and 0.0093 in controls.
0	NA	NA	rs72824905	INTRO	The reference allele (p.P522) is conserved across several species (Supplementary Figure 4).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Gene-wide analysis showed nominal evidence for association at P=1.52x10-4 (Supplementary Tables 10 & 11) and we found no other independent association at this gene (Supplementary Figure 5)
1	NA	ABI3	rs616338	INTRO	The second novel association is a missense change p.S209F (P=4.56x10-10, OR=1.43) in B3 domain-containing transcription factor ABI3 (ABI3).
1	NA	NA	rs616338	INTRO	The p.F209 variant shows consistent evidence for increasing LOAD risk across all stages, with a MAF of 0.011 in cases and 0.008 in controls (Table 2, Figure 1b, Supplementary Table 12, Supplementary Figure 6).

1	NA	B4GALNT2	NA	INTRO	The B4GALNT2 gene, adjacent to ABI3, contained an independent suggestive association (Supplementary Figure 8), but this failed to replicate in subsequent stages (Pcombined=1.68x10-4)(Supplementary Table 7)
1	NA	TREM2	rs143332484	INTRO	Following reports of suggestive association with LOAD, we report the first evidence for GWS association at TREM2 coding variant p.R62H (P=1.55x10-14, OR=1.67), with a MAF of 0.0143 in cases and 0.0089 in controls (Table 2, Figure 1c, Supplementary Table 13, Supplementary Figures 9 & 10).
1	NA	TREM2	R47H	INTRO	We also observed evidence for the previously reported TREM2 rare variant p.R47H (Table 2).
1	NA	NA	rs143332484	INTRO	These variants are not in linkage disequilibrium (Supplementary Table 14) and conditional analyses confirmed that p.R62H and p.R47H are independent risk variants (Supplementary Figure 11).
1	NA	TREM2	NA	INTRO	Gene-wide analysis of TREM2 showed a GWS association (PSKAT=1.42x10-15)(Supplementary Tables 10 & 11).

0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We also performed pathway analyses on the rare variant data presented here using all 9,816 pathways used previously.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The top pathways are related to lipoprotein particles, cholesterol efflux, B-cell differentiation and immune response, areas of biology also enriched when common variants are analyzed(Supplementary Table 16)
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Previous analysis of normal brain co-expression networks identified 4 gene modules that are enriched for common variants associated with LOAD risk.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	These 4 modules are enriched for immune response genes.
0	NA	MAF>1%	NA	INTRO	We identified 151 genes present in 2 or more of these 4 modules and these showed a strong enrichment for LOAD-associated common variants (P=4.0x10-6) and for rare variants described here (MAF<1%)(Supplementary Table 15P=1.17x10-6).
1	NA	PLCG2	NA	INTRO	We then used a set of high-quality protein-protein interactions to construct, from these 151 genes, an interaction network containing 56 genes, including PLCG2, ABI3 and TREM2 (Figure 2)(Online Methods).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	This subset is strongly enriched for association signals from both the previous common variant analysis (P=5.0x10-6, Supplementary Table 17) and this rare variant gene-set analysis (P=1.08x10-7, Supplementary Table 15).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The remaining 95 genes only have nominally-significant enrichment for either common or rare variants (Supplementary Tables 15 & 17), suggesting that the 56-gene (Supplementary Table 18) network is driving the enrichment
1	NA	TREM2	NA	INTRO	TREM2, ABI3 and PLCG2 have a common expression pattern in human brain cortex, with high expression in microglia cells and limited expression in neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and endothelial cells (Supplementary Figure 12).

0	NA	PLCG2	NA	INTRO	PLCG2 (Supplementary Figure 13) encodes a transmembrane signaling enzyme (PLCgamma2) that hydrolyses the membrane phospholipid PIP2 (1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol 4,5-bisphosphate) to secondary messengers IP3 (myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate) and DAG (diacylglycerol).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	IP3 is released into the cytosol and acts at the endoplasmic reticulum where it binds to ligand-gated ion channels to increase cytoplasmic Ca2+.
0	NA	p<10-5	NA	INTRO	DAG remains bound to the plasma membrane where it activates two major signaling molecules, protein kinase C (PKC) and Ras guanyl nucleotide-releasing proteins (RasGRPs), which initiate the NF-kappaB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways.
0	NA	PLCG2	NA	INTRO	While the IP3/DAG/Ca+2 signaling pathway is active in many cells and tissues, in brain, PLCG2 is primarily expressed in microglial cells.

1	NA	ABI3	NA	METHODS	Association analyses performed followed Stage 1 and Stage 2 analytical procedures described below, and only variants in ABI3, PLCG2 and TREM2 were examined.
1	NA	ABI3	NA	METHODS	For gene-based testing, 10 variants in ABI3, 35 in PLCG2, and 13 in TREM2 were examined
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The eight biological pathway clusters previously identified as enriched for association in the IGAP dataset were tested for enrichment in this rare variation study (Supplementary Table 15) in order to test whether the biological enrichments observed in common variants also apply to rare variants.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Genes were defined without surrounding genomic sequence, as this yielded the most significant excess of enriched pathways in the common variation dataset.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Gene-wide SKAT-O P-values for the variants of interest were combined using the Fisher's combined probability test.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Given the low degree of LD between rare variants our primary analyses did not control for LD between pathway genes.
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	METHODS	However, as a secondary analysis, the APOE region was removed, and for each pair of pathway genes within 1Mb of each other, the gene with the more significant SKAT-O P-value was removed.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	This highly conservative procedure removes any potential bias in the enrichment test both from LD between the genes, and also from dropping less significant genes from the analysis
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We also performed pathway analyses on the rare variant data presented here using all 9,816 pathways used previously.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The top pathways are related to lipoprotein particles, cholesterol efflux, B-cell differentiation and immune response, and closely parallel the common variant results (Supplementary Table 16)
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	"Choose a gene to start the network (the ""seed"" gene"
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	For each remaining gene in the set of 151 genes, add it to the network if its corresponding protein shows a high-confidence protein interaction with a protein corresponding to any gene already in the network
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Repeat step 2 until no more genes can be adde
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Repeat, choosing each of the 151 genes in turn as the seed gene
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Previous analysis of normal brain co-expression networks identified 4 gene modules that were enriched for common variants associated with AD risk in the IGAP GWAS.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Each of these 4 modules was also found to be enriched for immune-related genes.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The 151 genes present in 2 or more of these 4 modules were particularly strongly enriched for IGAP GWAS association.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	This set of 151 co-expressed genes thus contains genes of relevance to AD aetiology.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	To identify these genes, and clarify biological relationships between them for future study, protein interaction analysis was performed.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	First, a list of high-confidence (confidence score >0.7) human protein-protein interactions was downloaded from the latest version (v10) of the STRING database (http://string-db.org).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Then, protein interaction networks were generated as follows:
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The largest protein interaction network resulting from this procedure resulted in a network of 56 genes connected by high-confidence protein interactions.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	To test whether this network was larger than expected by chance, given the total number of protein-protein interactions for each gene, random sets of 151 genes were generated, with each gene chosen to have the same total number of protein-protein interactions as the corresponding gene in the actual data.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Protein networks were generated for each gene as described above, and the size of the largest such network compared to the observed 56-gene network.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	1000 random gene sets were generated, and none of them yielded a protein interaction network as large as 56 genes.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Note that the procedure for generating the protein interaction network relies only on protein interaction data, and is agnostic to the strength of GWAS or rare-variant association for each gene.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Thus the strength of genetic association in the set of 56 network genes can be tested relative to that in the original set of 151 genes without bias
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The set of 56 network genes was tested for association enrichment in the IGAP GWAS using ALIGATOR, as was done in the original pathway analysis, using a range of p-value thresholds for defining significant SNPs (and thus the genes containing those SNPs).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The same analysis was also performed on the 95 genes in the module overlap but not the protein interaction network (Supplementary Table 17).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	It can be seen that the 56 network genes account for most of the enrichment signal observed in the set of 151 module overlap genes
0	NA	MAF>1%	NA	METHODS	The set of 56 network genes, the set of 151 module overlap genes, and the set of 95 genes in the module overlap but not the network were tested for enrichment of association signal in variants with MAF<1% using the gene set enrichment method described above in section 11.
0	NA	MAF>1%	NA	METHODS	Both the set of 151 genes (P=1.17x10-6) and the subset of 56 genes (P =1.08x10-7) show highly significant enrichment for association in the rare variants with MAF<1%.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	It can be seen that the 56 network genes account for most of the enrichment signal observed in the set of 151 module overlap genes (Supplementary Table 17).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Again, the subset of 56 genes accounts for most of the enrichment signal observed in the set of 151 genes, as the remaining 95 genes have only nominally-significant enrichment (P=0.043).
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	METHODS	Both the set of 151 genes (P=5.15x10-5) and the subset of 56 genes (P=2.98x10-7) show significant enrichment under a conservative analysis excluding the APOE region and correcting for possible LD between the genes (Supplementary Table 17).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Thus, the rare variants show convincing replication of the biological signal observed in the common variant GWAS, and furthermore, the protein network analysis has refined this signal to a set of 56 interacting genes.
1	NA	TREM2	NA	METHODS	Given that TREM2 has a highly significant gene-wide p-value (P=1.01x10-13) among variants with MAF<1%, enrichment analyses were run omitting it.
1	NA	TREM2	NA	METHODS	Both the set of 151 genes (P=2.78x10-3) and the subset of 56 genes (P=0.010) (Supplementary Table 18) still showed significant enrichment of signal, suggesting that the contribution of rare variants to disease susceptibility in these networks is not restricted to TREM2.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Biological follow-up of genetic results is labour-intensive and expensive.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	It is therefore important to concentrate such work on the genes that are most important to AD susceptibility.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Thus, the rationale for reducing the gene set is that it defines a network of genes that are not only related through co-expression and protein interaction, but also show enrichment for genetic association signal.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	These genes are therefore strong candidates for future biological study
1	NA	PLCG2	NA	METHODS	We examined mRNA expression of the novel genes PLCG2 and ABI3 in neuropathologically characterized brain post-mortem tissue (508 persons): they are expressed at low levels in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of subjects from two studies of aging with prospective autopsy (ranked 12,965th out of 13,484 expressed genes).
1	NA	ABI3	NA	METHODS	However, ABI3 and PLCG2 were more highly expressed in purified microglia/macrophage from the cortex of 11 subjects from these cohorts (1740th and 2600th respectively out of the 11,500 expressed genes)(unpublished data).
1	NA	PLCG2	NA	METHODS	These findings are consistent with the high levels of expression of both PLCG2 and ABI3 in peripheral monocytes, spleen, and whole blood reported by the ROADmap project and in microglia as reported by Zhang et al.
1	NA	PLCG2	NA	METHODS	From the same brain tissue, we examined methylation (n=714) and H3K9ac acetylation (n=676) data and found differential methylation at four CpG sites and lower acetylation at two H3K9ac sites adjacent to PLCG2 and ABI3 in relation to increased global neuritic plaque and tangle burden (FDR < 0.05).
1	NA	TREM2	NA	METHODS	Similarly, high TREM2 expression has been shown to correlate with increasing neuritic plaque burden
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	RNA sequencing was used to measure gene expression levels in the temporal cortex of 80 subjects with pathologically confirmed AD and 76 controls without any neurodegenerative pathologies obtained from the Mayo Clinic Brain Bank and the Banner Sun Health Institute.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The human RNA sequencing data is deposited in the Accelerating Medicines Partnership-AD (AMP-AD) knowledge portal housed in Synapse (https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn2580853/wiki/66722).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	After QC, our postmortem human cohort has 80 subjects with pathologically confirmed AD and 76 controls without any neurodegenerative pathologies.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Assuming two samples of 100 per group, two-sample t-test, same standard deviation, we will have 80% power to detect effect sizes of 0.40, 0.49 and 0.59 at p<0.05, 0.01 and 0.001, respectively, where effect size is the difference in means between two groups divided by the within-group standard deviation.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The human RNA sequencing data overview, QC and analytic methods are available at the following Synapse pages, respectively: syn3163039, syn6126114, syn6090802.
0	death	NA	NA	METHODS	Multivariable linear regression was used to test for association of gene expression levels with AD diagnosis (Dx) using two different models: In the Simple model, we adjust for age at death, sex, RNA integrity number (RIN), tissue source, and RNAseq flowcell.
0	Alzheimer's disease	OLIG2	NA	METHODS	In the Comprehensive model, we adjust for all these covariates, and brain cell type markers for five cell-specific genes (CD68 (microglia), CD34 (endothelial), OLIG2 (oligodendroglia), GFAP (astrocyte), ENO2 (neuron)) to account for cell number changes that occur with AD neuropathology.
1	NA	TREM2	NA	METHODS	TREM2, PLCG2 and ABI3 are significantly higher in AD temporal cortex prior to correcting for cell types (Simple model), but this significance is abolished after adjusting for cell-specific gene counts (Comprehensive model).
1	NA	TREM2	NA	METHODS	This suggests that these elevations are likely a consequence of changes in cell types that occur with AD, most likely microgliosis given that TREM2, PLCG2 and ABI3 are microglia-enriched genes (Supplementary Table 19, Supplementary Figure 12)
