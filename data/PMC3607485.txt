0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	While lung cancer is largely caused by tobacco smoking, there is increasing evidence for the role of inherited genetic factors in disease etiology.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Notably, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of lung cancer have robustly demonstrated that polymorphic variation at 5p15.33 (TERT/CLPTM1L), 6p21.33 (BAT3/MSH5) and 15q25.1 (CHRNA5/CHRNA3/CHRNB4) influences lung cancer risk in European populations.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Additionally, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at 22q12 and the 15q15.2 locus containing the TP53-binding protein 1 gene have been associated with lung cancer risk.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Three additional susceptibility regions at 13q12.12, 22q12.2 and 3q28 have been identified in GWASs on Asian populations, but to date these regions have not been implicated in lung cancer risk in individuals of European ancestry
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Given the biological differences across lung cancer subtypes, histology- and smoking-specific associations have been conducted.
1	NSCLC-adenocarcinoma	TERT	rs2736100	INTRO	Analyses have shown that SNP rs2736100 (TERT) is primarily associated with adenocarcinoma risk and variation in RAD52 at 12p13 with squamous cell carcinoma risk.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Significant heterogeneity by smoking status and age of onset has been shown for SNPs at the 15q25 locus harboring nicotinic acetylcholine receptor genes
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The statistical power of individual GWAS has been limited by the modest effect sizes of genetic variants, the need to establish stringent thresholds of statistical significance and financial constraints on the numbers of variants that could be studied.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Additionally, due to sample size limitations, few comprehensive histology and smoking history subgroup analyses have been performed in individual GWAS.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Meta-analysis of existing GWAS data therefore offers the opportunity to discover additional disease loci harboring common variants associated with lung cancer risk and explore the variability in genetic effects according to disease heterogeneity

0	NSCLC-adenocarcinoma	TERT	rs2736100	DISCUSS	Although indirect, the possibility that the association between rs2736100 and adenocarcinoma risk is mediated through an effect on TERT is supported by an observation of TERT amplification and mRNA overexpression in adenocarcinoma, as well as the inhibition of lung adenocarcinoma cell growth promoted by the suppression of hTERT expression
0	squamous disease	CLPTM1L	NA	DISCUSS	The CLPTM1L association appears stronger in squamous cell lung carcinoma and large-cell lung cancer, two histology groups strongly linked to tobacco smoking.
0	NA	CLPTM1L	rs402710	DISCUSS	This is consistent with the finding that a variant in CLPTM1L (rs402710, G) has been associated with high levels of DNA adducts caused by smoking
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	A role for the 6p21-6p22 locus in lung cancer development has been previously shown by some, but not all studies.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This meta-analysis identified 61 SNPs at 6p21-6p22 showing a significant association with lung cancer risk.
0	squamous disease	NA	rs3117582	DISCUSS	Most of these SNPs were highly correlated with rs3117582, which had the strongest effect for the squamous cell carcinoma.
0	NA	BAT3	rs3117582	DISCUSS	rs3117582 is located 73 bp 5' of the gene encoding BCL2-associated athanogene 6 (BAG6/BAT3), which belongs to a BAG domain containing a family of proteins that interact with Hsp70/Hsc70.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	BAT3/BAG6-deficient mice are embryonic lethal with defects in the development of the lung, brain and kidney.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	BAT3/BAG6 plays an essential role in p53-mediated apoptosis induced by genotoxic stress.
0	NA	MSH5	rs3117582	DISCUSS	rs3117582 is in perfect LD with rs3131379, which maps to intron 10 of the DNA mismatch repair mutS homolog 5 (Escherichia coli) (MSH5) gene.
0	NA	BAT3	NA	DISCUSS	Both BAT3 and MSH5 are expressed in lung tissue and are strong potential candidates for being the functional basis for the association.
0	squamous disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Since the development of squamous cell lung cancer is strongly influenced by environmental exposure to carcinogens that cause DNA damage, it is highly plausible that genetic variation in the DNA repair mechanism and/or DNA-damage-induced apoptosis would play an etiologic role
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The 9p21.3 region encodes three tumor suppressor genes that play key roles in cell cycle inhibition, senescence and stress-induced apoptosis: CDKN2A/p16INK4A (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors 2A), p14ARF (alternative transcript generated by alternative exon 1 of CDKN2A/p16INK4A) and CDKN2B/p15INK4B (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors 2B).
0	melanoma	NA	NA	DISCUSS	CDKN2A/p16INK4A was originally identified as a melanoma susceptibility gene, but is inactivated in many tumors including lung cancer.
0	lung cancer	p15	NA	DISCUSS	9p21.3 variants associated with lung cancer risk in our study are located 5' upstream of CDKN2B, within the intronic region of the CDKN2B antisense RNA (ANRIL/CDKN2B-AS).
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Recent studies have demonstrated 9p21.3 to be a susceptibility locus in many GWASs including on breast cancer, glioma, type 2 diabetes, endometriosis, coronary artery disease, intracranial aneurysm and glaucoma.
0	lung cancer	CDKN2B-AS1	NA	DISCUSS	Several splice variants with varied enhancer activity have been described for ANRIL, including GQ495921, GQ495919 and GQ495923, which are expressed in lung cancer cell lines.
0	NA	CDKN2B-AS1	rs1333040	DISCUSS	Multiple SNPs, including rs1333040 reported here, have been shown to be associated with ANRIL mRNA expression in peripheral blood.
0	NA	CDKN2B-AS1	NA	DISCUSS	ANRIL recruits a polycomb repression complex (PRC2) to silence CDKN2B but not CDKN2A
0	NA	CDKN2B-AS1	rs1333040	DISCUSS	The identified SNP rs1333040 correlates (0.7 < r2 < 0.8) with 24 variants located within or 3'UTR downstream of CDKN2B-AS.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	None of these variants are located within the coding sequence.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, the possibility that the identified variant is tagging a functional SNP located directly within the CDKN2A/p16INK4A, p14ARF or CDKN2B/p15INK4B genes cannot be excluded.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Further studies are needed to evaluate the effect that the SNPs we identified may have on ANRIL/CKDN2B-AS
1	NA	RAD52	NA	DISCUSS	The 12p13 risk variants map within the RAD52 homolog gene which plays a role in DNA double-strand repair and homologous recombination.
1	prostate carcinogenesis	RAD52	NA	DISCUSS	A role of the RAD52 in lung carcinogenesis was originally proposed from a candidate gene study reported by Danoy et al., a finding confirmed by a pathway-based analysis using GWAS data from the National Cancer Institute (NCI), UK, and the MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) studies which robustly demonstrated an association for squamous lung cancer.
1	NA	RAD52	NA	DISCUSS	The role of RAD52 in repairing double-strand breaks induced by tobacco smoking is supported by the association being confined to smokers
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The present study has confirmed the smoking-related effect of 15q25 variation on lung cancer risk and has provided additional support for the existence of several independent disease loci within the CHRNA5/CHRNA3/CHRNB4 region.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This is consistent with genotyping data which has shown several distinct signals for smoking behavior and lung cancer risk within this region.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Saccone et al.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	described four distinct loci influencing smoking behavior at 15q25 with at least two of them (locus 1 annotated by rs1051730/rs16969968 and locus 3 annotated by rs588765) having independent effects on smoking behavior.
0	NA	NA	rs6495308	DISCUSS	The second locus annotated by rs6495308 was more strongly associated with heavy smoking.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In contrast, the Oxford-GlaxoSmithKline study reported a secondary locus distinct from rs6495308
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our current study supports the existence of the two distinct signals defined by rs1051730/rs16969968 and rs6495309/rs6495308/rs2036534.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Reciprocal attenuation of the effects for these two signals when allele dosage for an opposite variant is included into a model raises the possibility of an underlying haplotypic effect (r2 = 0.17, D' = 1.0 between these two SNPs) or an imperfect correlation with an unknown functional variant.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We also observed an effect for rs680244/rs6495306 (r2 = 1.0, D' = 1.0 with rs588765 for both) in our meta-analysis, which remained significant at a genome-wide level when controlled for rs6495309 and strongly diminished when controlled for both rs1051730 and rs6495309.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This suggests that the rs588765/rs680244/rs6495306 effect on lung cancer risk is not independent.
0	NA	NA	rs1051730	DISCUSS	Similar to the earlier observation from Saccone et al., these variants had opposite effects when adjusted for rs1051730, which may reflect a haplotypic organization in which the rs1051730 allele increases risk while other associated SNPs decrease the risk
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our study confirmed a different genetic background for the two major histological subtypes of lung cancer:squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Although the role of the CHRNA5/CHRNA3/CHRNB4 locus at 15q25 and, to some extent, the CLPTM1L locus at 5p15.33 appeared independent from the histology type, all other identified genomic regions showed strong heterogeneity by histology, suggesting different genetic etiologies for these lung cancer subtypes.
1	squamous disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The significance of cell cycle control (CDKN2A/ARF/CDKN2B/ANRIL), DNA damage response and DNA repair genes (RAD52 and BAT3/MSH5) in squamous cell carcinoma is consistent with the notion of a particularly strong effect of smoking on the development of this histological subtype and suggests candidate drug targets that may have clinical utility
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The power of the meta-analysis to identify 5p15.33, 6p21-6p22 and 15q25.1 risk SNPs and loci was over 90%, making it unlikely that additional lung cancer susceptibility variants of similar magnitude and allele frequencies can be identified by simply increasing sample size in Europeans.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In contrast, the power of our study was limited to detect rarer variants (i.e.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	MAFs < 0.05) and common variants of a small effect size (i.e.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	RR <= 1.05) and/or with modest effects confined to a specific histology (Supplementary Material, Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	S8).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The present study was also limited to the genetic variants tagged by the genotyping arrays used.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Several novel variants were identified within 5p15.33, 6p21-6p22, 9p21.3, 12p13.33 and 15q25.1 through imputation.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The imputed variants correlated with the previously genotyped SNPs in individuals of European descendents, suggesting no additional independent signal within known loci to be identified.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, the replication of imputed variants by direct genotyping would be helpful to completely characterize the strength of effects of these SNPs
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In summary, by pooling results from 16 GWASs, we have been able to comprehensively assay the relationship between common genetic variation and lung cancer risk.
0	squamous disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Furthermore, we have been able to demonstrate a novel relationship between 9p21.3 variation and squamous cell lung carcinoma.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This study provides valuable insights into the pathogenesis of lung cancer, indicating that there is etiological heterogeneity to disease development which is influenced by inherited genetic variation.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The identification of additional risk loci is likely to require genotyping larger series using arrays formatted to capture variants poorly tagged by current platforms
