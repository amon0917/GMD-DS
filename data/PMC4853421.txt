0	breast cancer	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Common variants in 94 loci have been associated with breast cancer including 15 loci with genome-wide significant associations (P<5 x 10-8) with oestrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer and BRCA1-associated breast cancer risk.
0	NA	BRCA1	NA	ABSTRACT	In this study, to identify new ER-negative susceptibility loci, we performed a meta-analysis of 11 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) consisting of 4,939 ER-negative cases and 14,352 controls, combined with 7,333 ER-negative cases and 42,468 controls and 15,252 BRCA1 mutation carriers genotyped on the iCOGS array.
1	breast cancer	KLF5	NA	ABSTRACT	We identify four previously unidentified loci including two loci at 13q22 near KLF5, a 2p23.2 locus near WDR43 and a 2q33 locus near PPIL3 that display genome-wide significant associations with ER-negative breast cancer.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	In addition, 19 known breast cancer risk loci have genome-wide significant associations and 40 had moderate associations (P<0.05) with ER-negative disease.
1	breast cancer	TRMT61B	NA	ABSTRACT	Using functional and eQTL studies we implicate TRMT61B and WDR43 at 2p23.2 and PPIL3 at 2q33 in ER-negative breast cancer aetiology.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	All ER-negative loci combined account for ~11% of familial relative risk for ER-negative disease and may contribute to improved ER-negative and BRCA1 breast cancer risk prediction
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	 Oestrogen negative breast cancer is associated with a poor prognosis.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	In this study, the authors perform a meta-analysis of 11 breast cancer genome-wide association studies and identify four new loci associated with oestrogen negative breast cancer risk.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	These findings may aid in stratifying patients in the clinic
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease that can be separated into clinical subtypes based on tumour histological markers, such as the oestrogen receptor (ER).
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	ER-negative disease accounts for 20-30% of all breast cancers, is more common in women diagnosed at young age and in women of African ancestry, and is associated with worse short-term outcome than ER-positive disease.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	ER-negative and ER-positive breast cancer also exhibit different patterns of genetic susceptibility.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Currently, 94 loci containing common breast cancer risk-associated variants have been associated with breast cancer through genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and large replication studies.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	However, only 14 loci have shown genome-wide significant associations (P<5 x 10-8) with ER-negative disease.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	While this partly reflects the smaller sample size for ER-negative disease, the majority of the known breast cancer loci show differences in relative risk by subtype.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In particular, 6 of the 14 loci associated with ER-negative disease at genome-wide significance show no evidence of association with ER-positive disease.
0	breast cancer	BRCA1	NA	INTRO	The alleles associated with ER-negative breast cancer at these loci have also been associated with breast cancer risk in BRCA1 mutation carriers, consistent with the finding that the majority of breast tumours arising in BRCA1 mutation carriers show low/absent expression of ER.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	These observations suggest that a meta-analysis of results from ER-negative breast cancer and BRCA1 breast cancer association studies could identify additional ER-negative susceptibility loci that were not found previously because of limited sample size
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	In this study, we carried out a meta-analysis of breast cancer GWAS studies and found four new loci associated with developing ER-negative breast cancer
0	breast cancer	BRCA1	NA	RESULTS	Genotype data for this meta-analysis were obtained from three sources: (1) 11 breast cancer GWAS included 5,139 ER-negative breast cancer cases and 14,352 controls (Supplementary Table 1); (2) The Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) included 7,333 ER-negative breast cancer cases and 42,468 study-matched controls genotyped on the iCOGS (Collaborative Oncological Gene-environment Study) custom array; (3) The Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA1/2 (CIMBA) included 15,252 BRCA1 mutation carriers (7,797 with breast cancer and 7,455 unaffected) genotyped on the iCOGS array (Supplementary Tables 2-4).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Imputation was performed using the 1000 Genomes project as a reference, and a meta-analysis was performed based on 10,909,381 common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that passed quality control (Supplementary Table 1)
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	RESULTS	We first considered SNPs in 94 regions in which genome-wide significant associations for breast cancer had been identified (Methods).
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	RESULTS	In 55 of these, the SNP most significantly associated with overall breast cancer risk was significantly associated (P<0.05) with ER-negative breast cancer in the meta-analysis.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	RESULTS	Four more were associated with ER-negative breast cancer in the general population (P<0.05) but not in the meta-analysis, and 15 displayed genome-wide significant (P<5 x 10-8) associations with ER-negative breast cancer (Supplementary Table 5).
1	NA	PEX14	rs10864459	RESULTS	In addition, new SNPs in three loci (rs10864459 from 1p36.2 PEX14, rs11903787 from INHBB and rs4980383 from 11p15.5 LSP1) were found to have genome-wide significant associations with ER-negative disease (Table 1, Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	1, Supplementary Table 5).
1	breast cancer	TCF7L2	NA	RESULTS	Likewise, SNPs in the TCF7L2 locus previously associated with BRCA1 breast cancer and ER-positive breast cancer showed genome-wide significant associations with ER-negative breast cancer (Table 1).
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	RESULTS	Interestingly multiple independent signals in several loci were associated with ER-negative breast cancer.
1	breast cancer	TERT	NA	RESULTS	In particular, three independent regions in the TERT locus, two regions in PTHLH, and two regions in ESR1 displayed genome-wide significant associations with ER-negative breast cancer (Table 1).
1	breast cancer	FTO	rs11075995	RESULTS	Furthermore, while previous studies established genome-wide significant associations with ER-negative disease for rs11075995 in one 16q12.2 FTO locus, rs17817449 (r2=0.035) from a second FTO locus located 40 kb proximal to the rs11075995 tagged locus also displayed near-genome-wide significance (P=5.26 x 10-8) with ER-negative breast cancer in the meta-analysis (Table 1).
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	RESULTS	In addition to the breast cancer loci established in studies of European women, three additional breast cancer risk loci were recently identified in GWAS of Asian women.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	RESULTS	To generalize the results to other populations, associations between the three SNPs and breast cancer in the European, African American and Asian populations in the iCOGS study were evaluated.
0	breast cancer	NA	rs2290203	RESULTS	SNP rs2290203 showed only weak evidence of association (P=0.02), and rs4951011 and rs10474352 SNPs showed no evidence of association with ER-negative breast cancer in the white European meta-analysis (Supplementary Table 6)
0	breast cancer	BRCA1	NA	RESULTS	Among the 94 known risk loci from white European and three from Asian populations, only 24 contained SNPs with some evidence of association (P<0.05) with breast cancer risk among BRCA1 mutation carriers alone.
1	NA	PEX14	rs10864459	RESULTS	These included 21 loci based on known index SNPs (Supplementary Table 5) along with new SNPs from the meta-analysis in the PEX14 (rs10864459), INHBB (rs11903787) and PTHLH (rs7297051) loci (Table 1).
1	breast cancer	ER	rs2046210	RESULTS	Only the ESR1 (rs2046210), TERT (rs2242652) and two 19p13.1 (rs8170; rs56069439) loci had genome-wide significant associations with breast cancer risk for BRCA1 mutation carriers alone (Table 1, Supplementary Table 5).
0	breast cancer	BRCA1	NA	RESULTS	However, 15 of the 19 risk loci that reached genome-wide significance for ER-negative disease in the meta-analysis showed some evidence of association (P<0.05) with breast cancer risk for BRCA1 mutation carriers using a retrospective likelihood analysis.
0	breast cancer	BRCA1	NA	RESULTS	These SNPs had hazard ratio (HR) estimates in BRCA1 carriers that were similar to the odds ratio (OR) estimates for ER-negative breast cancer (Table 1).
1	breast cancer	LGR6	NA	RESULTS	In contrast, four SNPs in the LGR6, 2p24.1, ZNF365 and FTO loci had HR estimates ranging from 0.97 to 1.01 and were not significantly associated (P>0.05) with breast cancer risk for BRCA1 mutation carriers.
0	NA	BRCA1	NA	RESULTS	No significant interactions between the known risk SNPs were observed when pairwise interactions were evaluated separately in the general population (BCAC-iCOGS) or in BRCA1 carriers after adjusting for multiple testing
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Novel genome-wide significant associations (P<5 x 10-8) were detected with imputed and genotyped SNPs on chromosomes 2p23.2 and 13q22 (Table 2, Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	2, Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	1).
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	RESULTS	At 2p23.2, 79 SNPs exhibited genome-wide significant associations with ER-negative breast cancer (Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	2, Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	2, Supplementary Table 7).
1	NA	NA	rs4577244	RESULTS	The most significant genotyped and imputed SNPs at these two loci were rs4577244 (P=1.0 x 10-8) and rs67073037 (P=4.76 x 10-9), respectively (Table 2).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	To investigate the presence of independent signals at the 2p23.2 locus, conditional analyses were conducted adjusting for the lead SNP.
1	NA	NA	rs67073037	RESULTS	However, no significant (P<0.05) associations were observed at 2p23.2 after adjusting for rs67073037.
0	NA	NA	rs6562760	RESULTS	In the 13q22 locus, rs6562760 was the most strongly associated (P=5.0 x 10-10) SNP among 12 genome-wide significant SNPs (Table 2, Supplementary Table 8, Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	2, Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	1).
0	breast cancer	NA	rs6562760	RESULTS	Conditional analysis adjusting for rs6562760 yielded several SNPs with residual associations for ER-negative breast cancer, with rs17181761 (r2=0.51) as the most significantly associated (P=6.0 x 10-6) (Supplementary Table 9).
0	NA	p<10-4	rs6562760	RESULTS	No associations at P<10-4 remained after conditioning on both rs6562760 and rs17181761.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Thus, 13q22 appears to contain two independent ER-negative risk loci
1	breast cancer	NA	rs67073037	RESULTS	When considering only the data from the general population using the BCAC-iCOGS studies, no association between rs67073037 at 2p23.2 and ER-positive breast cancer was observed (Supplementary Table 10).
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	RESULTS	Consistent with this observation, a significant difference (Pdiff=4.45 x 10-6) in the per-allele ORs for ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancer was detected.
0	breast cancer	NA	rs17181761	RESULTS	In contrast, rs17181761 at 13q22 was weakly associated with ER-positive breast cancer (OR=1.03; P=0.030), but more strongly associated with ER-negative breast cancer (OR=1.08; Pdiff=5.82 x 10-3; Supplementary Table 10).
0	breast cancer	NA	rs6562760	RESULTS	Likewise, rs6562760 at 13q22 was more strongly associated with ER-negative than ER-positive breast cancer (ER-positive OR=0.98 versus ER-negative OR=0.92; Pdiff=0.028) (Supplementary Table 10).
1	NA	HER2	rs67073037	RESULTS	Among ER-negative cases, no significant differences in the ORs for triple negative (ER-negative, progesterone receptor negative, HER2 negative) and non-triple-negative cases was observed (rs67073037, Pdiff=0.26; rs6562760, Pdiff=0.36; rs17181761, Pdiff=0.69).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Q-tests were used to assess heterogeneity.
1	breast cancer	MDM4	NA	RESULTS	These results suggest that the three risk loci are largely specific to ER-negative but not triple-negative breast cancer, in contrast to loci in the MDM4, LGR6, 19p13.1 and TERT regions.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	RESULTS	To also investigate the impact of bilateral disease on the associations with ER-negative breast cancer in the general population, analyses were performed separately for BBCS alone, which oversampled for bilateral cases, and after exclusion of BBCS.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The risk estimates for each SNP (both in iCOGS and in the meta-analysis), after excluding BBCS, did not differ from the main results (Supplementary Table 11), and do not appear to be substantially influenced by bilateral cases
1	breast cancer	NA	rs67073037	RESULTS	Using the retrospective likelihood approach, index SNPs in the three 2p23.2 and 13q22 loci were all associated with BRCA1 breast cancer (rs67073037, P=4.58 x 10-4; rs6562760, P=2.85 x 10-6; rs17181761, P=9.29 x 10-3; Table 2).
0	NA	BRCA1	NA	RESULTS	There were no significant differences in the associations with ER-positive and ER-negative disease among BRCA1 carriers (Supplementary Table 12).
0	Colon and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer	BRCA1	NA	RESULTS	A competing risks analysis in BRCA1 mutation carriers that accounted for simultaneous associations with breast and ovarian cancer risks found similar HR estimates for breast cancer and no evidence of association with ovarian cancer risk (Supplementary Table 13).
0	breast cancer	BRCA2	NA	RESULTS	None of the SNPs were associated with overall breast cancer risk for BRCA2 mutation carriers (Supplementary Table 10).
0	breast cancer	BRCA1	NA	RESULTS	There was also no significant evidence of heterogeneity (P<0.05) between the effect estimates for BRCA1 mutation carriers and ER-negative breast cancer in the general population (BCAC-iCOGS; Intraclass Correlation).
0	NA	BRCA1	NA	RESULTS	Finally, no significant interactions between the three index SNPs and any of the 94 previously known loci were observed in BRCA1 carriers or in the general population after adjusting for multiple testing (Supplementary Table 14)
0	breast cancer	PPIL3	NA	RESULTS	Analysis of genotyped and imputed SNPs around known risk loci also detected near-genome-wide significant associations with ER-negative breast cancer in a region on 2q33 containing several genes including PPIL3 and the known CASP8 risk locus (Table 2).
0	breast cancer	NA	rs115635831	RESULTS	rs115635831 (P=1.26 x 10-7) and rs188686860 (P=8.34 x 10-8; r2=1.0), were the genotyped and imputed SNPs, respectively, most significantly associated with ER-negative breast cancer in this region.
0	NA	CLK1	rs74943274	RESULTS	These SNPs, along with the most proximal rs74943274 SNP (r2=0.97 with rs115635831), are located in CLK1 (Cdc-like kinase-1) and PPIL3 (Peptidylproplyl isomerase-Like 3) and are 350 kb upstream of CASP8 (Table 2, Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	2).
0	NA	CASP8	rs188686860	RESULTS	All 157 SNPs with highly significant associations (P<1 x 10-6) in this region, were in high linkage disequilibrium with rs188686860 and rs115635831 (r2>0.90), and were located proximal (Hg19: 201,717,014-201,995,860) to the CASP8 gene (Supplementary Table 15).
0	breast cancer	CASP8	NA	RESULTS	Fine mapping of the CASP8 locus has recently identified four independent signals associated with overall breast cancer risk.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The index SNPs for these independent signals range across a 350-kb region from 202,036,478 to 202,379,828.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	To determine whether these CASP8-associated signals accounted for the ER-negative associations in the meta-analysis, conditional analyses were conducted using the BCAC-iCOGS data.
0	breast cancer	CASP8	rs74943274	RESULTS	After accounting for the four CASP8 signals, rs74943274 retained evidence of an association with overall breast cancer (P=1.44 x 10-3) and a strong association with ER-negative breast cancer (P=1.34 x 10-5; Supplementary Table 16; Supplementary Fig.
0	breast cancer	NA	rs74943274	RESULTS	2), suggesting that rs74943274 and rs115635831 represents a novel locus associated with ER-negative breast cancer
0	breast cancer	NA	rs115635831	RESULTS	Further consideration of the BCAC-iCOGS data found no association for rs115635831 at 2q33 with ER-positive breast cancer (P=0.23) but identified a significant difference (Pdiff=2.9 x 10-4) in the per-allele ORs for ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancer (Q-test, Supplementary Table 10).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	No influence of bilateral disease was observed in sensitivity analyses (Supplementary Table 11).
0	breast cancer	NA	rs115635831	RESULTS	However, the index SNPs in the 2q33 locus were significantly associated with BRCA1 breast cancer (rs115635831, P=0.018; rs188686860, P=0.012; Table 2).
0	breast cancer	BRCA1	rs115635831	RESULTS	While there were no significant differences in the associations with ER-positive and ER-negative disease among BRCA1 carriers (PHet=0.12), the associations were stronger for ER-negative (rs115635831 HR=1.32, P=3 x 10-3) than ER-positive breast cancer (rs115635831 overall HR=1.21, P=0.018) using the retrospective likelihood model (Supplementary Table 12).
0	breast cancer	BRCA1	NA	RESULTS	In addition, the associations for BRCA1 mutation carriers were of similar magnitude as the OR estimates for ER-negative breast cancer in BCAC-iCOGS (Supplementary Table 15).
0	breast cancer	BRCA1	NA	RESULTS	There was also no evidence of intraclass heterogeneity (P<0.05) between the effect estimates for BRCA1 mutation carriers and ER-negative breast cancer in the general population (BCAC-iCOGS).
0	Colon and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer	BRCA1	rs115635831	RESULTS	A competing risks analysis for BRCA1 mutation carriers found little influence of ovarian cancer on risks of breast cancer (rs115635831 HR=1.23, P=0.016), and no evidence of association with ovarian cancer risk using the retrospective likelihood model (Supplementary Table 13).
0	breast cancer	BRCA2	NA	RESULTS	No association with overall breast cancer risk among BRCA2 mutation carriers (Supplementary Table 10) was evident.
0	breast cancer	NA	rs114962751	RESULTS	Interestingly, rs114962751 at 2q33 and rs150750171 at 6p had the most significant interaction (P=3.9 x 10-4) among all known breast cancer risk SNPs in the iCOGS data, although the interaction was non-significant after adjusting for multiple testing (Supplementary Table 14).
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	RESULTS	Altogether these results suggest the presence of a novel locus associated with ER-negative breast cancer that is located in the CLK1/PPIL3 region proximal to CASP8
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	RESULTS	To identify the genes in the novel loci influenced by the observed associations with ER-negative breast cancer, expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analyses were performed using gene expression data from breast tumour tissue and normal breast tissue and 1000 Genomes Project imputed SNPs in 1 Mb regions around the novel loci.
0	breast cancer	TRMT61B	NA	RESULTS	In the 2p23.2 locus, the strongest cis eQTL associations for 735 TCGA breast tumours (BC765) involved TRMT61B expression (Supplementary Table 17).
1	breast cancer	TRMT61B	rs67073037	RESULTS	Most of the genome-wide significant ER-negative breast cancer risk SNPs in the locus displayed associations with TRMT61B expression, including the imputed SNPs (rs67073037, P=1.47 x 10-5; Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	rs6734079	RESULTS	3; rs6734079, P=1.85 x 10-5) and the genotyped SNP (rs4577254, P=5.61 x 10-5) most significantly associated with risk (Supplementary Table 18).
0	NA	TRMT61B	NA	RESULTS	Similarly, in a Norwegian normal breast cohort of 116 normal breast tissues (NB116), the strongest cis eQTLs associations involved TRMT61B expression and the risk SNPs in the locus yielded significant associations with TRMT61B expression (Supplementary Table 17).
0	breast cancer	NA	rs6419696	RESULTS	While the peak eQTL SNPs (rs6419696, P=1.21 x 10-17) were not among the SNPs showing the greatest association with risk (rs6419696, P=2.6 x 10-3), conditional analyses showed that the rs6419696 eQTL SNP accounted for much of the influence of the rs4577254 SNP on ER-negative breast cancer risk (P=9.07 x 10-4) and vice versa (Supplementary Table 18).
0	breast cancer	TRMT61B	NA	RESULTS	Thus, modulation of TRMT61B expression may contribute in part to the risk of breast cancer in this region.
0	breast cancer	PIBF1	NA	RESULTS	In the 13q22.1 locus, the strongest eQTLs in the 735 TCGA breast tumours (BC765) involved PIBF1 (Supplementary Table 19).
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	RESULTS	However, none of the SNPs strongly associated with breast cancer risk in either of the two independent 13q22 loci showed associations with gene expression (Supplementary Table 19, Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	4).
0	NA	DIS3	rs17181761	RESULTS	In contrast, significant associations with DIS3 expression were observed in the BC241 and NB116 cohorts for many of the genome-wide significant SNPs in the locus represented by rs17181761 (NB116 eQTL P=2.34 x 10-3) (Supplementary Table 19).
0	NA	DIS3	NA	RESULTS	While non-significant after accounting for multiple testing, these observations suggest that future studies should evaluate mechanistic interactions between 13q22.1 SNPs and DIS3 expression.
0	NA	PPIL3	rs188686860	RESULTS	Evaluation of eQTLs in the 2q33 locus for the BC765 cohort found that many of the 157 risk-associated SNPs (Table 2, Supplementary Table 15) had strong associations with PPIL3 expression (rs188686860, P=1.77 x 10-7; rs115635831, P=6.08 x 10-7; Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	5) and little evidence of any associations with other genes in the region (Supplementary Table 20).
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	RESULTS	This is one of the few known breast cancer risk loci where the most significant risk SNPs are strongly associated with local gene expression.
0	NA	PPIL3	NA	RESULTS	PPIL3 is located at the proximal end of the locus, 270 kb upstream of CASP8, further suggesting that the 2q33 risk locus is independent of any influence on CASP8
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	RESULTS	To identify candidate SNPs and genes in the 2p23.2 locus driving ER-negative breast cancer risk, ENCODE chromatin biofeatures were evaluated in primary human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs), MCF7 ER-positive cells and MB-MDA-231 ER-negative cells.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Sixteen of the 79 most significantly associated SNPs (P<3 x 10-7) in the region overlapped with three distinct regulatory regions (Supplementary Figs 6 and 7).
1	breast cancer	WDR43	rs67073037	RESULTS	The most significantly associated ER-negative SNP, rs67073037 (Table 2) was located in intron 1 of WDR43 near the transcription start site in a region containing acetylated H3K27 and trimethylated H3K4 chromatin marks in normal HMECs and MB-MDA-231 ER-negative breast tumour cells, and a DNase hypersensitivity cluster in ER-positive MCF7 cells (Supplementary Figs 6 and 7).
0	NA	NA	rs4407214	RESULTS	The three risk-associated SNPs (rs4407214, rs66604446 and rs66768547) with the most significant RegulomeDB scores (2b), were located in the same chromatin marks in this region in HMEC, MD-MBA-231 and MCF7 cells (http://regulomedb.org).
1	NA	WDR43	rs4577244	RESULTS	In addition, the top genotyped SNP (rs4577244) was located in a monomethylated H3K4 mark adjacent to the core promoter region of WDR43 in HMECs (Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	6).
1	NA	WDR43	rs11677283	RESULTS	Separately rs11677283 and rs35617956 in introns 9 and 10 of WDR43 were located in acetylated H3K27 and H3K9 chromatin marks in a putative regulatory region in HMECs, but not in ER-negative MD-MBA-231 cells
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	RESULTS	Combining the eQTL results with these predictions, we tested four genomic tiles spanning region 1 for enhancer activity in both orientations using a luciferase reporter assay in the CAL51 ER-negative breast cancer line and MCF10A normal mammary epithelial cells (Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	3).
0	NA	NA	rs4407214	RESULTS	The tile containing rs4407214 displayed significant enhancer activity (P<0.0001) in at least one orientation when compared with the negative control in MCF10A and CAL51 (Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	3).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	In addition, the tile carrying the disease-associated G allele showed significantly (P=0.0059) higher activity than the T allele in MCF10A cells (Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	3).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Similarly, the disease-associated G-allele showed significantly (P=0.0059) higher activity than the T-allele in a luciferase-based promoter assay in MCF10A cells (P=0.044) and CAL51 (P=0.0078; Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	8).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Consistent with these allele-specific changes in transcriptional activity different protein complexes in electrophoretic mobility shift assays were observed using CAL51 and MCF10A nuclear extracts (Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	3).
0	breast cancer	TRMT61B	NA	RESULTS	In addition, Pol2 ChIA-PET in MCF7 breast cancer cells revealed an interaction between Region 1 and the promoter of TRMT61B (Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	3), which had the strongest eQTL signal in the locus.
0	NA	NA	rs4407214	RESULTS	These results are consistent with modification of Pol2 binding to this region by rs4407214 in lymphoblastoid cells and suggest the presence of a transcriptional enhancer in the region.
1	NA	WDR43	NA	RESULTS	Separately, the ChIA-PET data further suggest that Region 2 in WDR43 may interact with the promoter of WDR43 (Fig.
