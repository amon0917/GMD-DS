1	chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	CNTN4	rs41526344	ABSTRACT	Two SNPs reached a level of genome-wide significance (P < 5 x 10-8) with DeltaBMI: (i) rs41526344 within the CNTN4 gene, among COPD cases (beta = 0.13, P = 4.3 x 10-8); and (ii) rs4751240 in the gene Dedicator of Cytokinesis 1 (DOCK1) among GI cancer cases (beta = 0.10, P = 1.9 x 10-8).

0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Despite the success of genome-wide association studies (GWASes) at identifying thousands of associations with hundreds of complex diseases and traits,1 there has been no published GWAS investigating a cancer cachexia-related trait.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Although there have been a number of published candidate-gene association studies investigating cancer cachexia-related traits (reviewed in Refs2, 3), candidate-gene association studies are limited to known biology and do not take advantage of the agnostic, hypothesis-free approach of genome scans.
0	Cachexia	NA	NA	INTRO	Thus, the cancer cachexia community would benefit from GWASes in order to discover new genes and pathways involved in the aetiology of cachexia
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Body mass index (BMI) is a highly heritable cross-sectional measure that is frequently employed to monitor changes in body composition in epidemiological studies.
0	obese	NA	NA	INTRO	Over 100 genetic loci have been associated with BMI.4, 5 Changes in BMI (DeltaBMI) have also been shown to be heritable with estimates ranging from 0.14 to 0.86.6, 7 At one end of the BMI spectrum, obesity is a known risk factor for a number of complex diseases.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	At the other end of the spectrum, patients who lose weight are also at increased risk of mortality, which is the impetus for investigating muscle wasting and cachexia.8 Cachexia can be characterized in part as a rapid change in weight, including loss of fat-free muscle, as part of the pathology of an illness.8 Cachexia is often thought of with respect to cancer; however, it occurs in patients suffering from many chronic, complex diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure, AIDS, and cystic fibrosis, among others.8, 9 In fact, the number of COPD patients with cachexia was recently estimated to be 1.4 times higher than the number of cancer patients with cachexia.10 Regardless of the primary complex disease diagnosis, cachexia is associated with poor prognosis and an increased burden on the healthcare system.8, 11

1	chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	CNTN4	rs41526344	RESULTS	More specifically, rs41526344, within the CNTN4 gene, was significantly associated with DeltaBMI among COPD cases (beta = 0.13, P = 4.3 x 10-8).
1	NA	CNTN4	rs4751240	RESULTS	CNTN4 codes for contactin 4, a neuronal network axon-associated cell adhesion molecule implicated in the genetics of neuropsychiatric disorders.21 Further, rs4751240 was significantly associated with DeltaBMI among GI cancer cases (beta = 0.10, P = 1.9 x 10-8) and is located within the Dedicator of Cytokinesis 1 (DOCK1) gene, which codes for the dedicator of cytokinesis 1 protein and has a role in myoblast fusion.22 The DOCK1 SNP, rs4751240, has a minor allele frequency of 7% in the GI cancer population, and under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, we would expect that 0.5% of the population would be homozygous for the variant and 13% would be heterozygous.
1	chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	CNTN4	rs41526344	RESULTS	For the rs41526344 SNP within the CNTN4 gene, we would expect 0.8% of the population to be homozygous and 14.6% to be heterozygous based on the minor allele frequency in the COPD population.

1	cancers	DOCK1	rs4751240	RESULTS	The GWS association observed among the DOCK1 SNP, rs4751240, and DeltaBMI in GI cancer was replicated in the COPD DeltaBMI GWAS (beta COPD: 0.08, P COPD = 0.014, beta meta-analysis: 0.1, P meta-analysis = 9.3 x 10-10; Table S7).
0	cancers	NA	rs4751240	RESULTS	This beta accounts for a mean increase of 0.1 kg/m2 BMI per year in GI cancer cases and of 0.08 kg/m2 BMI per year in COPD cases after taking age, sex, and change in smoking status into account for each copy of the rs4751240 minor allele (Figure 3).
1	NA	DOCK1	rs4751240	RESULTS	The regional association plot (Figure 2B) demonstrates that the genotyped rs4751240 SNP is intronic within the coding region of DOCK1 and is not in LD with other genotyped variants.
0	NA	NA	rs4751240	RESULTS	When HaploReg was used to examine LD of variants with rs4751240 by using the 1000 Genomes Project haplotypes, only one other variant in the region is in high LD with this SNP (Table S8).
1	cancers	NA	rs4751240	RESULTS	The investigation using HaploReg also revealed that rs4751240 alters a motif23 corresponding to the tumour suppressor Nkx2-8.22, 23 We also identified an association in the meta-analysis of DeltaBMI between lung cancer and COPD cases near the FAM73B gene (rs7042889, beta meta-analysis: -0.14, P meta-analysis = 1.4 x 10-7; Table S10).
1	NA	NA	rs7042889	RESULTS	The HaploReg investigation revealed that rs7042889 is in high LD with eight SNPs that alter regulatory motifs, including rs7873667 which alters a number of motifs including several forkhead box (Fox) motifs (Table S10)

0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In summary, we report findings from the first GWAS of a cachexia-related trait, DeltaBMI, among cancer and COPD cases.
1	chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	CNTN4	rs41526344	DISCUSS	We found one SNP, rs41526344, significantly associated with DeltaBMI among COPD cases in the CNTN4 gene but were unable to replicate it.
1	cancers	DOCK1	rs4751240	DISCUSS	The DOCK1 SNP rs4751240 was significantly associated with DeltaBMI among GI cancer cases and replicated among COPD cases.
1	lung cancer	FAM73B	rs7042889	DISCUSS	We also identified a nearly significant association with rs7042889 in the meta-analysis of DeltaBMI between lung cancer and COPD cases near the FAM73B gene
1	cancers	DOCK1	rs4751240	DISCUSS	The rs4751240 SNP in the DOCK1 gene achieved a level of GWS (P < 5 x 10-8) in the analysis of DeltaBMI among GI cancer cases and replicated nominally in the analyses among COPD cases.
0	Deficiency	DOCK1	NA	DISCUSS	DOCK1 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, catalysing the exchange of GDP to GTP to activate Rho proteins.24 In mouse models, knockout of DOCK1 is embryonic lethal with a dramatic reduction of skeletal muscle tissues attributed to a deficiency in myoblast fusion.22 Myoblast fusion is also critical for satellite cell-mediated muscle regeneration in adults.25 As cachexia can be the result of both increased muscle breakdown and decreased muscle production, genetic variation in DOCK1 may influence muscle regeneration.
1	NA	DOCK1	rs4751240	DISCUSS	The DOCK1 SNP, rs4751240, is an intronic variant.
0	cancers	NA	rs4751240	DISCUSS	SNPs in non-coding regions of the genome may directly alter or may be in LD with genetic variants that alter regulatory regions such as transcription factor or enhancer binding sites and in turn have an effect on gene expression and protein abundance.26 The rs4751240 SNP is within a motif for the tumour suppressor Nkx2-8, whose mechanism of tumour suppression is by up-regulating FOXO3a protein encoded by the FOXO3 gene.27 The Fox class O (FoxO) transcription factor family members FOXO1 and FOXO3 are well known to play a role in energy metabolism, protein breakdown, regulation of muscle mass, and adaptation to exercise.28 All FoxOs are activated in response to insulin stimulation and/or oxidative stress by phosphorylation at three evolutionarily conserved sites.28 Interestingly, the top SNP associated with DeltaBMI in the meta-analysis of lung cancer and COPD cases is in high LD with rs7873667 (Table S10) that disrupts several Fox transcription factors, including FoxO.
0	NA	FOXO3	rs9400239	DISCUSS	In a recent mega-GWAS, rs9400239 in FOXO3 was significantly associated with cross-sectional BMI (beta = 0.0019, P = 1.61 x 10-8) in individuals of European ancestry, further supporting the role of this pathway in determining BMI.4
0	cancers	SUCNR1	NA	DISCUSS	The top finding in the meta-analysis of DeltaBMI between all cancer and COPD cases is intergenic to SUCNR1 and MBLN1.
0	DM	NA	NA	DISCUSS	SUCRN1 codes for the succinate receptor 1 gene, which is a G-protein coupled receptor for succinate, an intermediate of the citric acid cycle.29 MBLN1 codes for the muscleblind-like splicing regulator 1, which plays a role in myotonic dystrophy and knockout of the gene in the mouse leads to muscle abnormalities and cataracts.30 This result, however, fails to achieve a level of genome-wide significance.
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The power of the analysis may be limited both by the sample size and heterogeneity of DeltaBMI trajectories among different types of cancer.
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The analyses that were performed among different cancer types further reduced the sample size but may have increased the homogeneity of the DeltaBMI trajectory, thereby increasing the power to detect the significant association in the GI cancer group
1	chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	CNTN4	rs41526344	DISCUSS	We identified one variant, rs41526344, significantly associated with DeltaBMI among COPD cases in the CNTN4 gene, coding for contactin-4.
0	NA	fibronectin	NA	DISCUSS	Contactins are a family of neural immunoglobulin cell adhesion molecules (IgCAMs) with six N-terminal immunoglobulin repeats followed by four fibronectin type III repeats.
0	NA	contactin-1	NA	DISCUSS	The prototypical contactin is contactin-1 with shared amino acid identity ranging from 33 to 52% identity with contactin-4 depending on the domain.21 Genetic variations in CNTN4, CNTN5, and CNTN6 have been associated with autism spectrum disorders.31 Increased signal transduction via the mTOR signal transduction pathway is one mechanism common to many autism spectrum disorder genes including contactins.31 Interestingly, decreased mTOR signalling is observed during fasting and disease as muscle growth and atrophy depends on the mTOR pathway.32 Further, mutations in CNTN1 cause a familial form of the lethal congenital myopathy, a disease whose hallmark is low muscle tone.33 In the current study, we identified a significant association with a CNTN4 SNP with DeltaBMI among COPD cases; however, we were not able to replicate the findings among cancer cases
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	There have been a number of candidate gene association studies investigating the genetics of cancer cachexia-related traits such as low BMI, low FFMI, weight loss, and muscle strength, but no GWAS has been reported to our knowledge.
0	Cachexia	ACE	NA	DISCUSS	Systematic reviews of the genetics of cancer cachexia highlighted genes involved in inflammatory response regulation, homeostasis, pathways directing muscle and fat metabolism, and appetite regulation.2, 3 Among COPD cases, muscle quadricep muscle strength and low FFMI candidate gene studies have reported associations with the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme gene,34 Bradykinin Receptor gene,35 IL1beta,36 IL6,36 TNFalpha,36 and vitamin D receptor.37 Wan and colleagues from our research group38 reported GWASes findings investigating two continuous outcomes, BMI and FFMI, in COPD cases.
0	obese	FTO	NA	DISCUSS	They found several SNPs tagging the fat-mass and obesity (FTO) gene significantly associated (meta-analysis: P < 5 x 10-7) with reduced BMI and FFMI in COPD cases.
0	NA	FTO	NA	DISCUSS	Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the FTO gene have been repeatedly associated with BMI39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44 and diabetes.45 It is interesting to note that we did not find statistically significant associations with any known cachexia candidate genes.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This may indicate that the genetic aetiology of longitudinal BMI is different than cross-sectional BMI; however, larger sample sizes will be required to clarify this issue.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The current report begins to fill the void of reported GWASes investigating cachexia-related traits and provides a foundation for expanding this work to larger case populations with more extensive phenotyping for monitoring cachexia
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In the current report, we took advantage of a publicly available dataset to test the hypothesis that a shared genetic aetiology exists for DeltaBMI among cancer and COPD cases.
1	cancers	DOCK1	NA	DISCUSS	We considered SNPs with P < 5 x 10-8, the generally accepted threshold for statistical significance in GWAS, as statistically significant because it has been shown to account both for the number of variants tested and the LD structure of the genome.19, 20 Further, the Bonferroni adjusted threshold for 418 365 SNPs tested in four GWASes is alpha = 3.0 x 10-8, and the finding with DOCK1 among GI cancer cases is also below this more conservative level of statistical significance (P = 1.9 x 10-8).
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We do acknowledge that the sample sizes became relatively small when we examined individual groups of cancer patients.
1	cancers	DOCK1	rs4751240	DISCUSS	Despite this limitation, the rs4751240 finding in DOCK1 did reach a level of genome-wide significance among GI cancer cases, and we were able to replicate the finding among COPD cases contributing to a meta-analysis of P = 9.3 x 10-10.
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This finding supports the hypothesis that a shared genetic aetiology exists for DeltaBMI among GI cancer and COPD cases and also underscores the need for further investigations into larger cancer and COPD populations to increase the power to detect additional signals.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Further, our investigation was underpowered for additional genetic analyses such as epistasis.
1	Cachexia	DOCK1	NA	DISCUSS	In future investigations, we plan to investigate the role of epistasis in cachexia by, for example, testing for significant genetic interactions between the DOCK1 SNP identified in the current analyses and variants in other candidate genes whose role in cachexia has been implicated
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Further limitations of the analyses include an inability to address the temporal relationship between disease diagnoses and DeltaBMI in our analyses.
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	It is possible, for example, that an individual received a cancer diagnosis many years before the initial BMI time point used to generate the DeltaBMI phenotype in FHS.
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We performed our analyses in a longitudinal, population-based cohort and screened for participants over the age of 40 and only considered the last three consecutive BMI measurements reported among cancer and COPD cases.
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The median age for the first BMI measurement included in the GI cancer analysis was 69 with a median follow-up period of 7 years (Table 1).
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	With the focus on the last three consecutive time points with BMI data available in FHS combined with the advanced age of the population under investigation, the majority of cancer diagnoses would most likely have been made either prior or during the window we investigated DeltaBMI.
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Although timing of diagnosis of cancer relative to DeltaBMI is important, even more important issues are the stage, extent, and treatment of the cancer, including consideration of course of chemotherapy and any resultant toxicity, relative to DeltaBMI.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We plan to pursue these more detailed characterizations in future studies.
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Cancers are likely present for years before diagnoses are made, and the pre-diagnosis duration is typically unknown.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We think that the fact that we have found interesting genetic association results with these limitations argues that there are likely important signals to find
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The current report has many limitations.
0	chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We mined a publically available study, the FHS, to investigate DeltaBMI among COPD and cancer cases.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The FHS participants had BMI measured every 2-4 years.
0	Cachexia	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The ideal study design would ascertain patients for longitudinal assessments of cachexia, including measuring BMI and/or more precise measurements of muscle mass every 3-6 months in addition to other characteristics established in the cachexia consensus definition.8 Further, our sample sizes became small when we restricted analyses to cancer and COPD subsets of the population.
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	As we used a hypothesis-free approach to search for genetic variants associated with DeltaBMI among cancer and COPD cases, replicating the finding in independent populations ascertained for cachexia will be a crucial next step
1	gastrointestinal toxicity	DOCK1	NA	DISCUSS	The current analysis demonstrates evidence for the involvement of the DOCK1 gene with DeltaBMI among both GI cancer and COPD cases.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The current investigation has highlighted genes known for their involvement in energy metabolism and muscle maintenance as associated with DeltaBMI.
0	chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Future directions will include collection and analysis of gene expression data to identify expression biomarkers associated with DeltaBMI among COPD and cancer cases in addition to more information on cancer diagnosis, stage, extent, and treatment.
0	Cachexia	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our future efforts will be directed at analysing additional longitudinal data characterizing both genetic and gene expression to gain further insight on biomarkers that can be used to monitor the development and prognosis of cachexia
