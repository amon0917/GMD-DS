0	Type 2 diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	Type 2 diabetes is a common complex disease characterised by deficient insulin secretion and decreased insulin sensitivity.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	In 2010, 285 million people worldwide were affected by type 2 diabetes, with 60% of them located in Asia.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	China now has the largest number of patients with diabetes in the world, with an estimated 92 million affected individuals, and an additional 150 million with impaired glucose tolerance
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	To identify common type 2 diabetes susceptibility variants, large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been conducted in white individuals, yielding more than 60 genetic loci to date.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Although many of these regions have been successfully replicated in Asian populations, discrepancies in allelic frequencies and effect sizes have demonstrated that interethnic differences exist.
0	NA	KCNQ1	NA	INTRO	GWAS conducted in Japanese individuals, as well as meta-analyses of GWAS in South Asian and East Asian groups, have revealed additional variants not detected in GWAS with white individuals, with several signals, including KCNQ1, later replicated in many populations.

0	pancreatic	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our finding is consistent with other studies that have highlighted the important role of genes implicated in pancreatic development in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.
0	diabetes	HNF4A	NA	DISCUSS	In a previous study, a risk variant at HNF4a has been found to be associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes, and carriers of the risk allele have impaired beta cell function.
1	NA	PAX4	R121W	DISCUSS	The MAF of the R121W PAX4 mutation was 1% in Asians, and the mutation is in low LD with rs10229583.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	It is possible that both rare mutations and common variation within the same gene confer risk towards type 2 diabetes independently.
0	NA	NA	rs10229583	DISCUSS	The common variant we identified, rs10229583, may be associated with altered gene expression, while the other rare non-synonymous mutations lead to impaired gene function.
0	diabetes	MTNR1B	NA	DISCUSS	For example, while common non-coding variants in MTNR1B increase type 2 diabetes risk with a modest effect, large-scale resequencing has identified rare loss-of-function MTNR1B variants that significantly contribute towards type 2 diabetes risk.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Some regulatory elements harbouring type 2 diabetes-associated loci have recently been found to exhibit allele-specific differences in activity, providing evidence supporting the functional role of non-coding common variants identified through GWAS
1	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The recent East Asian meta-analysis comprising eight type 2 diabetes GWAS identified a locus on chromosome 7 near GRIP and GCC1-PAX4 to be associated with type 2 diabetes.
0	NA	GCC1	NA	DISCUSS	The protein encoded by GCC1 may play a role in transmembrane transport.
0	NA	NA	rs6467136	DISCUSS	The variant identified from the East Asian study, rs6467136, appears to be independent of our signal, with r2 = 0.044 in our Chinese samples (ESM Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	8).
0	NA	NA	rs10229583	DISCUSS	Furthermore, we found no change in the effect size of rs10229583 after conditioning on rs6467136 (OR [95% CI] = 1.20 [1.11, 1.29], p = 4.6 x 10-6 vs OR [95% CI] = 1.19 [1.10, 1.29), p = 1.6 x 10-5, before and after the conditional analysis in 9,886 Chinese samples).
0	NA	NA	rs6467136	DISCUSS	Likewise, rs6467136 had little change in effect after conditioning on rs10229583 (OR [95% CI] = 1.09 [1.02, 1.17], p = 0.0125 before; OR [95% CI] = 1.07 [0.99, 1.15], p = 0.0729 after).
0	diabetes	KCNQ1	rs231362	DISCUSS	In the recent analysis from the DIAGRAM Consortium, rs231362 near KCNQ1 was identified to be associated with type 2 diabetes.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This signal is independent of the original signal identified in the Japanese population as revealed by conditional analysis.
0	NA	KCNQ1	NA	DISCUSS	Consistent with the evidence observed for KCNQ1, our finding highlighted that multiple common genetic variations within the same gene region may independently contribute to disease risk.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	It will be worthwhile undertaking a further investigation of this region to search for population-specific and/or disease causal variants in different ethnic groups by fine-mapping as well as transethnic mapping

1	NA	ARF5	NA	DISCUSS	ARF5 belongs to a family of guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that have been shown to play a role in vesicular trafficking and as activators of phospholipase D. Islet expression of ARF5 was found to be induced threefold in rats receiving a high-carbohydrate diet.
1	NA	SND1	NA	DISCUSS	The nearby SND1 gene, also known as the p100 transcription co-activator, is a member of the micronuclease family and plays a key role in transcription and splicing.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The p100 transcriptional co-activator is present in endocrine cells and tissues, including the pancreas of cattle
0	diabetes	KCNQ1	NA	DISCUSS	Among the type 2 diabetes loci first identified in non-European populations, other than KCNQ1, few have consistently been found to show a significant association in studies of individuals of European descent.
0	diabetes	NA	rs10229583	DISCUSS	The diabetes gene variant we identified, rs10229583, also showed a significant association in Europeans in the DIAGRAM Consortium, with a smaller effect size compared with East Asian individuals (p = 0.0024 by Cochran's Q statistics, I2 = 0.8913).
1	NA	PAX4	NA	DISCUSS	Interestingly, rare PAX4 mutations were first identified in Asian MODY probands, but seldom found in those of European descent.
1	diabetes	PAX4	NA	DISCUSS	This suggests that PAX4, like KCNQ1, may be particularly relevant for the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes in East Asians individuals.
1	NA	SND1	rs10229583	DISCUSS	Interestingly, rs10229583 is also in strong LD with a region spanning the neighbouring SND1 gene (Fig.

0	Type 2 diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Further resequencing and transethnic mapping should help to identify the causal gene variant for type 2 diabetes within this region
0	Type 2 diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The novel locus we identified in Chinese individuals with type 2 diabetes has not been detected in previous GWAS performed in mainly individuals of European descent.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We noted a highly significant LD variation between Chinese and European individuals in the region surrounding our identified variant.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	There is also significant variation in allele frequencies in Chinese compared with Europeans, as well as between Chinese and African individuals.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This ethnic difference in LD pattern and risk allele frequency may lead to a differential impact in different populations and warrants further investigation by resequencing
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our study has several limitations.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The sample size of our GWAS was modest, resulting in limited power to identify genetic variants with small effect sizes.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We have limited our discovery study to Southern Han Chinese, although the consistent replication seen in other East Asian population suggests that the findings may be applicable to other populations of Chinese descent
1	diabetes	PAX4	rs10229583	DISCUSS	In summary, we identify rs10229583 near PAX4 as a novel locus for type 2 diabetes in Chinese and other populations, providing new insights into the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes
