1	Alzheimer's disease	apolipoprotein E	NA	ABSTRACT	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) have consistently observed strong evidence of association with polymorphisms in APOE.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	However, until recently, variants at few other loci with statistically significant associations have replicated across studies.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	The present study combines data on 483,399 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from a previously reported GWAS of 492 LOAD cases and 496 controls and from an independent set of 439 LOAD cases and 608 controls to strengthen power to identify novel genetic association signals.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Associations exceeding the experiment-wide significance threshold  were replicated in an additional 1,338 cases and 2,003 controls.
1	NA	apolipoprotein E	rs2075650	ABSTRACT	As expected, these analyses unequivocally confirmed APOE's risk effect (rs2075650, ).
1	NA	MTHFD1L	rs11754661	ABSTRACT	Additionally, the SNP rs11754661 at 151.2 Mb of chromosome 6q25.1 in the gene MTHFD1L (which encodes the methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (NADP+ dependent) 1-like protein) was significantly associated with LOAD (; Bonferroni-corrected P = 0.022).
1	NA	NA	rs11754661	ABSTRACT	Subsequent genotyping of SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium  with rs11754661 identified statistically significant associations in multiple SNPs (rs803424, P = 0.016; rs2073067, P = 0.03; rs2072064, P = 0.035), reducing the likelihood of association due to genotyping error.
1	NA	NA	rs11754661	ABSTRACT	In the replication case-control set, we observed an association of rs11754661 in the same direction as the previous association at P = 0.002 ( in combined analysis of discovery and replication sets), with associations of similar statistical significance at several adjacent SNPs (rs17349743, P = 0.005; rs803422, P = 0.004).
1	NA	MTHFD1L	NA	ABSTRACT	In summary, we observed and replicated a novel statistically significant association in MTHFD1L, a gene involved in the tetrahydrofolate synthesis pathway.
1	NA	MTHFD1L	NA	ABSTRACT	This finding is noteworthy, as MTHFD1L may play a role in the generation of methionine from homocysteine and influence homocysteine-related pathways and as levels of homocysteine are a significant risk factor for LOAD development
1	Alzheimer's disease	apolipoprotein E	NA	ABSTRACT	Studies looking for genetic variants across the genome that affect late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) have had little success identifying genes other than APOE.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Here, we use an expanded set of AD cases and controls to improve our power to detect genetic variants driving LOAD risk.
1	NA	MTHFD1L	rs11754661	ABSTRACT	Analyzing 483,399 genetic variants across the genome in a discovery dataset of 931 cases and 1,104 controls, we found a strong association to the marker rs11754661 on chromosome 6 in the gene MTHFD1L, in addition to the highly replicated chromosome 19 APOE association.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	We genotyped adjacent variants on chromosome 6 in these same cases and controls and found these variants were also associated with LOAD.
1	NA	MTHFD1L	rs11754661	ABSTRACT	We replicated the association with rs11754661 and additional SNPs in MTHFD1L in a combined dataset of cases and controls from our laboratory and from publicly available datasets.

0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Alzheimer disease (AD) [MIM 104300] is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory and cognitive impairment affecting more than 13% of individuals aged 65 years and older and constitutes the most common form of dementia among older adults.
1	Alzheimer's disease	PSEN1	NA	INTRO	While several major genes contributing to risk of Alzheimer Disease have been identified (APP , PS1 , PS2 ), all but one (APOE ) contributed predominantly to early-onset forms of AD that cluster within families; other than APOE, few consistent association signals have been observed for late-onset AD (LOAD).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Recent estimates of the heritability of LOAD fall between 60% and 80%.
1	Alzheimer's disease	apolipoprotein E	NA	INTRO	However, while APOE epsilon4-alleles elevate AD risk, only 50% of AD cases carry an APOE epsilon4 allele, suggesting genetic factors elsewhere in the genome contribute to AD risk
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	At present, eleven studies have tested association with LOAD on genome-wide panels of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).
1	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	INTRO	Most, but not all, of these studies indirectly observed associations with APOE on chromosome 19q with strong experiment-wide statistical significance.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	However, only a few of the studies observed associations at other loci exceeded experiment-wide statistical significance thresholds.

0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Generally, these earlier reports have not been consistently replicated in other studies, possibly due to sample sizes that are substantially smaller than those of GWAS studies that have successfully identified genes for other complex disorders.
0	NA	CLU	NA	INTRO	Two large collaborative GWAS of LOAD examined many thousands of cases and controls and both identified novel association signals in the gene CLU (aka APOJ, MIM: 185430; Apolipoprotein J or Clusterin), as well as signals in CR1 (MIM: 120620, Complement Component Receptor 1) and in PICALM (MIM: 603025, Phosphatidylinositol-Binding Clathrin Assembly Protein), reporting some of the most consistent results for LOAD to date
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Even with the increased sample sizes and improved statistical power to detect loci with moderate effect sizes, it remains unlikely that these studies, incorporating cases and controls from multiple samples with varying case/control inclusion criteria, have identified all loci with modest effect sizes in LOAD.
0	NA	p<10-5	NA	INTRO	We analyzed genome-wide association in a discovery dataset of 931 cases and 1,104 controls and performed replication analysis on the strongest associations (P<10-5) using genotype data from four existing studies totaling 1,338 cases and 2,003 controls

0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	To ensure that this association was not spurious due to differences between subsets of genotyped samples, we performed several post-hoc quality control analyses.
0	NA	p<10-5	NA	RESULTS	We examined clustering plots from genotype calling by platform to determine if misclassification could have affected the associations observed for the top 11 SNPs with P<10-5, and observed discrete clustering by genotype for all 11 SNPs.

1	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	RESULTS	We also examined differences in dataset characteristics including variation in age, sex, and APOE epsilon4 genotype distributions, and found limited differences between subsets by study center, autopsy- or clinical-confirmation of case or control status, and by genotyping platform (Table S5).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Subsequently, we examined the first hundred principal components generated from EIGENSTRAT to determine if any of the principal components were associated with both differences in genotyping platform subset and disease status at P<0.05 as markers of potential systematic bias.
1	NA	NA	rs11754661	RESULTS	While two principal components other than those used to adjust for population substructure showed association with both genotyping platform subset and LOAD, additional adjustment for these principal components did not change the strength of association between rs11754661 and LOAD (data not shown).
1	NA	NA	rs11754661	RESULTS	Models further adjusting for age, sex, and APOE epsilon4 carrier status (+/-) (Table S6) only marginally diminished the effect size and statistical significance of the association of rs11754661 with LOAD (adjustment for age and sex, OR (95% CI): 2.03 (1.56, 2.64), ; adjustment for age, sex and APOE epsilon4 (+/-), OR (95% CI): 2.01 (1.51, 2.67), )

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The Bonferroni-corrected threshold for experiment-wide statistical significance was thus set at Bonferroni-corrected
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	After genotyping, multiple quality controls were performed including assessment of sample efficiency, which is the proportion of valid genotype calls to attempted calls within a sample.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Samples with efficiency less than 0.98 were dropped from the analysis.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Reported gender and genetic gender were examined with the use of X-linked SNPs; 32 inconsistent samples were dropped from the analysis.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Relatedness between samples was tested via the program Graphical Representation of Relatedness (GRR), and 3 related samples were dropped from the analysis
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	To determine if population substructure exists in the case-control sample, a set of 10,000 SNPs with MAF>0.25, selected for minimal between-SNP linkage disequilibrium (r2<0.20), and spread evenly across the autosomal chromosomes were analyzed using the program STRUCTURE (burn in: 5,000, iterations: 25,000) assuming different number of assumed subpopulations (K).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The -log likelihood for K was maximized at K = 3, suggesting population substructure.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Further analysis was performed in EIGENSTRAT, where principal components analysis on the sample of 10,000 SNPs was used to generate principal component loadings for samples and remove outliers by using the top ten principal components over 5 iterations with a threshold of six standard deviations.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The top three principal component loadings were used as covariates to account for population structure in the association analysis
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Removing genotyped individuals with low genotype call rates, incorrect reported gender, high relatedness with other samples, and extreme outliers in substructure analyses, 440 cases and 608 controls remained for inclusion in analysis, and were combined with 492 cases and 496 controls from the previous GWAS
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Quality control was performed to remove any low quality SNPs.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Genotype clusters were redefined using signal intensities of samples with efficiency greater than 0.98, and genotypes were recalled on the basis of these new clusters per the manufacturer's recommendation.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Efficiency of individual SNPs was estimated as the proportion of samples with genotype calls for a given SNP, and SNPs with efficiency less than 0.95 were dropped from analysis.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Due to concerns of low statistical power to detect association, SNPs with MAF<0.005 were dropped from analysis.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Hardy-Weinberg Disequilibrium (HWD) statistics were calculated among controls with the Fisher's exact test in the PLINK software package; SNPs with P<10-6 for HWD were dropped from analysis.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	In addition, due to concerns with the spurious association originating from the use of different genotyping platforms on samples in the previous and current GWAS studies, distributions of genotype frequencies at each SNP in each study were examined among controls using a Fisher's exact test, and SNPs with highly-differing genotype distributions across genotyping subsets (P<0.001) were dropped prior to analysis.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	After these quality control measures, 483,399 SNPs remained for association analysis
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Association analysis was performed using logistic regression to test association of genotypes with LOAD under an additive model.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Logistic regression was used to permit covariate adjustment for loadings taken from the first three principal components identified in EIGENSTRAT to account for population substructure.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Here we report results from logistic regression models adjusting only for population substructure with principal components.
1	NA	p<10-5	NA	METHODS	Further regression modeling was also performed on SNPs with initial associations of P<10-5, extending models to adjust for APOE genotype (designated as the number of epsilon4 alleles), age-at-onset in cases and age-at-exam in controls, and gender as covariates (Table S6).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	All analyses were performed using the PLINK software package
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Quantile-quantile plots of the associations were made (Figure 1), and suggest the absence of systematic bias in the tests of association
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	To provide independent replication of the associations observed in the discovery dataset, genome-wide genotyping data were combined from four additional datasets (one unpublished and three publicly-available datasets) and missing genotype data imputed using IMPUTE v1.0 (Table S8).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	SNPs with differing genotypic distributions between datasets were excluded from imputation using the Fisher's exact test approached described earlier.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Both primary and replication datasets were imputed to a HapMap reference of over 2.5 million SNPs.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Individual genotypes with probability less than 0.90 were not included, and SNPs missing >10% of genotypes within either data set were dropped.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	In addition to using the combined Hapmap Phase III CEPH Utah pedigree (CEU) and Tuscan (TSI) haplotype reference panels for imputation, for imputation within each study, we used genotype data on controls from other datasets to improve imputation accuracy, and Affymetrix 5.0 genotype data on 105 individuals genotyped in an independent Ashkenazi Jewish genotyping panel
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	METHODS	We analyzed existing pooled and imputed datasets of unrelated individuals from several studies: 147 cases and 182 controls from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), 86 cases and 1,200 controls (all unrelated) from the Framingham Study SHARe dataset, and 859 cases and 552 controls from the Reiman et al.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	LOAD GWAS dataset, and a set of 246 LOAD cases and 69 cognitively normal controls previously described and genotyped on the Affymetrix 6.0 genotyping platform on which results have not been previously published
