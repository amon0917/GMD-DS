0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	In search of common risk alleles for prostate cancer that could contribute to high rates of the disease in men of African ancestry, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS), with 1,047,986 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers examined in 3,425 African American prostate cancer cases and 3,290 African American male controls.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	The most significant 17 novel associations in stage 1 were followed-up in 1,844 cases and 3,269 controls of African ancestry.
0	NA	NA	rs7210100	ABSTRACT	We identified a novel risk variant on chromosome 17q21 (rs7210100; odds ratio per allele=1.51; p=3.4x10-13).
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	The frequency of the risk allele is ~5% in men of African descent while it is rare in other populations (<1%).
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Further studies are needed to investigate the biological contribution of this allele to prostate cancer risk.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	These findings emphasize the importance of conducting GWAS in diverse populations
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of prostate cancer have identified more than 30 risk associated variants, which in aggregate are estimated to account for approximately 20% of the familial risk of prostate cancer.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Aside from admixture, and fine-mapping studies which identified multiple independent risk variants at 8q24, and a more recent GWAS among Japanese men which identified five novel loci, discoveries in prostate cancer have come from studies in men of European ancestry.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	However, prostate cancer incidence in men of African ancestry is greater than in non-African populations, with the disparity presumably reflecting both differences in prevalence of environmental risk factors and susceptibility alleles that are shared among men of African descent.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	For example, the risk variants at 8q24, many of which are more common in men of African ancestry, could contribute partly to the greater incidence of prostate cancer in this population, and provide some support for the hypothesis of a genetic contribution underlying racial/ethnic disparities in disease risk
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	We assembled a consortium of prostate cancer studies that included men of African ancestry and conducted a GWAS to search for additional risk loci that may be more common in men of African descent.

0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In comparing, for all SNPs, the observed with the expected distribution of p-values from a 1-df trend test there was evidence of inflation in the test statistic (lambda=1.11).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Principal components analysis highlights the high degree of admixture in this population and the over-inflation diminished following additional adjustment for ancestry (lambda=1.03; Supplementary Figure 1, Online Methods).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The association of four SNPs achieved genome-wide significance in the stage 1 sample with p-values between 5.4x10-9 and 5.7x10-13 (Figure 1).

0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	We selected 17 SNPs (p<2x10-5) located outside of known prostate cancer risk regions to examine in a second stage.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	The associations of these 17 SNPs with prostate cancer risk were not influenced substantially by population stratification in the stage 1 sample, as evaluated by principal components analysis (Supplementary Table 2).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The stage 2 sample included 1,396 cases and 2,383 controls of African ancestry from seven independent studies: six U.S.-based studies and one study in Ghana.

0	NA	NA	rs13116912	INTRO	None of the other SNPs selected in stage 1 were significantly associated with risk in the stage 2 sample (all p-values >0.05); SNP rs13116912 was excluded due to deviating from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium in the majority of stage 2 studies.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The results for all 17 SNPs in stage 1 and stage 2 are presented in Supplementary Table 3
0	NA	NA	rs7210100	INTRO	We further examined the association with rs7210100 in a third stage that included three studies among men of African descent, a study from the U.S (SCORE), a study in Senegal (PROGRES), and a study in Barbados (PCBP).
0	NA	NA	rs7210100	INTRO	SNP rs7210100 was found to be positively associated with risk in all three studies (stage 3: 471 cases and 904 controls; combined OR= 2.07, p=1.5x10-5; Table 1)
0	NA	NA	rs7210100	INTRO	Adjustment for global ancestry or local ancestry (African versus European) in the stage 1 studies did not influence the results for rs7210100 (OR= 1.41 without adjustment for ancestry; OR=1.40 adjusted for global ancestry; OR=1.43 adjusted for global and local ancestry.
0	NA	NA	rs7210100	INTRO	The effect estimate for rs7210100 was also similar in men with <15% global European ancestry (1,251 cases and 1,325 controls; OR=1.41) as well as in cases and controls estimated to have 2 chromosomes of African ancestry at this location (2,214 cases and 2,080 controls; OR=1.47).

0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Results for all SNPs examined in the replication stages were also unaffected when adjusting for European ancestry in studies in which information on global ancestry was available (Supplementary Tables 4 and 5)
0	NA	NA	rs7210100	INTRO	In combining the results across all three stages (5,262 cases and 6,554 controls), rs7210100 was strongly and significantly associated with risk (OR = 1.51; 95% CI, 1.35-1.69; p=3.4x10-13).

0	NA	NA	rs7210100	INTRO	However, the association with rs7210100 was greater for non-advanced disease when classified based on stage and grade (Gleason Score <8 and localized stage, 2,433 cases and 6,554 controls: OR=1.67, p=8.6x10-12) than for advanced disease (Gleason Score >=8 or non-localized disease, 1,719 cases and 6,554 controls: OR=1.27, P=5.0x10-3: phet = 6.0x10-3)
0	NA	PSA	rs7210100	INTRO	Among controls with PSA levels measured and <=4 ng/ml (n=2,383) we found no significant association between PSA levels and rs7210100 genotype (p=0.58).
0	Breast and prostate cancer	PSA	rs7210100	INTRO	Limiting the analysis to controls with PSA levels (<4 ng/ml) and cases from these studies did not change the association between rs7210100 and prostate cancer risk (n=3,157 cases and 2,383 controls; OR=1.62, p=4.5x10-8)
1	NA	ZNF652	rs7210100	INTRO	The variant rs7210100 is located in intron 1 of the ZNF652 gene on chromosome 17q21.32.
1	NA	ZNF652	NA	INTRO	ZNF652 encodes a zinc-finger protein transcription factor that has been shown to interact with the Eight-Twenty-One (ETO) protein, CBFA2T3, which acts as a transcriptional repressor by forming complexes with corepressor proteins and HDACs.
1	Breast and prostate cancer	ZNF652	NA	INTRO	Co-expression of ZNF652 and the androgen receptor in prostate tumors has been associated with a decrease in relapse-free survival.
1	NA	ZNF652	NA	INTRO	A common variant just upstream of the ZNF652 gene has also been associated with blood pressure in a GWAS of men and women of European ancestry.
1	NA	ZNF652	rs7210100	INTRO	Sequencing of the 5 coding exons of ZNF652 in 48 subjects (with over-sampling of risk allele carriers; Online Methods) did not reveal a coding variant strongly correlated with rs7210100.
0	NA	NA	rs7210100	INTRO	Further work is needed to map this locus in order to nominate optimal candidate markers, in addition to rs7210100, for functional studies in pursuit of regulatory effects of one or more variants in the region
0	NA	NA	rs7210100	INTRO	The risk allele of rs7210100 is relatively uncommon in men of African ancestry (4-7%), and is extremely rare (<1%) in non-African populations as reported by the 1000 Genomes Project.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The frequency of the risk allele in men of West African ancestry (Ghana and Senegal) is very similar to that observed in African Americans as well as men from East Africa (Uganda, n=111; RAF=0.04).
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	GWAS in populations of European ancestry have not pointed to this region of 17q21 as a risk locus for prostate cancer (Supplemental Figure 3).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Together these observations suggest that the underlying biologically relevant allele may be limited to populations of African descent.
0	cancers	NA	NA	INTRO	As reported by the National Cancer Institute's, Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program, prostate cancer incidence in African American men is 1.56-times higher than the incidence of non-Hispanic Whites.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Since approximately 10% of African American men carry this variant that increases their risk 1.50-fold over non-carriers, we estimate that this locus may be responsible for as much as 9% (95% CI, 6-12%) of the greater incidence of prostate cancer to African American men (Online Methods)
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	In summary, we detected a marker of risk for prostate cancer that appears specific to men of African descent, who have an increased incidence and mortality of this disease.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	These findings provide strong support for conducting GWAS in diverse populations to identify markers of risk that may be population-specific and which could contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in disease incidence.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Further work is needed to characterize the 17q21 region and conduct the functional studies required to understand the role of this germ-line variation in prostate cancer susceptibility
