0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), the most prevalent dementia, is partially driven by genetics.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	To identify LOAD risk loci, we performed a large genome-wide association meta-analysis of clinically diagnosed LOAD (94,437 individuals).
1	Alzheimer's disease	IQCK	NA	ABSTRACT	We confirm 20 previous LOAD risk loci and identify five new genome-wide loci (IQCK, ACE, ADAM10, ADAMTS1, and WWOX), two of which (ADAM10, ACE) were identified in a recent genome-wide association (GWAS)-by-familial-proxy of Alzheimer's or dementia.
0	NA	DQB1	NA	ABSTRACT	Fine-mapping of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region confirms the neurological and immune-mediated disease haplotype HLA-DR15 as a risk factor for LOAD.
0	Alzheimer's disease	tau	NA	ABSTRACT	Pathway analysis implicates immunity, lipid metabolism, tau binding proteins, and amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism, showing that genetic variants affecting APP and Abeta processing are associated not only with early-onset autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease but also with LOAD.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Analyses of risk genes and pathways show enrichment for rare variants (P = 1.32 x 10-7), indicating that additional rare variants remain to be identified.
0	dementia	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	We also identify important genetic correlations between LOAD and traits such as family history of dementia and education
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	INTRO	Our previous work identified 19 genome-wide-significant common variant signals in addition to APOE that influence risk for LOAD (onset age > 65 years).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	These signals, combined with 'subthreshold' common variant associations, account for ~31% of the genetic variance of LOAD, leaving the majority of genetic risk uncharacterized.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	To search for additional signals, we conducted a GWAS meta-analysis of non-Hispanic Whites (NHW) by using a larger Stage 1 discovery sample (17 new, 46 total datasets; n = 21,982 cases, 41,944 cognitively normal controls) from our group, the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) (composed of four consortia: Alzheimer Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC), Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology Consortium (CHARGE), The European Alzheimer's Disease Initiative (EADI), and Genetic and Environmental Risk in AD/Defining Genetic, Polygenic and Environmental Risk for Alzheimer's Disease Consortium (GERAD/ PERADES) (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2, and Supplementary Note).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	To sample both common and rare variants (minor allele frequency (MAF) >= 0.01 and MAF < 0.01, respectively), we imputed the discovery datasets by using a 1,000 Genomes reference panel consisting of 36,648,992 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 1,380,736 insertions/deletions, and 13,805 structural variants.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	After quality control, 9,456,058 common variants and 2,024,574 rare variants were selected for analysis.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Genotype dosages were analyzed within each dataset, and then combined with meta-analysis (Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	1 and Supplementary Tables 1-3)
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The Stage 1 discovery meta-analysis produced 12 loci with genome-wide significance (P <= 5 x 10-8) (Table 1), all of which are previously described.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Genomic inflation factors (lambda) were slightly inflated (lambda median = 1.05; lambda regression = 1.09; see Supplementary Figure 2 for a quantile-quantile (QQ) plot); however, univariate linkage disequilibrium score (LDSC) regression estimates indicated that the majority of this inflation was due to a polygenic signal, with the intercept being close to 1 (1.026, s.e.m.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	= 0.006).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The observed heritability (h2) of LOAD was estimated at 0.071 (0.011) using LDSC.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Stage 1 meta-analysis was first followed by Stage 2, using the I-select chip we previously developed in Lambert et al.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	(including 11,632 variants, n = 18,845; Supplementary Table 4) and finally Stage 3A (n = 11,666) or Stage 3B (n = 30,511) (for variants in regions not well captured in the I-select chip) (see Supplementary Figure 1 for the workflow).
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	The final sample was 35,274 clinical and autopsy-documented Alzheimer's disease cases and 59,163 controls
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Meta-analysis of Stages 1 and 2 produced 21 genome-wide-significant associations (P <= 5 x 10-8) (Table 1 and Fig.
1	Alzheimer's disease	TREM2	R47H	RESULTS	1), 18 of which were previously reported as genome-wide significant in Lambert et al.. Three other signals were not initially described in the initial IGAP GWAS: the rare R47H TREM2 coding variant previously reported by others; ECHDC3 (rs7920721; NC_000010.10: g.11720308A>G), which was recently identified as a potential genome-wide-significant Alzheimer's disease risk locus in several studies, and ACE (rs138190086; NC_000017.10: g.61538148G>A) (Supplementary Figs.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	3 and 4).
1	NA	ADAM10	NA	RESULTS	In addition, seven signals showed suggestive association with P < 5 x 10-7 (closest genes: ADAM10, ADAMTS1, ADAMTS20, IQCK, MIR142/ TSPOAP1-AS1, NDUFAF6, and SPPL2A) (Supplementary Figs.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	5-11).
0	NA	TREM2	NA	RESULTS	Stage 3A and meta-analysis of all three stages for these nine signals (excluding the TREM2 signal; see Supplementary Table 5 for the variant list) identified five genome-wide-significant loci.
1	Alzheimer's disease	ECHDC3	NA	RESULTS	In addition to ECHDC3, this included four new genome-wide Alzheimer's disease risk signals at IQCK, ADAMTS1, ACE, and ADAM10 (Table 2).
1	Alzheimer's disease	ACE	NA	RESULTS	ACE and ADAM10 were previously reported as Alzheimer's disease candidate genes but were not replicated in some subsequent studies.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	A recent GWAS using family history of Alzheimer's disease or dementia as a proxy also identified these two risk loci, suggesting that while use of proxy Alzheimer's disease/dementia cases introduces less sensitivity and specificity for true Alzheimer's disease signals overall in comparison to clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease, proxy studies can identify disease-relevant associations.
1	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Two of the four other signals approached genome-wide significance: miR142/TSPOAP1-AS1 (P = 5.3 x 10-8) and NDUFAF6 (P = 9.2 x 10-8) (Table 2).
0	NA	NME8	NA	RESULTS	Stage 3A also extended the analysis of two loci (NME8 and MEF2C) that were previously genome-wide significant in our 2013 meta-analysis.
0	NA	NME8	NA	RESULTS	These loci were not genome-wide significant in our current study and will deserve further investigation (NME8: P = 2.7 x 10-7; MEF2C: P = 9.1 x 10-8; Supplementary Figs.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	12 and 13).
0	NA	TREM2	NA	RESULTS	Of note, GCTA COJO conditional analysis of the genome-wide loci indicates that TREM2 and three other loci (BIN1, ABCA7, and PTK2B/CLU) have multiple independent LOAD association signals (Supplementary Table 6), suggesting that the genetic variance associated with some GWAS loci is probably underestimated
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We also selected 33 variants from Stage 1 (28 common and 5 rare variants in loci not well captured in the I-select chip; see Methods for full selection criteria) for genotyping in Stage 3B (including populations of Stage 2 and Stage 3A).
1	NA	SUCLG2P4	rs71618613	RESULTS	We nominally replicated a rare variant (rs71618613; NC_000005.9: g.29005985A>C) within an intergenic region near SUCLG2P4 (MAF = 0.01; P = 6.8 x 10-3; combined P = 3.3 x 10-7) and replicated a low-frequency variant in the TREM2 region (rs114812713; NC_000006.11: g.41034000G>C, MAF = 0.03, P = 7.2 x 10-3; combined P = 2.1 x 10-13) in the gene OARD1 that may represent an independent signal according to our conditional analysis (Table 2, Supplementary Figs.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	14 and 15, Supplementary Tables 6 and 7).
1	NA	WWOX	rs62039712	RESULTS	In addition, rs62039712 (NC_000016.9: g.79355857G>A) in the WWOX locus reached genome-wide significance (P = 3.7 x 10-8), and rs35868327 (NC_000005.9: g.52665230T>A) in the FST locus reached suggestive significance (P = 2.6 x 10-7) (Table 2 and Supplementary Figs.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	16 and 17).
1	Alzheimer's disease	WWOX	NA	RESULTS	WWOX may play a role in Alzheimer's disease through its interaction with tau, and it is worth noting that the sentinel variant (defined as the variant with the lowest P value) is just 2.4 mega-bases from PLCG2, which contains a rare variant that we recently associated with Alzheimer's disease.
1	NA	NA	rs62039712	RESULTS	Since both rs62039712 and rs35868327 were only analyzed in a restricted number of samples, these loci deserve further attention
1	Alzheimer's disease	IQCK	NA	RESULTS	To evaluate the biological significance and attempt to identify the underlying risk genes for the newly identified genome-wide signals (IQCK, ACE, ADAM10, ADAMTS1, and WWOX) and those found previously, we pursued five strategies: (1) annotation and gene-based testing for deleterious coding, loss-of-function (LOF) and splicing variants; (2) expression-quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses; (3) evaluation of transcriptomic expression in LOAD clinical traits (correlation with the BRAAK stage and differential expression in Alzheimer's disease versus control brains); (4) evaluation of transcriptomic expression in Alzheimer's disease-relevant tissues; and (5) gene cluster/pathway analyses.
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	RESULTS	For the 24 signals reported here, other evidence indicates that APOE, ABCA7 (refs.

0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	are the true Alzheimer's disease risk gene, although there is a possibility that multiple risk genes exist in these regions.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	Because many GWAS loci are intergenic, and the closest gene to the sentinel variant may not be the actual risk gene, in these analyses we considered all protein-coding genes within +-500 kilobases (kb) of the sentinel variant linkage disequilibrium (LD) regions (r2 >= 0.5) for each locus as a candidate Alzheimer's disease gene (n = 400 genes) (Supplementary Table 8)
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We first annotated all sentinel variants for each locus and variants in LD (r2 > 0.7) with these variants in a search for deleterious coding, LOF or splicing variants.
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	RESULTS	In line with findings that most causal variants for complex disease are non-coding, only 2% of 1,073 variants across the 24 loci (excluding APOE) were exonic variants, with a majority (58%) being intronic (Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	18 and Supplementary Table 9).
1	NA	TREM2	R47H	RESULTS	Potentially deleterious variants include the rare R47H missense variant in TREM2, common missense variants in CR1, SPI1, MS4A2, and IQCK, and a relatively common (MAF = 0.16) splicing variant in IQCK.
0	CHARGE	ABCA7	NA	RESULTS	Using results of a large whole-exome-sequencing study conducted in the ADGC and CHARGE sample (n = 5,740 LOAD cases and 5,096 controls), we also identified ten genes located in our genome-wide loci as having rare deleterious coding, splicing or LOF burden associations with LOAD (false discovery rate (FDR) P < 0.01), including previously implicated rare-variant signals in ABCA7, TREM2, and SORL1 (refs.
1	NA	TREML4	NA	RESULTS	), and additional associations with TREML4 in the TREM2 locus, TAP2 and PSMB8 in the HLA-DRB1 locus, PIP in the EPHA1 locus, STYX in the FERMT2 locus, RIN3 in the SLC24A4 locus, and KCNH6 in the ACE locus (Supplementary Table 10)
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	For eQTL analyses, we searched existing eQTL databases and studies for cis-acting eQTLs in a prioritized set of variants (n = 1,873) with suggestive significance or in LD with the sentinel variant in each locus.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Of these variants, 71-99% have regulatory potential when considering all tissues according to RegulomeDB and HaploReg, but restricting to Alzheimer's disease-relevant tissues (via Ensembl Regulatory Build and GWAS4D) appears to aid in regulatory variant prioritization, with probabilities for functional variants increasing substantially when using GWAS4D cell-dependent analyses with brain or monocytes, for instance (these and other annotations are provided in Supplementary Table 11).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Focusing specifically on eQTLs, we found overlapping cis-acting eQTLs for 153 of the 400 protein-coding genes, with 136 eQTL-controlled genes in Alzheimer's disease-relevant tissues (that is, brain and blood/immune cell types; see Methods for details) (Supplementary Tables 12 and 13).
1	NA	ADAM10	NA	RESULTS	For our newly identified loci, there were significant eQTLs in Alzheimer's disease-relevant tissue for ADAM10, FAM63B, and SLTM (in the ADAM10 locus); ADAMTS1 (ADAMTS1 locus); and ACSM1, ANKS4B, C16orf62, GDE1, GPRC5B, IQCK, and KNOP1 (IQCK locus).
1	NA	WWOX	NA	RESULTS	There were no eQTLs in Alzheimer's disease-relevant tissues in the WWOX or ACE locus, although several eQTLs for PSMC5 in coronary artery tissue were found for the ACE locus.
0	NA	BIN1	NA	RESULTS	eQTLs for genes in previously identified loci include BIN1 (BIN1 locus), INPP5D (INPP5D locus), CD2AP (CD2AP locus), and SLC24A4 (SLC24A4 locus).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Co-localization analysis confirmed evidence of a shared causal variant affecting expression and disease risk in 66 genes over 20 loci, including 31 genes over 13 loci in LOAD-relevant tissue (see Supplementary Table 14 and 15 for complete lists).
1	NA	CR1	NA	RESULTS	Genes implicated include CR1 (CR1 locus), ABCA7 (ABCA7 loci), BIN1 (BIN1 locus), SPI1 and MYBPC3 (SPI1 locus), MS4A2, MS4A6A, and MS4A4A (MS4A2 locus), KNOP1 (IQCK locus), and HLA-DRB1 (HLA-DRB1 locus) (Supplementary Table 12)
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	To study the differential expression of genes in brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease versus controls, we used 13 expression studies.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We found that 58% of the 400 protein-coding genes within the genome-wide loci had evidence of differential expression in at least one study (Supplementary Table 16).
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	Additional comparisons to Alzheimer's disease related gene expression sets revealed that 62 genes were correlated with pathogenic stage (BRAAK) in at least one brain tissue (44 genes in prefrontal cortex, the most relevant LOAD tissue; 36 in cerebellum and 1 in visual cortex).
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	Finally, 38 genes were present in a set of 1,054 genes preferentially expressed in aged microglial cells, a gene set shown to be enriched for Alzheimer's disease genes (P = 4.1 x 10-5).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We also annotated our list of genes with brain RNA-seq data, which showed that 80% were expressed in at least one type of brain cell, and the genes were most highly expressed in fetal astrocytes (26%), followed by microglia/ macrophages (15.8%), neurons (14.8%), astrocytes (11.5%), and oligodendrocytes (6.5%).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	When not considering fetal astrocytes, mature astrocytes (21%), and microglial cells (20.3%), the resident macrophage cells of the brain thought to play a key role in the pathologic immune response in LOAD, became the highest expressed cell types in the genome-wide set of genes, with 5.3% of the 400 genes showing high microglial expression (Supplementary Table 17; see Supplementary Table 18 for the highly expressed gene list by cell type)
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We conducted pathway analyses (MAGMA) separately for common (MAF > 0.01) and rare variants (MAF < 0.01).
0	NA	beta-amyloid (Abeta)	NA	RESULTS	For common variants, we detected four function clusters including (1) APP metabolism/Abeta formation (regulation of Abeta formation: P = 4.56 x 10-7 and regulation of APP catabolic process: P = 3.54 x 10-6); (2) tau protein binding (P = 3.19 x 10-5); (3) lipid metabolism (four pathways including protein-lipid complex assembly: P = 1.45 x 10-7); and (4) immune response (P = 6.32 x 10-5) (Table 3 and Supplementary Table 19).
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	RESULTS	Enrichment of the four clusters remained after removal of genes in the APOE region.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	When APOE-region genes and genes near genome-wide-significant genes were removed, tau showed moderate association (P = 0.027), and lipid metabolism and immune-related pathways showed strong associations (P < 0.001) (Supplementary Table 20).
0	Parkinson	SNCA	NA	RESULTS	Genes driving these enrichments (that is, having a gene-wide P < 0.05) included SCNA, a Parkinson's risk gene that encodes alpha-synuclein, the main component of Lewy bodies, whch may play a role in tauopathies, for the tau pathway; apolipoprotein genes (APOM, APOA5) and ABCA1, a major regulator of cellular cholesterol, for the lipid metabolism pathways; and 52 immune pathway genes (Supplementary Table 21).
0	NA	beta-amyloid (Abeta)	NA	RESULTS	While no pathways were significantly enriched for rare variants, lipid and Abeta pathways did reach nominal significance in rare-variant-only analyses.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	Importantly, we also observed a highly significant correlation between common and rare pathway gene results (P = 1.32 x 10-7), suggesting that risk Alzheimer's disease genes and pathways are enriched for rare variants.
0	NA	tau	NA	RESULTS	In fact, 50 different genes within tau, lipid, immunity and Abeta pathways showed nominal rare-variant driven associations (P < 0.05) with LOAD
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	To further explore the APP/Abeta pathway enrichment, we analyzed a comprehensive set of 335 APP metabolism genes curated from the literature.
1	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	RESULTS	We observed significant enrichment of this gene set in common variants (P = 2.27 x 10-4; P = 3.19 x 10-4 excluding APOE), with both ADAM10 and ACE nominally significant drivers of this result (Table 4 and Supplementary Tables 22 and 23).
0	NA	beta-amyloid (Abeta)	NA	RESULTS	Several 'sub-pathways' were also significantly enriched in the common variants, including 'clearance and degradation of Abeta', and 'aggregation of Abeta', along with its subcategory 'microglia', the latter supporting microglial cells suspected role in response to Abeta in LOAD.
0	NA	beta-amyloid (Abeta)	NA	RESULTS	Nominal enrichment for risk from rare variants was found for the pathway 'aggregation of Abeta: chaperone' and 23 of the 335 genes
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	To identify candidate genes for our novel loci, we combined results from our five prioritization strategies in a priority ranking method similar to that of Fritsche et al.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	(Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	2 and Supplementary Table 24).
1	NA	ADAM10	NA	RESULTS	ADAM10 was the top ranked gene of the 11 genes within the ADAM10 locus.
1	NA	ADAM10	NA	RESULTS	ADAM10, the most important alpha-secretase in the brain, is a component of the non-amyloidogenic pathway of APP metabolism and sheds TREM2 (ref.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	), an innate immunity receptor expressed selectively in microglia.
0	NA	ADAM10	NA	RESULTS	Overexpression of ADAM10 in mouse models can halt Abeta production and subsequent aggregation.
0	NA	ADAM10	NA	RESULTS	In addition, two rare ADAM10 alterations segregating with disease in LOAD families increased Abeta plaque load in 'Alzheimer-like' mice, with diminished alpha-secretase activity from the alterations probably the causal mechanism.
1	obese	IQCK	NA	RESULTS	For the IQCK signal, which is also an obesity locus, IQCK, a relatively uncharacterized gene, was ranked top, although four of the other 11 genes in the locus have a priority rank >= 4, including KNOP1 and GPRC5B, the latter being a regulator of neurogenesis and inflammatory signaling in obesity.
1	NA	ACE	NA	RESULTS	Of the 22 genes in the ACE locus, PSMC5, a key regulator of major histocompatibility complex (MHC), has a top score of 4, while DDX42, MAP3K3, an important regulator of macrophages and innate immunity, and CD79B, a B lymphocyte antigen receptor subunit, each have a score of 3.
1	Alzheimer's disease	ACE	NA	RESULTS	Candidate gene studies have associated ACE variants with Alzheimer's disease risk, including a strong association in the Wadi Ara, an Israeli Arab community with high risk of Alzheimer's disease.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	However, these studies yielded inconsistent results, and our work reports a clear genome-wide association in NHW at this locus.
1	Alzheimer's disease	ACE	NA	RESULTS	While ACE was not prioritized, it should not be rejected as a candidate gene, as its expression in Alzheimer's disease brain tissue is associated with Abeta load and Alzheimer's disease severity.
1	toxicity	ACE	NA	RESULTS	Furthermore, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) are associated with Abeta levels and LOAD risk, and studies show ACE can inhibit Abeta toxicity and aggregation.
1	Alzheimer's disease	AGT	NA	RESULTS	Finally, angiotensin II, a product of ACE function, mediates a number of neuropathological processes in Alzheimer's disease and is now a target for intervention in phase II clinical trials of Alzheimer's disease.
1	NA	ADAMTS1	NA	RESULTS	Another novel genome-wide locus reported here, ADAMTS1, is within 665 kb of APP on chromosome 21.
1	NA	ADAMTS1	NA	RESULTS	Of three genes at this locus, our analyses nominate ADAMTS1 as the likely risk gene, although we cannot rule out that this signal is a regulatory element for APP.
1	neurodegenerative disease	ADAMTS1	NA	RESULTS	ADAMTS1 is elevated in Down's syndrome with neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's disease, and it is a potential neuroprotective gene or a neuroinflammatory gene important to microglial response.
1	obese	WWOX	NA	RESULTS	Finally, WWOX and MAF, which surround an intergenic signal in an obesity associated locus, were both prioritized for the WWOX locus, with MAF, another important regulator of macrophages, being highly expressed in microglia in the Brain RNA-seq database, and WWOX, a high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride-associated gene, being expressed most highly in astrocytes and neurons.
1	familial aggregation	WWOX	NA	RESULTS	WWOX has been implicated in several neurological phenotypes; in addition, it binds tau and may play a critical role in regulating tau hyper-phosphorylation, neurofibrillary formation and Abeta aggregation.
0	memory impairment	NA	NA	RESULTS	Intriguingly, treatment of mice with its binding partner restores memory deficits, hinting at its potential in neurotherapy
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	For previously reported loci, applying the same prioritization approach highlights several genes, as described in Fig.
0	toxicity	FERMT2	NA	RESULTS	2, some of which are involved in APP metabolism (FERMT2, PICALM) or tau toxicity (BIN1, CD2AP, FERMT2, CASS4, PTK2B).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Pathway, tissue and disease trait enrichment analyses support the utility of our prioritization method, as the 53 prioritized genes with a score >= 5 are (1) enriched in substantially more Alzheimer's disease-relevant pathways, processes and dementia-related traits; (2) enriched in candidate Alzheimer's disease cell types such as monocytes (adjusted P = 9.0 x 10-6) and macrophages (adjusted P = 5.6 x 10-3); and (3) more strongly associated with dementia-related traits and Alzheimer's disease-relevant pathways (Supplementary Table 25 and 26; see Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	19 for the interaction network of these prioritized genes).
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	To further investigate the cell types and tissues the prioritized genes are expressed in, we performed differentially expressed gene (DEG) set enrichment analysis of the prioritized genes by using GTEx tissues, and we identified significant differential expression in several potentially relevant Alzheimer's disease tissues including immune-related tissues (upregulation in blood and spleen), obesity-related tissue (upregulation in adipose), heart tissues (upregulation in left ventricle and atrial appendage), and brain tissues (dowregulation in cortex, cerebellum, hippo-campus, basal ganglia, and amygdala).
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	Furthermore, the 53 genes are overexpressed in 'adolescence' and 'young adult' brain tissues in BrainSpan, a transcriptomic atlas of the developing human brain, which is consistent with accumulating evidence suggesting Alzheimer's disease may start decades before the onset of disease (Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	20; see Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	21 for a tissue expression heat map for the 53 genes)
0	NA	HLA	NA	RESULTS	The above approach prioritized HLA-DRB1 as the top candidate gene in the MHC locus, known for its complex genetic organization and highly polymorphic nature (see Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	22 for a plot of the region of the Stage 1 results).
0	Alzheimer's disease	DQB1	NA	RESULTS	Previous analyses in the ADGC (5,728 Alzheimer's disease cases and 5,653 controls) have linked both HLA class I and II haplotypes with Alzheimer's disease risk.
0	NA	DQB1	NA	RESULTS	In order to further investigate this locus in a much larger sample, we used a robust imputation method and fine-mapping association analysis of alleles and haplotypes of HLA class I and II genes in 14,776 cases and 23,047 controls from our datasets (Supplementary Table 27).
0	NA	DQA1	NA	RESULTS	We found risk effects of HLA-DQA1*01:02 (FDR P = 0.014), HLA-DRB1*15:01 (FDR P = 0.083), and HLA-DQB1*06:02 (FDR P = 0.010) (Supplementary Table 28).
0	NA	NA	rs78738018	RESULTS	After conditioning on the sentinel meta-analysis variant in this region (rs78738018), association signals were lost for the three alleles, suggesting that the signal observed at the variant level is due to the association of these three alleles.
0	Alzheimer's disease	DQA1	NA	RESULTS	These alleles form the HLA-DQA1*01:02~HLA-DQB1*06:02~HLA-DRB1*15:01 (DR15) haplotype, which is also associated with Alzheimer's disease in our sample (FDR P = 0.013) (Supplementary Table 29).
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	Taken together, these results suggest a central role of the DR15 haplotype in Alzheimer's disease risk, a finding originally discovered in a small study in the Tunisian population and more recently in a large ADGC analysis.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	RESULTS	Intriguingly, the DR15 haplotype and its component alleles also associate with protection against diabetes, a high risk for multiple sclerosis, and risk or protective effects with many other immune-mediated diseases (Supplementary Table 30).
0	neurologic disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	Moreover, the associated diseases include a large number of traits queried from an HLA-specific Phewas, including neurological diseases (for example, Parkinson's disease) and diseases with risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (for example, hyperthyroidism), pointing to potential shared and/or interacting mechanisms and co-morbidities, a common paradigm in the MHC locus.
0	Alzheimer's disease	DQA1	NA	RESULTS	Two additional alleles, HLA-DQA1*03:01 and HLA-DQB1*03:02, belonging to another haplotype, show a protective effect on Alzheimer's disease, but their signal was lost after conditioning on HLA-DQA1*01:02, and the HLA-DQA1*03:01~HLA-DQB1*03:02 haplotype is not associated with Alzheimer's disease (FDR P = 0.651)
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	As described above, several of our genome-wide loci have potentially interesting co-morbid or pleiotropic associations with traits that may be relevant to the pathology of Alzheimer's disease.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	To investigate the extent of LOAD's shared genetic architecture with other traits, we performed LD-score regression to estimate the genetic correlation between LOAD and 792 human diseases, traits and behaviors (Supplementary Table 31).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The common variant genetic architecture of LOAD was positively correlated with a maternal family history of Alzheimer's disease/dementia (rg for the genetic correlation of two traits = 0.81; FDR P = 2.79 x 10-7), similar to the Marioni et al.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	family proxy analyses, which found maternal genetic correlation with Alzheimer's disease to be higher than that for paternal Alzheimer's disease (rg = 0.91 and 0.66, respectively).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	There is substantial overlap between these estimates, as the Marioni et al.
0	dementia	NA	NA	RESULTS	analyses include the 2013 IGAP summary statistics and employed the same UK Biobank variable that we used for rg estimates with maternal history of dementia.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	We also find significant negative correlation between Alzheimer's disease and multiple measures of educational attainment (for example, college completion, rg = -0.24; years of schooling, rg range = -0.19 to -0.24; cognitive scores, rg = -0.24 and -0.25) (FDR P < 0.05), supporting the theory that a greater cognitive reserve could help protect against development of LOAD.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	The extent to which socioeconomic, environmental, or cultural factors contribute to the correlation between educational attainment and risk for Alzheimer's disease is unknown, but research shows dementia risk to be associated with lower socio-economic status, independently of education status.
0	cardiac dysfunctions	insulin	NA	RESULTS	We also found negative correlations at P < 0.05 with multiple measures of cardiovascular health (that is, family history of high blood pressure and heart disease and vascular/heart problems) and diabetes (that is, fasting proinsulin, basal metabolic rate and fasting insulin), supporting previous research suggesting that use of blood pressure and diabetic medications may reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	In fact, use of blood pressure medication does show a negative genetic correlation with Alzheimer's disease in our study (rg = -0.12; P = 0.035), although this result does not survive FDR correction.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	These and other top results from this analysis (for example, body mass index, height; see Supplementary Table 31 for a full list of other nominally significant correlations) have been linked to Alzheimer's disease previously, either through suggestive or significant genetic or epidemiological associations (see Kuzma et al.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	for a recent review), but the multiple measures here support and emphasize their genetic correlation with LOAD and highlight the possible genetic pleiotropy or co-morbidity of these traits with pathology of LOAD
0	NA	TREM2	NA	DISCUSS	In conclusion, our work identifies five new genome-wide associations for LOAD and shows that GWAS data combined with high-quality imputation panels can reveal rare disease risk variants (for example, TREM2).
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The enrichment of rare variants in pathways associated with Alzheimer's disease indicates that additional rare variants remain to be identified, and larger samples and better imputation panels will facilitate identifying them.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	While these rare variants may not contribute substantially to the predictive value of genetic findings, they will enhance the understanding of disease mechanisms and potential drug targets.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Discovery of the risk genes at genome-wide loci remains challenging, but we demonstrate that converging evidence from existing and new analyses can prioritize risk genes.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We also show that APP metabolism is associated with not only early-onset Alzheimer's disease but also LOAD, suggesting that therapies developed by studying early-onset families could also be applicable to the more common late-onset form of the disease.
0	Alzheimer's disease	tau	NA	DISCUSS	Pathway analysis showing that tau is involved in LOAD supports recent evidence that tau may play an early pathological role in Alzheimer's disease and confirms that therapies targeting tangle formation/degradation could potentially affect LOAD.
0	NA	DQB1	NA	DISCUSS	Finally, our fine-mapping analyses of HLA and genetic correlation results point to LOAD's shared genetic architecture with many immunemediated and cognitive traits, suggesting that research and interventions that elucidate mechanisms behind these relationships could also yield fruitful therapeutic strategies for LOAD
