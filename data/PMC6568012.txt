0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	We meta-analyzed genotype data from a custom high-density array of 46,939 PrCa cases and 27,910 controls of European ancestry with previously genotyped data of 32,255 PrCa cases and 33,202 controls of European ancestry.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Our analysis identified 62 novel loci associated (P<5.0x10-8) with PrCa and one locus significantly associated with early-onset PrCa (<=55 years).
1	NA	ATM	rs1800057	ABSTRACT	Our findings include missense variants rs1800057 (odds ratio (OR) = 1.16; P = 8.2x10-9; G>C, p.Pro1054Arg) in ATM and rs2066827 (OR = 1.06; P = 2.3 x 10-9; T>G, p.Val109Gly) in CDKN1B.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	The combination of all loci captured 28.4% of the PrCa familial relative risk, and a polygenic risk score conferred an elevated PrCa risk for men in the ninetieth to ninety-ninth percentiles (relative risk = 2.69; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.55-2.82) and first percentile (relative risk = 5.71; 95% CI: 5.04-6.48) risk stratum compared with the population average.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	These findings improve risk prediction, enhance fine-mapping, and provide insight into the underlying biology of PrCa
0	cancers	NA	NA	INTRO	Although PrCa is the most common noncutaneous cancer among men in the Western world, and one in seven men will be diagnosed during their lifetime, very few modifiable risk factors have been established.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Epidemiological studies have identified age, positive family history, and ancestry as the most prominent risk factors for PrCa.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	PrCa incidence is highest among men of African ancestry, followed by men of European and Asian ancestries.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	These observations of ancestral differences in PrCa risk, in conjunction with studies demonstrating the influence of family history, highlight the contribution of genetics to PrCa etiology.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Our previous work, using a multiplicative model, has estimated that more than 1,800 common SNPs independently contribute to PrCa risk among populations of European ancestry.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	GWAS have reported more than 100 of these PrCa variants across multiancestral populations, most of which were identified in populations of European ancestry
0	cancers	NA	NA	INTRO	To facilitate additional discovery of PrCa genetic risk factors, we developed a custom high-density genotyping array, the OncoArray, including a 260,000-SNP backbone designed to adequately tag most common genetic variants (minor allele frequency (MAF) >5% in Europeans), and 310,000 SNPs from meta-analyses of five cancers (breast, colorectal, lung, ovarian, and prostate).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Approximately 80,000 PrCa-specific markers derived from our previous multiancestral meta-analysis (including populations of European, African American, Japanese, and Latino ancestry), fine-mapping of known PrCa loci, and candidate SNPs nominated by study collaborators were included on the OncoArray.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We assembled a new PrCa sample series from 52 studies to genotype with the OncoArray (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2).

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	SNPs that were associated with disease risk at P < 5 x 10-8 in the meta-analysis (GWAS and OncoArray) were considered novel.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The SNP with the lowest P value in a region was considered the lead SNP.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Imputation quality was assessed on the basis of IMPUTE2 imputation r2 in the OncoArray dataset (Supplementary Table 8)
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	For ten regions where the newly identified locus was near a previously known region, we reported a novel association if the pairwise r2 between the new and the previously known SNP was <0.2.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	For novel PrCa associations for which the variant was imputed in the OncoArray study sample series and had an imputed quality score <0.70, we assessed the quality of the imputation by masking the variant in a subset of the 1KGP European sample and calculating the concordance after reimputation in the remaining 1KGP samples
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Novel SNPs with an IMPUTE2 r2 <0.80 among the OncoArray sample series (Supplementary Table 8) were flagged for further investigation to minimize the probability of false positives.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	First, we examined LD plots (http://locuszoom.org/) for poorly imputed SNPs (+-500 kb), including only genotyped SNPs within the region.
