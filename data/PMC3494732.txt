0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Prostate cancer displays dramatic differences in incidence rates across racial/ethnic populations.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	In the United States, African-Americans have the highest incidence rate of prostate cancer followed by European Americans, Latinos, and Asians.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	The contribution of genetic variants to prostate cancer risk likely varies across race/ethnicity and may play a key role in the unequal burden of disease across racial/ethnic groups.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	The first wave of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of prostate cancer were heavily weighted by studies of European men, revealing more than 40 prostate cancer risk variants, many of which replicated in subsequent studies of non-European populations.

0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In addition, because of the lack of additional studies of prostate cancer in Latinos, we were unable to replicate our stage 1 findings in Latino populations and made use of available European data.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The Latinos in the MEC are predominantly from Mexico and are highly admixed with Native American (38%), European (59%), and African (3%) ancestry.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	While replication testing of the most significant findings in Europeans allowed for discovery of alleles that are common in European groups, we may have missed alleles that may be important to Latinos.

0	NA	NA	rs2660753	DISCUSS	For the association at 3p12 (rs2660753) reported by Yamada et al., we observed a non-significant positive association with the risk allele of rs2660753 among Japanese (OR=1.14; P=0.084) and a significant association in Latinos (OR=1.23; P=7.2x10-3).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Of the previous 8q24 associations in these Japanese studies, our findings in this larger MEC study confirm that there are multiple association signals at 8q24.

0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	rs12653946	DISCUSS	Three of these risk variants (rs12653946, rs339331, and rs9600079) were associated with prostate cancer in Chinese men, providing evidence that some risk loci found in Japanese generalize to Chinese men.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	For Latinos, only one additional study outside of the MEC has reported the effects of prostate cancer risk variants.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In this study of 196 Latino prostate cancer cases and 472 controls, 12 SNPs at 8q24 were associated with prostate cancer risk.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Overall, aside from our reduced power to detect the originally reported effect estimates of small magnitude (Supplemental Table 6), our study was able to show positive associations for the majority of risk variants (> ~80%) among Japanese and Latinos.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Moreover, our study not only corroborates previous reports, but also provides the largest and most comprehensive evaluation to date of known prostate cancer risk variants and their cumulative genetic effect among Japanese and Latinos
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Given adequate statistical power, there are many questions directed towards understanding the reproducibility of risk variants across populations.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	There are three possible scenarios to consider.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	First, the disease locus identified by GWAS of European populations may not be relevant in other populations because the functional allele is limited to Europeans.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Second, the locus is important in other populations, however a different variant (not the index SNP) is better in capturing risk in specific racial/ethnic populations as patterns of LD may vary between the index variant and functional allele across ancestral groups.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Thus, fine-mapping of risk loci in different racial/ethnic groups could identify the most appropriate variant for a particular population.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Lastly, the index risk variant identified in GWAS of Europeans is similarly associated with risk in other racial/ethnic groups.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	"Directional consistency of an association for a given index signal across populations implies a shared functional common variant in each region and provides little support for the ""synthetic association"" model, which suggests that GWAS signals with common alleles are due to rare alleles, many of which are likely to be ethnically distinct."
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	For the majority of the risk loci examined in this study, our observations support the existence of a common functional variant that is shared across populations
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	As more prostate cancer risk variants are identified, the cumulative effects of these variants may have important clinical implications.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	With the 56 risk variants we examined, both Japanese and Latinos at the top quartile of the risk distribution had a highly significant ~3-fold increased risk of prostate cancer in comparison to those at the lowest quartile.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In the absence of an established risk model of prostate cancer analogous to the Gail model for breast cancer, as more risk variants are identified, a SNP based risk model for prostate cancer may serve as a useful tool to define high-risk populations for targeted screening regimens and may better inform clinical decision making.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Such models in development incorporate SNPs and family history in predicting prostate cancer risk.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	For individuals not at the high end of a genetic risk score, the clinical usefulness of such genetic information is unclear.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Given the potential risks and costs associated with prostate cancer screening, these men may be less inclined to seek screening
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In summary, we did not identify novel genome-wide significant prostate cancer loci for Japanese and Latino men.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, we established that known risk variants for prostate cancer contribute to prostate cancer risk susceptibility in these populations.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The challenge remains to conduct large well-powered genome-wide scans and follow-up studies in diverse populations to further dissect the complete array of risk alleles that may contribute to prostate cancer across populations
