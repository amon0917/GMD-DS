0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified several risk loci for Alzheimer's disease (AD).
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Nonetheless, these loci do not explain the entire susceptibility of the disease, suggesting that other genetic contributions remain to be identified.
1	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Here, we performed a meta-analysis combining data of 4,569 individuals (2,540 cases and 2,029 healthy controls) derived from three publicly available GWAS in AD and replicated a broad genomic region (>248,000 bp) associated with the disease near the APOE/TOMM40 locus in chromosome 19.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	To detect minor effect size contributions that could help to explain the remaining genetic risk, we conducted network-based pathway analyses either by extracting gene-wise p-values (GW), defined as the single strongest association signal within a gene, or calculated a more stringent gene-based association p-value using the extended Simes (GATES) procedure.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Comparison of these strategies revealed that ontological sub-networks (SNs) involved in glutamate signaling were significantly overrepresented in AD (p<2.7x10-11, p<1.9x10-11; GW and GATES, respectively).
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Notably, glutamate signaling SNs were also found to be significantly overrepresented (p<5.1x10-8) in the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study, which was used as a targeted replication sample.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Interestingly, components of the glutamate signaling SNs are coordinately expressed in disease-related tissues, which are tightly related to known pathological hallmarks of AD.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Our findings suggest that genetic variation within glutamate signaling contributes to the remaining genetic risk of AD and support the notion that functional biological networks should be targeted in future therapies aimed to prevent or treat this devastating neurological disorder
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Alzheimer's disease (AD [MIM 104300]) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder in the human population.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Clinically, AD is characterized by a progressive loss of cognitive abilities and memory impairment.
0	neuronal loss	beta-amyloid (Abeta)	NA	INTRO	At a biological level, it is thought that the presence of extracellular deposits of the beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated Tau protein leads to synaptic loss and neuronal death.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Genetically, AD is complex and heterogeneous.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	"A small percentage of AD cases (1-2% of all cases) have an early-onset familial form of presentation, with symptoms appearing before 65 years of age, and most cases are late-onset or ""sporadic"" with no apparent familial recurrence of the disease."
0	Alzheimer's disease	beta-amyloid (Abeta)	NA	INTRO	While familial-AD has been associated with mutations in the genes coding for the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and the presenilins (PSEN1 and PSEN2) proteins, the only genetic factor extensively replicated for sporadic AD is the apolipoprotein E-epsilon4 (APOE-epsilon4) allele, which is present in ca.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	60% of the cases.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	However, the APOE-epsilon4 allele is not causative, since it has been found in individuals that would not develop the disease, suggesting that other genetic contributions remain to be identified
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	During the past decade, the scientific efforts focused in identifying these genetic hallmarks reported more than 2,900 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) within ~ 4,700 genes associated with AD (see also AlzGene.org).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	More recently, the use of high density DNA genotyping microarrays in genome-wide associations studies (GWAS), combined with powerful statistical procedures, have expanded the search for novel susceptibility loci for the disease.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Nevertheless, these genetic approaches currently exhibit some limitations.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	First, they present a high rate of false positives and require major sample sizes in order to be replicated.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In fact, different simulations have shown that authentic associations have only a 26% chance of falling into the top 1,000 p-values in a GWAS.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Second, they only examine the association of a single genetic variant at a time, therefore failing in the detection of minor associations that can still be present and confer risk in a cumulative way.
0	Alzheimer's disease	BIN1	NA	INTRO	Finally, current top hits associated with AD, including the bridging integrator 1 (BIN1), clusterin (CLU), the ATP-binding cassette sub-family A member 7 (ABCA7), the complement component (3b/4b) receptor 1 (CR1), and the phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM), do not account for the entire genetic contribution of the disease or surpass the risk conferred solely by the APOE-epsilon4 allele
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Therefore, considering that the etiology of complex diseases might depend on functional protein-protein interaction networks, here we performed a meta-analysis followed by network-based pathway analyses on publicly available GWAS in AD and used significant genetic information to identify glutamate signaling as a key ontological pathway of the disease
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	METHODS	We selected three publicly available GWAS in AD performed on unrelated case-control and familial samples from European-descent populations (Table 1).
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	METHODS	The GWAS datasets are: i) the Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen1) study on AD, including 829 AD cases and 535 control individuals; ii) the National Institute on Aging - Late Onset Alzheimer's Disease and the National Cell Repository for Alzheimer's Disease (NIA-LOAD/NCRAD), including 5,220 subjects from which we only considered for analysis a subset of 3,689 individuals (1,837 cases and 1,852 controls) that were self-declared non-Hispanic European Americans, passed principal components analyses and had non-missing phenotypes.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	METHODS	Given that this subset is composed by familial data, using the provided family trees, we excluded all related controls and kept only one case per family giving a final number of 978 AD cases and 702 controls individuals that were eligible for our study; and iii) the Pfizer Pharmaceutical Company (Pfizer) study on AD, including 733 AD cases and 792 control individuals, available only at summary level.

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	ADNI is the result of efforts of many co-investigators from a broad range of academic institutions and private corporations, and subjects have been recruited from over 50 sites across the U.S. and Canada.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The initial goal of ADNI was to recruit 800 subjects but ADNI has been followed by ADNI-GO and ADNI-2.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	METHODS	To date these three protocols have recruited over 1500 adults, ages 55 to 90, to participate in the research, consisting of cognitively normal older individuals, people with early or late MCI, and people with early AD.

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Subjects originally recruited for ADNI-1 and ADNI-GO had the option to be followed in ADNI-2.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	METHODS	After QC procedures (See below; Association analysis) the final ADNI sample consisted in a total of 693 individuals, 449 cases (161 AD and 338 MCI Cases) and 194 unrelated controls.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	A total of 524,993 SNPs were genotyped under the Illumina 610 Quad platform (Table 1)
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	In order to maximize information on linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure between the studies, the TGen1 and the NIA-LOAD/NCRAD datasets were imputed by comparison with the CEU reference panel (unrelated individuals) from the HapMap III phased data (release 2).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Imputation was carried out using the Markov Chain Haplotyping method implemented in MACH 1.0 following author recommendations
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Quality control (QC) procedures such as minor allele frequency (MAF), Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), missing rate per individuals (MIND) and per SNPs (GENO) were performed on the TGen1 and the NIA-LOAD/NCRAD dataset using PLINK v.1.07 (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/purcell/plink/) with threshold values of 0.05, 1x10-6, 0.05 and 0.02, respectively.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We applied a logistic regression analysis, using an additive model on the imputed datasets data with MACH2DAT.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	SNPs with r2 values less than 0.29 were removed from further analysis.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Similarly, in the Pfizer dataset, the standard error (SE) per SNP was estimated from the p-values reported in the study.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Briefly, p-values were transformed into the corresponding Z score with the INVNORMAL function implemented in STATA v.10 (StataCorp, College Station, TX), and then the SE was calculated taking the log of the odds ratios (OR) divided by the corresponding Z score.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	In the ADNI replication dataset, we performed QC and association analysis based on a quantitative trait locus (QTL) method as described previously.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	MAF, HWE, MIND and GENO QC values of 0.05, 1x10-6, 0.1 and 0.1 were applied, respectively.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	In order to control for population stratification we conducted Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with EIGENSTRAT.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	After this step, 63 individuals were excluded from further analysis, leaving a total 693 individuals.
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	METHODS	The QTL association analysis was carried out using an additive genetic linear regression model with PLINK using different co-variables including age at baseline visit, education, gender and APOE status (epsilon4 allele present or not).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Finally, the results for each dataset was assessed for genomic inflation and visualized in Quantile-Quantile (Q-Q) plots using the statistical R (www.r-project.org)
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Meta-analysis was performed using the inverse variance method implemented in PLINK v.1.07.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We checked that all statistics values (p-values, OR and SE) for each dataset prior the meta-analysis were computed for the same allele.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Annotation of the results was done with the RefSeq Genes for the human genome assembly Build 36.3/Hg18 available at the UCSC Table Browser using own Perl scripts (available upon request).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	In order to consider a SNP inside a gene we defined a threshold of +/- 5,000 bp relative to the transcription start and end sites.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The annotated output of the meta-analysis used for the pathway approach is available in Table S1.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	PRISMA guidelines were followed (showed in Checklist S1)
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Genetic association values with a cut-off threshold of p<0.05, from either the Meta-analysis or the ADNI replication dataset, were transformed into single-gene associations using two independent approaches: i) Selection of a gene-wise p-value (GW), defined as the single strongest association inside a gene; and ii) Calculation of a gene-based association p-value using the extended Simes procedure (GATES), which extract a gene-level association from the combination of the SNPs p-values within a gene.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	This approach does not relies on genotype or phenotypic data and has been shown to correct type 1 error rates in both simulated and permuted datasets, regardless of the gene size or LD structure.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	GATES is an open-source tool named Knowledge-Based Mining System for Genome-wide Genetic Studies (KGG; http://http://bioinfo1.hku.hk:13080/kggweb/)
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	To evaluate single-gene associations in a network context the complete human functional protein association network (FPAN) was retrieved from the STRING 9.0 database (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins; http://string-db.org/).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	FPAN contains highly curated known and predicted interactions emerging from different evidence channels such as: genomic context, co-expression and curated literature.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Raw text-formatted protein-protein functional interactions were downloaded from STRING.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	To avoid redundancy and false positives, alternative proteins and their interactions were consolidated into one gene using own Perl scripts (available upon request).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We kept only the interactions with a combined score >0.7 (provided by STRING), which stand for high confidence interactions.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The final FPAN generated was composed by 14,793 nodes (genes) and 229,357 edges (interactions) and was introduced as an input to Cytoscape, which is an open source platform for visualizing complex networks that not only allows the integration of additional attribute data (i.e.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	gene annotations, expression profiles and interactions source and confidence), but also provides a comprehensive set of tools to perform integrated pathways analysis.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Thus, the p-values of GW and GATES procedures were introduced as a floating-point attribute into the FPAN (Table S2)
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	SNs search was carried out with the Cytoscape JActive Modules Plug-in with a gene overlap threshold of 50%.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	JActive modules is designed to detect if a certain group of connected nodes are significantly enriched with a statistical parameter such as the single gene p-value, which in our study comes from either the meta-analysis or the ADNI replication dataset.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Briefly, starting from one node a sub-network grows to its connected genes by computing an aggregated score (S) derived from the conversion of the single-gene p-value (if present) into their corresponding z-score (with the inverse normal cumulative distribution function).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	This score is compared internally with a background distribution created from the scores of 10,000 random modules of the same size in a Monte Carlo procedure.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	If the aggregated score cease growing above the expected by chance, the algorithm stops and the growing sub-network is reported as a result.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	As in the original publication, modules with S>3 (3 standard deviation above the mean of randomized scores) and with a size below 50 were considered significant.
0	NA	SN	NA	METHODS	To acquire a mean S score and standard deviation (SD) for each resulting SN and to confirm that the SN structure (gene members and interactions) and significance remained consistent and replicable, the search was performed 10 times for each analysis (Meta-GW, Meta-GATES, ADNI-GW and ADNI-GATES).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Finally, the same procedure was conducted with their corresponding permuted p-values over the entire genes present in the FPAN (Permuted analysis) and without genome wide significant results (p-values <10-8), in this case with real and permuted data, respectively (WGW analysis).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Statistical differences between permuted and non-permuted analyses were assessed through two-sided t-test
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	To examine if the structure of significant sub-networks obtained in the Meta or the ADNI replication dataset were biologically meaningful, gene lists of the first 10 significant modules were tested for pathway enrichment using information from Gene Ontology (GO; http://geneontology.org/) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database (KEGG; http://www.genome.jp/kegg/).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We initially used the ontology structure and annotations using the package Ontologizer, only considering categories with less than 500 members to avoid associations to major categories that are less informative (i.e.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	"signaling) and excluding the ones ""Inferred by Electronic Annotation"" (IEA), from ""Reviewed Computational Analysis"" (RCA) and with ""No biological Data available"" (ND), which are characterized by a high rate of false positives."
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	In this case, we used the parent-child-union algorithm to call for overrepresentation adjusting the p-values with a Westfall-Young Single-Step multiple test correction, to avoid additional false positives, and considering a GO term significantly over-represented when the adjusted p-value was below 0.01.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Similarly, to determine overrepresentation, KEGG pathway enrichment was assessed in the complete set of pathways and components, using an hypergeometric test with the phyper function contained in the R statistical package
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	To evaluate the expression pattern of genes of interest from the network-based analysis, human gene expression profiles were downloaded from the Allen Brain Atlas (ABA) website (http://www.brain-map.org).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We used the Gene Search web-tool to enter a list of genes arising from the intersection of sub-networks and analyzed their expression profiles through 27 brain regions.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We averaged the expression levels from 6 brain donor individuals (ids.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	H0351.2001, H0351.2002, H0351.1009, H0351.1012, H0351.1015 and H0351.1016) and used the collapseRows R script to generate a gene-wise expression dataset.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Expression heatmaps and hierarchical clusters were analyzed using Cluster v.3.0 (http://www.geo.vu.nl/~huik/cluster.htm) and visualized with the aid of JavaTreeView v.1.1.6r2 (http://jtreeview.sourceforge.net).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Identification of genes co-expressed and correlation analyses were performed with Cluster v.3.0, using Euclidean distance in conjunction with centroid linkage algorithms, and a correlation coefficient cutoff of r>0.7 to denote highly correlated gene clusters

0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	"We note that the strength of the association signal for some SNPs is derived from the Pfizer and NIA-LOAD/NCRAD datasets only, since these were either not genotyped in the TGen1 sample or poorly imputed due to the intrinsic array density in that particular region of chromosome 19 in the Affimetrix GeneChip 500 K (See ""N"" column, Table 2)."

0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	To test the hypothesis that highly-connected sub-networks (SNs) enriched with minor associations might be significantly overrepresented in AD, we performed a gene-oriented pathway analysis by loading meta-analysis results into a high confidence functional protein association network (FPAN), gathered from the STRING database.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	First, to avoid noise, the analysis was restricted to SNPs with p-value <0.05 (Table S1).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Second, we calculated whole-gene association values using two alternative approaches: (i) the extraction of a gene-wise p-value, corresponding to the strongest association signal within a gene (Meta-GW); and (ii) the derivation of a more stringent gene-based p-value using the extended Simes test (Meta-GATES), which combines all association signals within a gene and controls for the bias that could be generated by gene-size or LD structure among markers.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Thus, we observed 66,204 SNP association p-values <0.05 tagging 7,527 genes.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Of these, we loaded only 4,891 and 4,647 gene p-values (from GW and GATES procedures, respectively) into FPAN (Table S2), which was composed by 14,793 genes having 229,357 non-redundant high-confidence interactions (note that not all genes are informative in the FPAN).
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	Third, we conducted the search for significant SNs in AD using the information from GW and GATES procedures in comparison with an expected background distribution among the FPAN created from 10,000 permutations (See Methods).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Fourth, we repeated the search 10 times in order to explore whether the SNs structure (gene members), interactions and significance was consistent across iterations and not the result of the Monte Carlo procedure.
0	NA	SN	NA	RESULTS	As an example, we observed that the top SN1 had a 97.6% of concordance in gene structure and interactions (see also Table S3).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Fifth, the above results were controlled by 2 further module searches, this time including permuted data or results without genome wide (WGW) significance (Figure 1).
0	NA	SN	NA	RESULTS	While in the former search, the p-values were permuted 10 times over the entire FPAN to determine if the SN structure and its score could be obtained by chance (Meta-GW-Permuted, Meta-GATES-Permuted); in the latter, we discarded the possibility that the SNs could be the result of bias due to the strong genome-wide significant p-values within the APOE locus
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	The result of the global search for overrepresented modules in AD is presented in Figure 3.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	First, the total number of significant SNs obtained in the Meta-GW analysis (average number  = 32.3, SD = 6.14) was significantly higher (p = 2.51x10-7), than those arising from chance (Figure 3A; Meta-GW Permuted; average = 13.7, SD = 4.05).

1	Alzheimer's disease	TOMM40	NA	DISCUSS	In agreement with previous GWAS in AD our meta-analysis detected strong genome-wide association signals in a 250 kb window of chromosome 19, centered in the coding/regulatory region of the TOMM40 gene, in close proximity to the APOE locus, and that also included significant signals in the PVRL2, APOC1, BCAM and BCL3 genes.
1	Alzheimer's disease	apolipoprotein E	NA	DISCUSS	While it has been suggested that the association of such extended region may reflect that other variants in LD with APOE may be of pathogenic importance, particularly a poly-T track in the TOMM40 gene, recent studies have shown that APOE alleles account for essentially all the inherited risk of AD associated in this region.
0	NA	MS4A3	NA	DISCUSS	Besides the signal in chromosome 19, we detected marginal associations of 2 novel SNPs in the MS4A3 gene, located in a wide LD region containing a cluster of SNPs in the MS4A6A/MS4A4E loci in the long arm of chromosome 11 (i.e.
0	NA	NA	rs610932	DISCUSS	rs610932, rs670139, rs1562990, rs4938933 and rs983392), which reached genome-wide significant levels by other recent studies
0	Alzheimer's disease	apolipoprotein E	NA	DISCUSS	Assuming that the APOE locus is the major genetic hallmark associated with the disease and that it does not explain the entire susceptibility of AD, we conducted a network-based pathway analysis with our meta-analysis results to explore the biology behind variants with minor effect size.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Initially, to integrate the whole genetic contribution from the meta-analysis we used a gene-wise p-value (GW, single min p-value method) that has been widely applied in detecting novel associations using GWAS data.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Although this approach has a certain bias for pathways enriched with larger genes and does not consider intergenic associations or LD structure, we note that the random permutation of p-values yielded a distribution of results expected by chance from where the actual data could be compared.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Likewise, with the search for significant sub-networks with real and permuted data, and additionally with the WGW control, we believe that the actual contribution of the aforementioned problems to the final result is strongly surpassed by the combination of true minor effect size variants.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Still, we considered appropriated the introduction of the GATES procedure that is specifically designed to directly address the gene size and LD structure issues and thus we ended up with a more stringent gene-oriented p-value.
0	NA	SN	NA	DISCUSS	Notably, through this approach we replicated essentially the same SN (i.e.
0	NA	SN	rs4820537	DISCUSS	GW and GATES SN1), which was populated by genes related to glutamate signaling, differing only in the absence of GNAZ gene whose only association in the meta-analysis (Table S1; rs4820537, p = 0.02096) was found not informative in the GATES procedure.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Glutamate signaling was further replicated in the ADNI dataset and this time it reached significant association levels in three SNs (ADNI-GW SN3, SN4 and SN7)
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	From a biological point of view, the relationship of these genetic observations with current knowledge about AD is straightforward.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Glutamate signaling has been reported to regulate multiple biological processes, including fast excitatory synaptic transmission, neuronal growth and differentiation, synaptic plasticity, learning and memory.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Degenerating neurons and synapses in AD brains are usually located within regions that project to or from areas displaying high densities of Abeta plaques and tangles and in this regard, glutamatergic neurons located in the hippocampus, as well as in other areas of the brain, are severely affected by these neurotoxic insults.
0	Geriatric Depression	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Likewise, it has been established that there is a relationship between glutamate receptor signaling and soluble Abeta oligomers in the hippocampus, affecting their expression and recycling, which leads to long term depression, synaptic loss and ultimately to cognitive deficit.
0	neuronal loss	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Moreover, sustained activation of glutamate receptors at the synapse rise Ca2+ influxes and second messenger levels activating neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NO), increasing reactive nitrogen and oxygen species, thus contributing to neuronal damage independently of the presence of Abeta oligomers.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Alternatively, and from a genomic perspective, here we provide strong evidence that common genetic variants within a complete set of genes acting as ionotropic/metabotropic glutamate receptors and its downstream effectors are associated in a network context with AD.
0	cognitive defects	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Accordingly, it has been recently reported that pathways related to neurotransmitter receptor-mediated calcium signaling and long-term potentiation are similarly associated with mild cognitive impairment and AD.
0	hypothalamus	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In addition we have found that the expression pattern of these glutamate signaling genes cluster in specific brain regions, which are affected during the development of the disease, such as the hippocampal formation and the hypothalamus.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Therefore, it will be interesting to learn if the genes identified through our network-based pathway approach are spatially and coordinately modulated at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level as a result of various trophic or toxic stimuli.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Finally, our data extends the notion that the remaining genetic risk for complex traits, such as AD, is likely explained by the accumulation of functional genetic variants inside an entire pathway, rather than by punctual independent mutations
