0	breast cancer	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Genome wide association studies (GWAs) of breast cancer mortality have identified few potential associations.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	The concordance between these studies is unclear.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	In this study, we used a meta-analysis of two prognostic GWAs and a replication cohort to identify the strongest associations and to evaluate the loci suggested in previous studies.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	We attempt to identify those SNPs which could impact overall survival irrespective of the age of onset
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	To facilitate the meta-analysis and to refine the association signals, SNPs were imputed using data from the 1000 genomes project.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Cox-proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) in 536 patients from the POSH cohort (Prospective study of Outcomes in Sporadic versus Hereditary breast cancer) and 805 patients from the HEBCS cohort (Helsinki Breast Cancer Study).
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	These hazard ratios were combined using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed effects meta-analysis and a p-value threshold of 5x10-8 was used to determine significance.
0	NA	POSH	NA	ABSTRACT	Replication was performed in 1523 additional patients from the POSH study
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Although no SNPs achieved genome wide significance, three SNPs have significant association in the replication cohort and combined p-values less than 5.6x10-6.
1	NA	ARRDC3	rs421379	ABSTRACT	These SNPs are; rs421379 which is 556 kb upstream of ARRDC3 (HR = 1.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.27-1.75, P = 1.1x10-6), rs12358475 which is between ECHDC3 and PROSER2 (HR = 0.75, CI = 0.67-0.85, P = 1.8x10-6), and rs1728400 which is between LINC00917 and FOXF1
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	In a genome wide meta-analysis of two independent cohorts from UK and Finland, we identified potential associations at three distinct loci.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Phenotypic heterogeneity and relatively small sample sizes may explain the lack of genome wide significant findings.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	However, the replication at three SNPs in the validation cohort shows promise for future studies in larger cohorts.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	We did not find strong evidence for concordance between the few associations highlighted by previous GWAs of breast cancer survival and this study
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Although the incidence of breast cancer has been relatively stable since 2003, at 157 new cases per 100,000, it remains the most common cancer in the UK and accounts for 31% of new cancer cases in women.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	The latest age-standardised survival rate for breast cancer in England is predicted to be 85% at 5 years, falling to 65% at 20 years.
0	cancers	NA	NA	INTRO	Traditionally prognostic information is derived from tumour phenotypic characteristics including tumour size, stage, and grade.
0	cancers	ER	NA	INTRO	These tumour phenotypes and cancer cell surface receptors such as oestrogen receptor (ER) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) are also used to guide treatment.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Although the breast cancer survival rate has improved, the response to treatment and longevity of patients is often unpredictable even between those with similar tumours and general health.
0	cancers	NA	NA	INTRO	More recently tumour genomic profiling experiments have suggested cancer molecular signatures may give more accurate prognostic information.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	These signatures may predict outcome better than conventional histopathology based risk algorithms but are not in routine clinical use
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Familial studies suggest a genetic component for breast cancer prognosis.
0	cancers	NA	NA	INTRO	The familial contribution to prognosis may arise as a result of the background genotype affecting acquired tumour characteristics which influence prognosis.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Indeed high penetrance predisposition genes which lead to the consistent development of specific breast tumour sub-types have been identified.
0	breast cancer	ER	NA	INTRO	Low penetrance risk SNPs tend to be associated with either ER positive or ER negative breast cancer but often not both.
0	cancers	NA	NA	INTRO	In addition there may be pharmacogenomic effects of background genotype on response to cancer treatment.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	It is anticipated that genome wide association studies (GWAs) with sufficient sample size and genetic coverage may lead to novel insights into common inherited genetic variants which influence prognosis
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	In the past few years several GWAs of breast cancer survival have been reported.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	These studies have had limited success and none of them have identified variants that are associated at genome wide levels of significance.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	While small sample sizes are likely to be of one of the main factors responsible for the modest levels of significance and lack of concordance between the GWAs; small effect sizes, incomplete genetic coverage, and phenotypic heterogeneity could also contribute and need to be addressed
0	breast cancer	POSH	NA	INTRO	In this study, we used a meta-analysis to combine evidence from two GWAs consisting of 536 patients from the POSH cohort (Prospective study of Outcomes in Sporadic versus Hereditary breast cancer) and 805 patients from the HEBCS cohort (Helsinki Breast Cancer Study).

0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	As such if rs1728400t has a replicable impact on breast cancer prognosis then it could act via a different set of transcription factors than those activated in oesophageal carcinoma
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Although the study reported here is not the largest study undertaken for identifying common variants associated with breast cancer mortality, it has several methodological strengths.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	It is the first study to Meta-analyse associations of common genetic variants with breast cancer related mortality on a genome wide level across two independent prospective studies of breast cancer patients.
0	breast cancer	POSH	NA	DISCUSS	Further both POSH and HEBCS are prospective studies of breast cancer patients who were recruited in similar clinical settings and both cohorts have relatively high breast cancer specific mortality.
0	death	NA	NA	DISCUSS	As such, heterogeneity between causes of death is reduced in the meta-analysis.
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	With respect to potential tumour phenotypic heterogeneity both studies were not selected for specific breast tumour sub-types so this remains a potential methodological problem if the effect of SNPs relates to a particular tumour sub-type or a particular modality of treatment
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	It was encouraging to note that 9 off the 18 SNPs which we had marked for replication testing were associated in the same direction as in the discovery set.

0	breast cancer	TNRC9	rs3803662	DISCUSS	The association of SNP rs3803662 (TOX3), highlighted by Fasching et al, as potentially associated with breast cancer specific survival did not replicate in our meta-analysis (HR = 0.90, p = 0.09).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The lone SNP highlighted by Azzato et al, as associated with survival in ER-negative patients was not available in the genome wide genotyped or imputed data, further no proxies at r2>=0.6 were identified based on HapMap phase 3 data.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	So unfortunately replication of this SNP could not be tested in our study
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Future studies with a similar ascertainment framework but with larger sample size, detailed tumour sub-type phenotyping and similar treatment modalities will be required to allow sub-type specific patient cohorts to be used for discovery and validation.
0	breast cancer	MAF	NA	DISCUSS	A more detailed search for variants with MAF <0.05 may be necessary to fully comprehend the extent of intrinsic host genetic factors in determining breast cancer prognosis
0	NA	POSH	NA	DISCUSS	The main strengths of this study are the high genetic coverage achieved by using the Illumina 550 K and Illumin660 K chips in the Helsinki and POSH studies respectively.
0	NA	MAF	NA	DISCUSS	In addition we have also performed comprehensive imputation of common genetic variation (maf > = 5%) based on the LD patterns in the 1000 genomes project.
0	NA	MAF	NA	DISCUSS	We had sufficient statistical power to detect genetic variants which were associated with survival at HR>=1.23 while studying SNPs with maf >=10%.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Future studies using well annotated collaborative samples will be needed to perform sub-type specific analysis and replication to detect small effect sizes.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Such a strategy has the potential to identify multiple genetic variants which are associated at HRs lower than 1.20.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However a trade-off between the increases in effect sizes that may result from studying associations in specific homogeneous sub-groups may mitigate smaller sample sizes
