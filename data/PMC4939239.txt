0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Lung cancer is the second most common cancer in US men and women and has the highest death rate.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	There is a substantial disparity in African-American men, who have higher age-adjusted incidence rates (99.9 per 100,000) when compared with Caucasian and Asian men (76.4 and 52.2 per 100,000, respectively), as well as higher age-adjusted death rates (African American 82.6 per 100,000; Caucasian 65.3 per 100,000; Asian 35.9 per 100,000).
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Smoking represents the major risk factor for lung cancer.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Known differences in smoking-related exposures for African Americans could contribute to the observed differences in incidence, including age of smoking initiation, intensity of smoking, and quitting and relapse behaviors.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	It has been estimated that approximately eighty-five percent of lung cancer risk is attributed to cigarette smoking; however, the higher incidence seen in African Americans occurs even though they smoke fewer cigarettes per day than their Caucasian counterparts.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Family and twin studies, as well as lung cancer genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have confirmed an underlying genetic contribution to lung cancer risk as well.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	To date, GWAS performed in populations of European and Asian descent have identified over 15 lung cancer risk loci (Supplementary Table 1).
1	prostate carcinogenesis	TERT	NA	INTRO	Interestingly, other than the hTERT region on chromosome 5p15, the regions identified in non-smoking Asian women do not overlap with the regions identified in Europeans who smoke, suggesting distinct genetic contributions to primary lung carcinogenesis and smoking-related carcinogenesis.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Although African Americans have higher lung cancer incidence and poorer lung cancer survival when compared with other racial and ethnic populations in the United States, no GWAS has been conducted in this population.

0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This SNP has also been associated with nicotine dependence in the Finnish Twin Cohort Study and cigarettes smoked per day.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, we did not see a similar association in our data when examining current versus former smokers (p=0.29), and only nominally significant (p=0.038) if modeling cigarettes smoked per day, perhaps due to the small sample size and that African Americans on average smoke cigarettes differently than Caucasians.

0	NA	NA	rs16969968	DISCUSS	However, a more recent meta-analysis showed rs16969968 is associated with increased risk for nicotine dependence in European and African Americans and provided evidence that the A allele increases risk for heavy smoking.
0	NA	NA	rs16969968	DISCUSS	In another study, rs16969968 was not found to be consistently associated with smoking abstinence in African Americans; whereas rs2036527 was associated with active pharmacotherapy.
