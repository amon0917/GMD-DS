0	Colon and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The risks at all ages for the 10% at highest or lowest risk of breast and ovarian cancer are predicted to be similar to those for the highest and lowest 5%.
0	NA	BRCA1	NA	DISCUSS	Thus, at least 20% of BRCA1 mutation carriers are predicted to have absolute risks of disease that are different from the average BRCA1 carriers.
0	cancers	BRCA1	NA	DISCUSS	These large differences in cancer risks may have practical implications for the clinical management of BRCA1 mutation carriers, for example in deciding the timing of interventions.
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Such risks, in combination with other lifestyle and hormonal risk factors could be incorporated into cancer risk prediction algorithms for use by clinical genetics centers.
0	NA	BRCA1	NA	DISCUSS	These algorithms could then be used to inform the development of effective and consistent clinical recommendations for the clinical management of BRCA1 mutation carriers
