0	diabetes	NA	NA	METHODS	The subset of JHS participants with diabetes was between 35 and 84 years old
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	CAC was quantified by non-contrast, ECG gated, cardiac computed tomography (CT) in both studies using established methods.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	In AA-DHS, from the start of the study in 1999, four generations of CT scanners all with ECG gating were utilized (CTi, QXi, 16Pro and VCT, GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Image spatial resolution, reconstruction kernel and image technique were held constant.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	CAC was measured on a workstation and reported as the Agatston Score using a 90 Hounsfield Unit (HU) threshold (SmartScore GE Healthcare).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Additional scoring parameters included a 130 HU threshold and 2 adjacent pixels used to define the maximum calcified lesion size; the program accounted for slice thickness.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	In JHS, calcified plaque was measured on a 16-channel CT system (16 Pro; GE Healthcare).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The CAC score was reported as an Agatston score using a 130 HU threshold (TeraRecon Aquarius Workstation, Foster City, CA).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Image analysis and quality control for both studies were performed at the same central reading center.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The minimum lesion size in AA-DHS was 0.52 mm2 and the minimum lesion size in the Jackson Heart Study was 1 mm2
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The robustness of the CAC score as an imaging biomarker across generations of CT scanners has been previously documented.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The calcium mass and traditional Agatston scores are two scales for measuring calcified plaque.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The mass score is calibrated on a per pixel basis to an external calibration phantom (Image Analysis, Columbia, KY) which reduces noise related to the method of quantification.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The Agatston score uses a threshold of 130 HU and calcified plaque below this cut-point even when present are grouped with the zero scores.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	This creates a group of false negatives by the design of the scoring system.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The calcium mass uses a threshold of 90 and minimizes the probability of a false negative result (increased sensitivity) with a modest reduction in specificity.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	In AA-DHS, the Pearson and Spearman correlations between the mass score and Agatston scores were 0.97 and 0.95, respectively.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	However, the interquartile ranges were 397 for the mass score and 180 Agatston score.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Therefore, the 90 HU CAC measure is better suited than 130 HU CAC to detect low CP levels in vascular beds.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Thus, the 90 HU measure coupled with the MASS scoring algorithm we employed are more sensitive for detecting calcified plaques and reduce noise in the scoring methods.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	This approach improved power for the CAC study outcome.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The 90 HU measure was only available in AA-DHS.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Therefore, we opted for a discovery approach which was conducted in AA-DHS using the 90 HU CAC measure as the outcome, followed by replication with the 130 HU CAC in JHS.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	In addition, two meta-analyses were performed.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The main meta-analysis used AA-DHS 90 HU CAC and 130 HU Jackson Heart Study CAC measures; the inverse variance meta-analysis was performed separately in the two studies using standardized coefficients.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	This approach controls for minor differences in test composition between studies (i.e., 90 HU vs 130 HU).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	For completeness, we also performed a second meta-analysis using the 130 HU CAC score in both study samples.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Results of both analyses are reported in Table 3 and Additional file 1: Table S4 for 90 HU in AA-DHS vs. 130 HU in JHS and 130 HU in both studies, respectively
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	DNA in AA-DHS participants was extracted from peripheral blood using the PureGene system (Gentra Systems, Minneapolis, MN).

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Genotypic data in both studies were imputed to 1000 Genomes (phase 1 version 3, cosmopolitan panel)
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Quality control (QC) checks were performed before conducting the GWAS.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	In AA-DHS, these checks led to the exclusion of twelve individuals from the analyses: 6 had call rates <90%, 2 had discordant self-reported and genetically determined sex, 1 had a heterozygosity score outside of the mean +- 4 times the standard error interval, 2 had the same sample identifiers and 1 had 100% European ancestry.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Genome-wide association analyses were performed on 691 individuals that met the QC inclusion criteria.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We used a classification scheme to rank SNPs and prioritize association results.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	This scheme was based on the estimated minor allele frequency (MAF), the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) p-value, and the call rate.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	All SNPs were analyzed; however, results are reported for common variants with a HWE p-value <=10-4 and a call rate >= 95%.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	SNPs with these qualifications also served as the basis for our imputation efforts.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	SNPs with a MAF between 1 and 5% that met the HWE p-value and call rate thresholds were also included in imputation.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Similar QC procedures were applied in JHS, which led to the exclusion of 2 subjects.

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Observed data at these SNPs were then combined with HapMap phase 3 genotypes obtained from Yoruban and CEPH samples; the HapMap samples were used as anchoring populations and were not included in the analysis.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The estimation process was repeated twice in AA-DHS, once with LAMP-ANC and once with HAPMIX.

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Local admixture estimation in JHS was performed with LAMP-ANC.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The global ancestry proportion estimates were obtained by averaging the local ancestry estimates across the genome.

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Imputation was performed using IMPUTE2 with phased haplotypic data obtained from Shapeit2.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The imputation effort used all SNPs that passed the QC filters.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Imputation was based on 3,436,913 and 733,318 autosomal SNPs in AA-DHS and JHS, respectively.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The multi-ethnic 1000 Genomes Phase I integrated variant set release (v3) was used as the reference panel.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Imputation was performed separately for each study.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Statistical analyses were performed on imputed SNPs that had certainty score above 90%, info score above 50% and MAF greater than 1%
0	NA	CAC + 1	NA	METHODS	Analyses were run using Log(CAC + 1) and CAC dichotomized (presence (CAC >= 10) vs. absence (CAC < 10)).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The value of 1 added to the observed CAC score allowed for the inclusion all subjects, even those with a CAC score of zero.
0	calcification	NA	NA	METHODS	This approach is justified based on the assumption that factors governing presence of CAC may differ from those influencing amount of CAC once calcification is initiated.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	METHODS	Age, gender, global African ancestry proportion, diabetes duration, hemoglobin A1c, body mass index, smoking status, and use of lipid-lowering medication were included as covariates in the model to test for association between each SNP and CAC.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Analyses were run separately in each study using the same outcome definitions based on the 90 HU CAC in AA-DHS and the 130 HU score in JHS.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	For the continuous outcome, linear mixed models were fitted using Genome-wide Efficient Mixed Model Analysis (GEMMA) software.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Generalized estimating equations were implemented to test for associations with the binary outcome.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	All analyses adjusted for familial relationships estimated using the Relatedness Estimation in Admixed Populations (REAP) software.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	SNPs were tested for association using the likelihood ratio test for the overall two degrees of freedom mode of inheritance model.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	If the overall test of association is significant, then the three a priori genetic models (dominant, additive, and recessive) were explored; the model with the best fit for each SNP was used.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Correction for this maximization was applied to account for the correlation between tests and to maintain the type 1 error rate.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	This approach is consistent with Fisher's protected least significant difference multiple comparison procedure.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Sample size weighted meta-analysis was performed to compare and combine results observed from each study.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Penalized regression with the L 1 norm (LASSO) was used to identify the SNP with the strongest effect size when LD caused several SNPs to display strong association with the outcome.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	A cross validation approach was used to determine the shrinkage parameter for each region.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	SNP selection was performed only in the AA-DHS subset, the larger of the two studies, to limit confounding effects.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Joint tests of association between local ancestry and genotypes with CAC were also were performed.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The model used for testing for association between local ancestry and CAC was similar to the one described for the genetic association tests, with local ancestry replacing the observed or imputed genotypes.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	If T L and T G denote the test statistics associated with the local ancestry and genotypic association with CAC, the joint test of association with local ancestry and genotype at each marker was calculated as , which follows a Chi-square distribution with 2 degrees of freedom.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	An alternative test based on the maximum of T G and T L was also computed, assuming these tests follow a bivariate normal distribution with a non-zero correlation.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The empirical correlation was computed using the variance-covariance matrix for 2 correlated score tests.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Results from these tests are shown in Additional file 2: Table S3
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The analysis involved more than 13 million directly genotyped and imputed SNPs.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	A strict Bonferroni correction would place the significance threshold at 1.9 x 10-9 for a two-sided test, a highly conservative threshold.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The sample sizes required to adequately power genetic association studies in AAs at this significance threshold are not feasible for a single study (or even two).
0	atherosclerotic	NA	NA	METHODS	These limitations are more pronounced when the focus is on atherosclerosis in the subset of this population with T2D.
0	atherosclerotic	NA	NA	METHODS	We prioritized meta-analysis association results that reached an adjusted p-value <=8.0 x 10-7, with a minimum adjusted p-value <=8.0 x 10-3 observed in each study and prior evidence of association of the gene with CAC, T2D and other factors involved in the atherosclerosis process.
0	atherosclerotic	NA	NA	METHODS	This approach combines statistical plausibility, with nominal statistical significance from both studies, and documented prior evidence that these genomic regions have been implicated in T2D and one or more processes leading to atherosclerosis.
