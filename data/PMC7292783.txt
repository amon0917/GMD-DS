0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	This sex difference is also observed after adjusting for BMI (Pmales_adjBMI=5.2x10-21, Pfemales_adjBMI=0.053).
0	NA	NA	rs12231737	RESULTS	Further, joint conditional analyses revealed two conditionally distinct signals (rs12231737, PGCTA=1.7x10-21; rs557597782, PGCTA=4.9x10-7) in males only.
1	NA	ALDH2	NA	RESULTS	ALDH2 encodes aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 family member, a key enzyme in alcohol metabolism that converts acetaldehyde into acetic acid.
0	flushing	NA	NA	RESULTS	This stretch of T2D associations in males reflects a long LD block that arose due to a recent selective sweep in East Asian individuals and results in flushing, nausea, and headache following alcohol consumption.
1	NA	ALDH2	rs12231737	RESULTS	The most significantly associated missense variant in moderate LD with rs12231737 (r2=0.68) was rs671 (ALDH2 Glu504Lys: RAF=77.7%, OR=1.17, 95% CI 1.14 - 1.20, Pmales=1.5x10-24), which leads to reduced ALDH2 activity and reduced alcohol metabolism, and has been associated with cardiometabolic traits in East Asian populations.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The T2D risk allele is associated with better tolerance for alcohol; increased BMI, blood pressure, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; and decreased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and cardiovascular risk.
0	NA	insulin	NA	RESULTS	The strong sexual dimorphism observed at this locus may be due to differences in alcohol consumption patterns between males and females, effects of alcohol on BMI, and/or differences in the effect of alcohol on insulin sensitivity
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	With an effective sample size comparable to the largest study of T2D in European individuals (East Asian Neff=211,793; European Neff = 231,436) and imputation to a dense 1000 Genomes reference panel, our results provide the most comprehensive and precise catalogue of East Asian T2D effects to date for comparisons across ancestries (Figure 2; Supplementary Table 7).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	For 183 EAS T2D loci and 231 EUR T2D loci (unadjusted for BMI), we compared the per-allele effect sizes for the 332 variants available in both datasets (i.e.

0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Overall, the per-allele effect sizes between the two ancestries were moderately correlated (r=0.55; Figure 2A).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	When the comparison was restricted to the 278 variants that are common (MAF>=5%) in both ancestries, the effect size correlation increased to r=0.59 (Figure 2B; Extended Data Figure 7).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	This effect size correlation further increased to r=0.87 for 106 variants significantly associated with T2D (P<5x10-8) in both ancestries.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Based on Cochran's heterogeneity test, 28 of 332 variants (8.4%) exhibited significant heterogeneity in effect sizes between East Asian and European populations, including 22 that were significant in only one population (Supplementary Table 7) and six with larger effect sizes in one population (e.g.
0	NA	CDKAL1	NA	RESULTS	CDKAL1, KCNQ1, and HNF1B).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	While the overall effect sizes for all 332 variants appear, on average, to be stronger in East Asian individuals than European individuals, this trend is reduced when each locus is represented only by the lead variant from one population (Extended Data Figure 8).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Specifically, 39 variants identified in the European meta-analysis with imputation using the Haplotype Reference Consortium panel are missing from the comparison because they were rare/monomorphic or poorly imputed in the East Asian meta-analysis, with imputation based on the smaller and more heterogenous 1000 Genomes reference panel
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Variants exhibiting the largest differences in effect sizes across ancestries are generally rare (MAF <=0.1%) in European populations but common (e.g.

0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Within the East Asian meta-analysis, the direction of effect is consistent across East Asian countries (Extended Data Figure 9B) and within the contributing cohorts (Extended Data Figure 9C).
