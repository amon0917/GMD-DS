0	Type 2 diabetes	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	To further understanding of the genetic basis of type 2 diabetes (T2D) susceptibility, we aggregated published meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) including 26,488 cases and 83,964 controls of European, East Asian, South Asian, and Mexican and Mexican American ancestry.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	We observed significant excess in directional consistency of T2D risk alleles across ancestry groups, even at SNPs demonstrating only weak evidence of association.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	By following up the strongest signals of association from the trans-ethnic meta-analysis in an additional 21,491 cases and 55,647 controls of European ancestry, we identified seven novel T2D susceptibility loci.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Furthermore, we observed considerable improvements in fine-mapping resolution of common variant association signals at several T2D susceptibility loci.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	These observations highlight the benefits of trans-ethnic GWAS for the discovery and characterisation of complex trait loci, and emphasize an exciting opportunity to extend insight into the genetic architecture and pathogenesis of human diseases across populations of diverse ancestry
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The majority of GWAS of T2D susceptibility have been undertaken in populations of European ancestry, predominantly because of existing infrastructure, sample availability, and relatively poor coverage by many of the earliest genome-wide genotyping arrays of common genetic variation in other major ethnic groups.
0	insufficient	NA	NA	INTRO	However, European ancestry populations constitute only a subset of human genetic variation, and thus are insufficient to fully characterise T2D risk variants in other ethnic groups.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Furthermore, the latest genome-wide genotyping arrays are less biased towards Europeans, and more recent T2D GWAS have been performed, with great success, in populations from other ancestry groups, including East Asians, South Asians, Mexicans and Mexican Americans, and African Americans.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	These studies have provided initial evidence of overlap in T2D susceptibility loci between ancestry groups and for coincident risk alleles at lead SNPs across diverse populations.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	These observations are consistent with a model in which the underlying causal variants at many of these loci are shared across ancestry groups, and thus arose prior to human population migration out of Africa.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Under such a model, we would expect to improve power to detect novel susceptibility loci for the disease, and enhance fine-mapping resolution of causal variants, by combining GWAS across ancestry groups through trans-ethnic meta-analysis, because of increased sample size and differences in the structure of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between such diverse populations
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In this study, we aggregated published meta-analyses of GWAS in a total of 26,488 cases and 83,964 controls from populations of European, East Asian, South Asian, and Mexican and Mexican American ancestry.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	T2D GWAS from populations of African ancestry, which would be expected to provide the greatest potential for fine-mapping of common causal variants due to less extensive LD than other ethnic groups, were not accessible for inclusion in our analyses.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	With these data, we aimed to: (i) assess the evidence for excess concordance in the direction of effect of T2D risk alleles across ancestry groups; (ii) identify novel T2D susceptibility loci through trans-ethnic meta-analysis and subsequent validation in an additional 21,491 cases and 55,647 controls of European ancestry; and (iii) evaluate the improvements in the fine-mapping resolution of common variant association signals in established T2D susceptibility loci through trans-ethnic meta-analysis, despite the lack of GWAS from populations of African ancestry
0	diabetes	NA	NA	RESULTS	We considered published meta-analyses of GWAS of T2D susceptibility from four major ethnic groups (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2), undertaken by: (i) the DIAbetes Genetics Replication and Meta-analysis (DIAGRAM) Consortium (European ancestry; 12,171 cases and 56,862 controls); (ii) the Asian Genetic Epidemiology Network T2D (AGEN-T2D) Consortium (East Asian ancestry; 6,952 cases and 11,865 controls); (iii) the South Asian T2D (SAT2D) Consortium (South Asian ancestry; 5,561 cases and 14,458 controls); and (iv) the Mexican American T2D (MAT2D) Consortium (Mexican and Mexican American ancestry; 1,804 cases and 779 controls).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We obtained association summary statistics from the four available ethnic-specific meta-analyses, each imputed at up to 2.5 million autosomal SNPs from Phase II/III HapMap to provide a uniform catalogue of common genetic variation, defined by minor allele frequency (MAF) of at least 5%, across ancestry groups (Online Methods).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	These association summary statistics were then combined across ancestry groups via trans-ethnic fixed-effects meta-analysis (Online Methods)
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We began by evaluating heterogeneity in allelic effects (i.e.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	discordance in the direction and/or magnitude of odds-ratios) between ancestry groups at 69 established autosomal T2D susceptibility loci.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We assessed the evidence for heterogeneity at previously reported lead SNPs on the basis of Cochran's Q-statistic from the trans-ethnic meta-analysis (Online Methods, Supplementary Table 3).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We observed nominal evidence of heterogeneity (Bonferroni correction, pQ<0.05/69=0.00072) at the previously reported lead SNP at just three loci.
1	NA	TCF7L2	rs7903146	RESULTS	At TCF7L2 (rs7903146, pQ=0.00055), the odds-ratio is largest in European ancestry populations, although the risk allele has a consistent direction of effect across ethnicities.
0	NA	PEPD	rs3786897	RESULTS	At PEPD (rs3786897, pQ=0.00055) and KLF14 (rs13233731, pQ=0.00064), however, the association signals are apparently specific to East Asian and European ancestry populations, respectively, despite the fact that the reported lead SNPs are common in all ethnic groups.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We also observed that, at 52 previously reported lead SNPs passing quality control in each of the four ethnic-specific meta-analyses, 34 showed the same direction of effect across all ancestry groups (65.4%, compared with 12.5% expected by chance, binomial test p<2.2x10-16).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	"The strong evidence of homogeneity in allelic effects across ancestry groups at the majority of previously reported lead SNPs argues against the ""synthetic association"" hypothesis."
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	It is improbable that GWAS signals at most established T2D susceptibility loci reflect unobserved lower frequency causal alleles with larger effects because: (i) rare variants are unlikely to have arisen before human population migration out of Africa and thus are not expected to be widely shared across diverse populations; and (ii) patterns of LD with these variants are anticipated to be highly variable between ethnicities
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	To gain insights into the potential for the discovery of novel T2D susceptibility loci through fixed-effects trans-ethnic meta-analysis, we next assessed the genome-wide coincidence of risk alleles (i.e.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	direction of effect) across ancestry groups after exclusion of the 69 established autosomal GWAS signals, defined as mapping within 500kb of the previously reported lead SNPs (Online Methods).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	First, we identified independent SNPs (separated by at least 500kb) with nominal evidence of association (p<=0.001) with T2D from the European ancestry meta-analysis.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	By aligning the effect of the T2D risk allele from the European meta-analysis into the other ancestry groups, we observed evidence of significant excess in directional concordance between ethnicities: 57.0% with East Asian populations (binomial test p=0.0077); 55.4% with South Asian populations (binomial test p=0.032); and 56.6% with Mexican and Mexican American populations (binomial test p=0.010).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Using the same approach, we also observed excess consistency in the direction of effect between ethnicities at independent SNPs demonstrating weaker evidence of T2D association (0.001<p<=0.01) from the European meta-analysis (Table 1).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	In contrast, when we considered independent SNPs with no evidence of association (p>0.5) with T2D, there was no enrichment in coincident risk alleles across ethnic groups.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We repeated this analysis by identifying T2D risk alleles at SNPs with nominal evidence of association in East Asian, South Asian, and Mexican and Mexican American meta-analyses, in turn, and assessing concordance in the direction of effect in each of the other ancestry groups (Supplementary Table 4).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The evidence for an excess in concordance between T2D risk alleles across ethnicities was not as strong, particularly for the Mexican and Mexican American meta-analysis.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	However, this presumably reflects reduced power due to smaller sample sizes, and there was still significant over representation of alleles with the same direction of effect across ancestry groups at SNPs with nominal evidence of association with the disease
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The observations from our concordance analyses are consistent with a long tail of common T2D susceptibility variants, with effects which are decreasing in magnitude, but which are homogeneous across ancestry groups.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Under such a model, we would expect these variants to be amenable to discovery via trans-ethnic fixed-effects meta-analyses.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	In this study, by aggregating the published ethnic-specific meta-analyses under a fixed-effects model, we identified 33 independent SNPs (separated by at least 500kb) with suggestive evidence of association (p<10-5) at loci not previously reported for T2D susceptibility in any ancestry group (Supplementary Table 5, Supplementary Figure 1).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	By convention, we have labelled loci according to the gene nearest to the lead SNP, unless a compelling biological candidate mapped nearby.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	It is essential to validate partially imputed association signals with direct genotyping.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Consequently, we carried forward these 33 loci for in silico follow-up in a meta-analysis of an additional 21,491 T2D cases and 55,647 controls of European ancestry, genotyped with the Metabochip (Online Methods, Supplementary Tables 1 and 2).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	This custom array was designed to facilitate cost-effective replication of nominal associations for T2D and other metabolic and cardiovascular traits.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	However, it provides relatively limited coverage of common genetic variation, genome-wide, with the result that the lead SNPs, or close proxies (CEU r2>0.6 from Phase II HapMap), were present at just 24 of the loci.
1	NA	NA	rs9505118	RESULTS	We also identified poorer proxies at two additional loci, rs9505118 (SSR1/RREB1, CEU r2=0.26, p=1.9x10-6) and rs4275659 (MPHOSPH9, CEU r2=0.48, p=5.5x10-6), which, nonetheless, demonstrated only marginally weaker association signals than the lead SNPs (SSR1/RREB1, rs9502570, p=5.7x10-7; MPHOSPH9, rs1727313, p=1.2x10-6).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Given that these variants met our threshold for follow-up from the trans-ethnic meta-analysis, they were also considered for validation
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	"By combining association summary statistics from the trans-ethnic ""discovery"" and European ancestry ""validation"" meta-analyses, SNPs achieved genome-wide significance (combined meta-analysis p<5x10-8) at seven loci (Table 2, Figure 1)."
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We observed no evidence of heterogeneity in allelic effects between discovery and validation stages of the combined meta-analysis (Supplementary Table 5).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	As expected, the novel loci are characterised by lead SNPs that are relatively common in all ethnicities, and have modest effects on T2D susceptibility which are homogeneous across ancestry groups (Supplementary Table 6).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Adjustments for covariates were not harmonised within or between consortia because of variation in individual study design and recorded non-genetic risk factors.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	However, we observed no evidence of heterogeneity in allelic effects in the European ancestry validation meta-analysis after stratification of studies according to covariate adjustment (Online Methods, Supplementary Table 7).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	These data thus provide no evidence of bias in allelic effect estimates at lead SNPs at the novel loci, and suggest our results to be robust to variability in correction for potential confounders across studies
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The novel loci include SNPs mapping near POU5F1/TCF19 in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), a region of the genome that is essential to immune response.
0	insulin-treated diabetes	NA	NA	RESULTS	The MHC harbours HLA class II genes, which together account for approximately half the genetic risk to type 1 diabetes (T1D).
0	NA	NA	rs660895	RESULTS	We observed no evidence of association of T2D with tags for traditional T1D HLA risk alleles in the trans-ethnic meta-analysis: HLA-DR4 (rs660895, p=0.32) and HLA-DR3 (rs2187668, p=0.34).
0	NA	GLIS3	rs9268645	RESULTS	Furthermore, when we considered lead SNPs at 49 T1D susceptibility loci (Supplementary Table 8), we observed nominal evidence of association (p<0.05) with T2D, with the same risk allele for both diseases, at just two (GLIS3 and 6q22.32), but not at that mapping to the MHC (rs9268645, p=0.33).
0	insulin-treated diabetes	NA	NA	RESULTS	There is very strong evidence that T1D-risk variants, particularly in the MHC, are also associated with latent autoimmune diabetes of adulthood (LADA), a late-age onset, more indolent form of the disease, which often results in a clinical misdiagnosis of T2D.
0	insulin-treated diabetes	NA	NA	RESULTS	Although studies contributing to the trans-ethnic meta-analysis differed in the degree to which they were able to exclude LADA cases, the lack of association of T1D-risk variants suggests that rates of diagnostic misclassification of autoimmune diabetes were too modest to drive the T2D GWAS signal at the POU5F1/TCF19 locus
1	NA	ARL15	NA	RESULTS	The novel loci also include SNPs mapping to ARL15 and SSR1/RREB1, which have been previously implicated, at genome-wide significance, in regulation of fasting insulin (FI) and fasting glucose (FG), respectively.
1	NA	ARL15	rs702634	RESULTS	The lead SNPs for T2D (rs702634) and FI (rs4865796) mapping to ARL15 are closely correlated in European and East Asian ancestry populations (CEU r2=1.00 and CHB+JPT r2=0.87 from Phase II HapMap).
1	NA	NA	rs9505118	RESULTS	However, the lead T2D SNP (rs9505118) is independent of that for FG (rs17762454) at the SSR1/RREB1 locus (CEU and CHB+JPT r2<0.05).
1	NA	ARL15	rs4311394	RESULTS	The ARL15 locus has also been associated with circulating adiponectin levels, an adipocyte-secreted protein that has anti-diabetic effects, but the lead SNP (rs4311394) is independent of that for T2D susceptibility from the trans-ethnic meta-analysis
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	To obtain a more comprehensive view of the overlap of novel T2D susceptibility loci with metabolic phenotypes, we interrogated published European ancestry meta-analyses from the Meta-Analysis of Glycaemic and Insulin-related Consortium (MAGIC) Investigators, the Genetic Investigation of ANthropometric Traits (GIANT) Consortium and the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium, to evaluate the effect of T2D risk alleles on: glycaemic traits, including homeostatic model of assessment indices of beta-cell function (HOMA-B) and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR); anthropometric measures; and plasma lipid concentrations (Online Methods, Supplementary Tables 9, 10 and 11).
1	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	T2D risk alleles at SSR1/RREB1 and LPP have features that indicate a primary role on susceptibility through beta-cell dysfunction: increased FG (p=1.0x10-5 and p=8.6x10-7, respectively), and reduced HOMA-B (p=0.11 and p=0.011, respectively).
1	NA	ARL15	NA	RESULTS	Conversely, the T2D risk allele mapping to ARL15 is associated with increased FI, most strongly after adjustment for body-mass index (BMI) (p=5.0x10-12), and increased HOMA-IR (p=0.021), and is thus more characteristic of action through insulin resistance.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	This risk allele is also associated with reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p=0.022) and increased triglycerides (p=0.010), as expected, but also with reduced BMI (p=5.6x10-5)
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	To identify the most promising functional candidate transcripts amongst those mapping to the novel susceptibility loci, we interrogated public databases and unpublished resources for expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) from a variety of tissues (Online Methods).
1	NA	SSR1	NA	RESULTS	The lead T2D SNPs at three loci showed nominal association (p<10-5) with expression, and were in strong LD (CEU and CHB+JPT r2>0.8) with the reported cis-eQTL variant: SSR1 (B cells, p=2.2x10-6) at the SSR1/RREB1 locus; ABCB9 (liver, p=7.4x10-12) and SETD8 (lung, p<2.0x10-16) at the MPHOSPH9 locus; and HCG27 (monocytes, p=1.3x10-69) at the POU5F1/TCF19 locus (Supplementary Table 12)
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We also evaluated novel loci for potential functional mechanisms underlying T2D susceptibility (Online Methods).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We identified variants in pilot data from the 1000 Genomes Project that are in strong LD (CEU and CHB+JPT r2>0.8) with the lead SNPs in the seven novel susceptibility loci for functional annotation.
0	NA	NA	rs113581344	RESULTS	We identified a missense variant at the POU5F1/TCF19 locus in TCF19 (rs113581344, V211M; CEU r2=0.96 and CHB+JPT r2=0.80 with lead SNP rs3130501), although it is predicted to be tolerated by SIFT (Supplementary Table 13).
1	NA	SSR1	NA	RESULTS	Lead SNPs in the novel susceptibility loci were also in strong LD with variants in the untranslated regions of SSR1 (at the SSR1/RREB1 locus) and ABCB9, OGFOD2, and PITPNM2 (at the MPHOSPH9 locus).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Variants in strong LD with the lead SNPs at two of the novel susceptibility loci overlap regions of predicted regulatory function generated by the ENCODE Project (Supplementary Figure 2).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The lead SNP at the LPP locus maps to an enhancer region which is active in HepG2 cells.
1	pancreatic	FAF1	rs58836765	RESULTS	We also identified a variant at the FAF1 locus (rs58836765; CEU r2=0.89 and CHB+JPT r2=0.80 with lead SNP rs17106184) which overlaps a region of open chromatin activity in pancreatic islets and other cell types.
1	pancreatic	ELAVL4	NA	RESULTS	This open chromatin site is in a region correlated with expression of ELAVL4, which has been demonstrated to regulate insulin translation in pancreatic beta cells, highlighting this transcript as a credible candidate at the FAF1 locus.
0	pancreatic	NA	NA	RESULTS	Regulatory annotations in HepG2 cells and pancreatic islets are both broadly enriched at T2D associated variants, and are thus supportive of these functional mechanisms for causal variant activity at both loci
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Given our observation that the causal variants underlying GWAS signals are shared across ancestry groups at many T2D susceptibility loci, we evaluated the evidence for improved fine-mapping resolution through trans-ethnic meta-analysis.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	For this purpose, we combined association summary statistics from the ethnic-specific meta-analyses using MANTRA.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	This Bayesian approach has the advantage of allowing for heterogeneity in allelic odds-ratios between ancestry groups, arising as a result of differential patterns of LD with a shared underlying causal variant across diverse populations, which cannot be accommodated in fixed-effects meta-analysis (Online Methods).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Simulation studies have demonstrated improved detection and localisation of causal variants through trans-ethnic meta-analysis with MANTRA compared to either a fixed- or random-effects model
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	"Within each locus, we constructed ""credible sets"" of SNPs that are most likely to be causal based on their statistical evidence of association from the MANTRA meta-analysis."
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Credible sets can be interpreted in a similar way to confidence intervals in a frequentist statistical framework.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	For example, assuming that a locus harbours a single causal variant that is reported in the meta-analysis, the probability that it will be contained in the 99% credible set is 0.99.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Smaller credible sets, in terms of the number of SNPs they contain, or the genomic interval they cover, thus correspond to fine-mapping at higher resolution.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	It is essential that SNP coverage is as uniform as possible across studies in the construction of credible sets.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Otherwise, differences in association signals between variants may reflect variability in sample sizes in the meta-analysis, and not true differences in magnitude of effects on T2D susceptibility.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Consequently, we have not considered the European ancestry Metabochip validation studies in our fine-mapping analyses because SNP density on the array is too sparse, across the majority of T2D susceptibility loci, to allow high-quality imputation up to the Phase II/III HapMap reference panels utilised in the trans-ethnic discovery GWAS
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	In constructing credible sets, we assume that there is a single causal variant at each locus.
0	NA	CDKN2A	NA	RESULTS	"However, there is increasing evidence that multiple association signals, typically characterised by independent common ""index"" SNPs, are relatively widespread at T2D susceptibility loci, for example CDKN2A/B and KCNQ16."
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Fine-mapping of these independent association signals will require formal conditioning, adjusting for genotypes at each index SNP in turn, before construction of the credible set for each underlying causal variant.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Approximate conditioning, without formal computation, as implemented in GCTA, makes use of meta-analysis summary statistics and a reference panel to approximate LD between SNPs (and hence correlation between parameter estimates in a joint association model).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Unfortunately, this approach is not feasible in a trans-ethnic context because of differences in LD structure between ancestry groups, and thus could not be applied in this study.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Consequently, the credible sets defined here correspond to fine-mapping across association signals at each locus
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	To assess the improvements in fine-mapping resolution by combining GWAS from diverse populations, we compared the properties of the MANTRA 99% credible set on the basis of association summary statistics from: (i) the European ancestry only meta-analysis; and (ii) the trans-ethnic meta-analysis of European, East Asian, South Asian, and Mexican and Mexican American ancestry groups.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We focussed on ten autosomal loci (of the 69 previously established) that attained association with T2D susceptibility at genome-wide significance in the European ancestry meta-analysis (Table 3).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We did not consider loci with weaker signals of association since they were typically characterised by large 99% credible sets in the European ancestry meta-analysis, and thus might provide an over-estimate of the improvement in fine-mapping resolution by combining GWAS across ancestry groups.
0	NA	MTNR1B	NA	RESULTS	Of the loci considered, only at MTNR1B, did we not see any improvement in fine-mapping resolution, in terms of the number of SNPs and the genomic interval covered by the 99% credible set after trans-ethnic meta-analysis
0	NA	JAZF1	NA	RESULTS	The greatest enhancement in fine-mapping resolution after trans-ethnic meta-analysis was observed at the JAZF1 locus, where the genomic interval covered by the 99% credible set was reduced from 76kb to just 16kb (Figure 2, Supplementary Figure 3).
0	NA	NA	rs864745	RESULTS	Of the nine variants in the European 99% credible set, five were excluded after trans-ethnic meta-analysis because of low LD with the lead SNP at this locus in East Asian ancestry populations (CHB+JPT r2<0.05 with rs864745).
0	NA	NA	rs1635852	RESULTS	Amongst the variants retained in the 99% credible set after trans-ethnic meta-analysis, interrogation of predicted regulatory function from the ENCODE Project revealed that rs1635852 maps to a region of open chromatin with enhancer activity, bound by several transcription factors.
0	pancreatic	CREB5	NA	RESULTS	This SNP has been previously shown to have allelic differences in pancreatic islet enhancer activity, and is also correlated with expression of CREB5, highlighting this transcript as a credible candidate at the JAZF1 locus
0	NA	SLC30A8	NA	RESULTS	We also observed a substantial reduction in the genomic interval covered by the credible set at the SLC30A8 locus (Figure 2, Supplementary Figure 3), from 35kb (four SNPs) on the basis of only European ancestry GWAS, to less than 1kb (two SNPs) after trans-ethnic meta-analysis.
0	NA	NA	rs13266634	RESULTS	However, the lead SNP is strongly correlated with all variants in the credible set before trans-ethnic meta-analysis in both European and East Asian ancestry groups (CEU and CHB+JPT r2>=0.8 with rs13266634), suggesting that the improved fine-mapping resolution at this locus is more likely due to increased sample size than differences in LD structure between the populations.
0	NA	NA	rs13266634	RESULTS	Encouragingly, the lead SNP after trans-ethnic meta-analysis is more clearly separated from others in the credible set, and is a non-synonymous variant, R325W, which plays an established functional role in T2D susceptibility
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Finally, we tested variants present in the 99% credible sets at the ten loci, on the basis of only the European ancestry GWAS and the trans-ethnic meta-analysis, for enrichment of functional annotation compared to randomly shifted element locations (Online Methods).
0	allergy	NA	NA	RESULTS	Variants in the trans-ethnic 99% credible sets were significantly enriched (empirical p<0.05) for overlap with DNaseI hypersensitive sites (DHS p=0.038) and transcription factor binding sites (TFBS p=0.0060).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	However, no such enrichment in either annotation category was observed for the European ancestry 99% credible sets (DHS p=0.18; TFBS p=0.087).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	These data suggest that variants retained after trans-ethnic meta-analysis show greater potential for functional impact on T2D susceptibility through these regulatory mechanisms
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The fine-mapping intervals defined by credible sets after trans-ethnic meta-analysis are limited by the density and allele frequency spectrum of the GWAS genotyping arrays and HapMap reference panels used for imputation.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Although these reference panels provide comprehensive coverage of common SNPs (MAF>5%) across ancestry groups, imputation up to phased haplotypes from the 1000 Genomes Project, for example, would allow assessment of the impact of lower frequency variation on T2D susceptibility in diverse populations.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	However, we have demonstrated that, for a fixed reference panel, trans-ethnic meta-analysis can improve localisation of common causal SNPs within established T2D susceptibility loci, and have identified highly annotated variants within fine-mapping intervals defined by the 99% credible sets.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We have also assessed the sensitivity of the trans-ethnic fine-mapping analysis to genotype quality at directly typed or imputed SNPs (Supplementary Table 14).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We repeated MANTRA fine-mapping with subsets of SNPs that pass quality control in at least 80% (N=88,361) or 90% (N=99,406) of individuals from the trans-ethnic meta-analysis.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	As the threshold for reported sample size increased, the number of SNPs included in the fine-mapping analysis was reduced, but the genomic intervals covered by the 99% credible sets remained unchanged, suggesting resolution to be relatively robust to genotype quality at common variants
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We have identified seven novel loci for T2D susceptibility at genome-wide significance by combining GWAS from multiple ancestry groups.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	"Our study has provided evidence of many more common variant loci, not yet reaching genome-wide significance, which contribute to the ""missing heritability"" of T2D susceptibility, in agreement with polygenic analyses in European ancestry GWAS."
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The effects of these common variants are modest, but homogeneous across ancestry groups, and thus would be amenable to discovery through trans-ethnic meta-analysis in larger samples.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We have also demonstrated improvements in the resolution of fine-mapping of common variant association signals through trans-ethnic meta-analysis, even in the absence of GWAS of African ancestry, which would be expected to better refine localisation due to reduced LD in these populations.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Future releases of reference panels from the 1000 Genomes Project are anticipated to include 2,500 samples, including haplotypes of South Asian ancestry and wider representation of African descent populations.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This panel will provide a comprehensive catalogue of genetic variation with MAF as low as 0.5%, as well as many rarer variants, across major ancestry groups, thus facilitating imputation and coverage of loci for future trans-ethnic fine-mapping efforts
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our analyses clearly highlight the benefits of combining GWAS from multiple ancestry groups for discovery and characterisation of common variant loci contributing to complex traits, and emphasise an exciting opportunity to further our understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying human diseases across populations from diverse ethnicities
