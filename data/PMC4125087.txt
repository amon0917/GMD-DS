0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Since the causal variant(s) at each locus may be different or reside on different haplotypes across populations with different LD structures, this approach allows the identification of the most strongly associated SNPs in African Americans that may or may not be in LD with the index SNPs reported in other populations.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	A total of 55 T2D- and 29 glucose-associated loci were associated with T2D in African Americans (Plocus<0.05, corrected for LD in ASW for SNPs within a locus; Table S6).
