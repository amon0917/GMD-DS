0	Type 2 diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	Type 2 diabetes is a cause of poor health and early death that is spreading worldwide and exerting a fearsome human and economic toll.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	Prevention and control of diabetes requires a better understanding of its basic molecular causes.
0	Type 2 diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	Type 2 diabetes is a heterogeneous disease arising from physiological dysfunction in the pancreas, skeletal muscle, liver, adipose and vascular tissue.
0	Type 2 diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	Much of the heterogeneity of type 2 diabetes has a genetic basis.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	A full picture of the complex genetic architecture of diabetes has been elusive
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	Among type 2 diabetes susceptibility genes few, if any, individual loci are expected to carry alleles of major effect explaining a substantial proportion of cases, although a few genes could have a substantial population effect but not give a strong genetic signal if the causal alleles were common and the increase in risk were modest.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Such genes have proven hard to detect using linkage-based approaches, although recent rapid advances in genetic association methodologies have led to some successes.
0	diabetes	PPARG	rs1801282	INTRO	The P12A polymorphism in the gene encoding the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-g (PPARG), the E23K polymorphism in the gene encoding the islet ATP-dependent potassium channel Kir6.2 (ABCC8-KCNJ11) and common variants in the gene encoding the transcription factor 7-like 2 gene (TCF7L2) were all found using well-powered association mapping, and all have been reproducibly associated with diabetes in diverse samples at highly significant p-values
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Current gene discovery strategies have focused on coding regions, but regulatory variants also influence disease.

0	NA	insulin	NA	METHODS	In this presentation we focus on six (three glucose and three insulin) primary Offspring diabetes-related quantitative traits.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Glucose traits are fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) measured at exam 5, and up to 28 yr time-averaged FPG (tFPG) level obtained from the mean of up to seven serial exams.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	METHODS	Glucose traits included all subjects, including those with diabetes regardless of treatment, as these were the most informative subjects with respect to hyperglycemia.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	METHODS	Subjects with diabetes had the highest glucose values when subjects were ranked with respect to any glucose trait; those on treatment had the highest values.
0	NA	insulin	NA	METHODS	The three insulin traits are fasting insulin, homeostasis model-assessed insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and Gutt's 0-120 min insulin sensitivity index (ISI_0-120) measured at exam 5.
0	insulin-treated diabetes	insulin	NA	METHODS	Subjects with insulin-treated diabetes were removed from all insulin trait analyses, as we had no information on insulin dose and so measured insulin values were confounded by insulin treatment.

0	diabetes	NA	NA	METHODS	We used two approaches to prioritize SNPs potentially associated with diabetes or diabetes related traits.
0	NA	insulin	NA	METHODS	In the first, we simply ordered SNPs from lowest to highest p-value for association with one or more of the six primary glucose and insulin traits.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We also ordered SNPs or Marshfield STRS by highest to lowest LOD score for linkage to one or more of the six primary traits, and present LOD scores > 2.0.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	In an alternative SNP prioritization strategy, we selected SNPs associated with multiple-related traits.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	In this approach, we selected SNPs with consistent nominal associations (p < 0.01 in GEE or FBAT) with all three glucose traits OR all three insulin-related traits OR (two glucose and two insulin traits).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Among these we used extent of LD to select a non-redundant set of SNPs; when several were perfect proxies for each other (r2 >= 0.8) only one SNP was selected, based on the highest genotyping call rate
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The general statistical methods for linkage and GWA analyses are described in the Overview Methods .
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	For diabetes-related quantitative traits we used additive GEE and FBAT models, testing associations between SNP genotypes and age-age2-sex-adjusted residual trait values.

0	diabetes	NA	NA	METHODS	We tested association of 100K SNPs with incident type 2 diabetes in two additional models using the same adjustment strategy.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	METHODS	First, Martingale residuals were created to measure the age-of-onset of type 2 diabetes; residuals were analyzed with FBAT.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	METHODS	Individuals with lower values of this 'martingale residual' trait developed diabetes at younger ages, and those with the highest values had been observed for the longest time without development of diabetes.
0	diabetes	Cox	NA	METHODS	Second, we used a Cox proportional hazard survival analysis with robust covariance estimates in order to find SNPs associated with development of diabetes over all seven exams
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Diabetes-related quantitative traits available in the FHS 100K SNP resource are listed in Table 1 and posted on the NCBI web site.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Each trait is available as an age-age2-adjusted or age-age2-BMI-adjusted residuals from sex-specific models.

0	NA	MAF	NA	RESULTS	The six primary quantitative traits had significant associations with 415 SNPs in GEE models and 242 SNPs in FBAT models, using p-value < 0.001, and only considering SNPs with call rate >= 0.80, HWE p-value >= 0.001, and MAF >= 10%.

0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We used a multiple-related trait approach in a strategy different from prioritizing SNPs based solely on small p-values.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	This approach yielded 203 SNPs associated with multiple traits.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	RESULTS	Of these, 53 were also associated with incident diabetes (p < 0.01 by GEE or FBAT).
0	diabetes	NA	NA	RESULTS	We defined redundant SNPs as those in LD with r2 >= 0.80 to select 168 non-redundant SNPs associated with multiple traits; 42 of these non-redundant SNPs also were associated with incident diabetes (Table 3).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Examination of the multiple trait-based approach revealed 1) consistent associations of traits with SNPs that were in LD (providing reassurance that the signal was due to an association of traits with a particular genomic region rather than to technical error); 2) several putative associations of traits with SNPs in the same gene but not in perfect LD (suggesting that the association signal may be due to a functional role of that gene rather than a statistical fluctuation); and 3) associations of traits with SNPs in a variety of novel but plausible biological candidate genes
