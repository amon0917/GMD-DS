1	NA	insulin	rs6723108	RESULTS	The risk allele of rs6723108 was associated with decrease in fasting plasma insulin (beta= -5.71 pmol/L; P = 3.7 x 10-3) and HOMA-IR (beta= -0.21; P = 7.4 x 10-3) in Indo-Europeans (Supplementary Table 8).
0	NA	insulin	rs998451	RESULTS	Similarly, rs998451 was also associated with decrease in fasting plasma insulin (beta= -5.54 pmol/L; P = 0.02) and HOMA-IR (beta= -0.20; P = 0.04).
0	insulin deficiency	TMEM163	NA	RESULTS	This suggests that TMEM163 variants might modulate T2D susceptibility by affecting insulin secretion.
1	NA	RAB3GAP1	rs6723108	RESULTS	Previous studies have shown that at this 2q21 region, rs6723108 and a variant in RAB3GAP1 (rs6730157) are associated with waist circumference (P = 6.2 x 10-5) and total cholesterol (P = 8.5 x 10-8), respectively.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	However, variants from this locus were not associated with these traits in our study, which could be due to the small effect size of these variants for these traits in the current study population or lower power of the current study to detect them
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	GWAS has enormously contributed to the identification of susceptibility genes for T2D and many other complex disorders.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The discovery of new susceptibility loci in GWAS of different ethnic groups emphasizes the need for conducting more GWAS in populations of diverse ethnic groups.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our study also shows the potential of identifying new signals through GWAS in population of different ethnicity.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In this study, we performed a GWAS in Indians and identified a new signal for T2D on chromosome 2q21
0	NA	TMEM163	NA	DISCUSS	The strongest signal on newly identified locus 2q21 mapped to TMEM163.
1	insulin deficiency	TMEM163	rs6723108	DISCUSS	The association of TMEM163 variants (rs6723108 and rs998451) with reduced fasting plasma insulin levels and HOMA-IR indicates that it might modulate susceptibility to T2D by affecting insulin secretion.
1	NA	NA	rs6723108	DISCUSS	Previously, rs6723108 has also been suggested to be associated with waist circumference.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	These data indicate the biological relevance of the identified locus with T2D.
0	NA	TMEM163	NA	DISCUSS	TMEM163 encodes a synaptic vesicle membrane protein with six putative transmembrane helices that may function as a vesicular transporter.
0	NA	TMEM163	NA	DISCUSS	TMEM163 is expressed in select brain regions and contained in subpopulations of nerve terminals.
0	Neurological and Communication Disorders	RAB3GAP1	NA	DISCUSS	This region also harbors RAB3GAP1 and ACMSD, which are shown to be involved in neurologic disorders.
0	NA	RAB3GAP1	NA	DISCUSS	RAB3GAP1 encodes a catalytic subunit of a Rab GTPase-activating protein involved in regulated exocytosis of neurotransmitters and hormones.
0	neurodevelopmental abnormalities	RAB3GAP1	NA	DISCUSS	Mutations in RAB3GAP1 are associated with neurodevelopmental abnormalities known as Warburg micro syndrome (OMIM 600118).
0	NA	ACMSD	NA	DISCUSS	ACMSD codes for an enzyme involved in picolinic and quinolinic acid homeostasis and NAD biosynthesis.
0	diabetes	ACMSD	NA	DISCUSS	ACMSD activity and expression have been shown to be elevated in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats and suppressed by insulin injection and is suggested as a potential therapeutic avenue for diabetes treatment.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Thus, our results suggest the involvement of neurologic component in the etiology of T2D, which needs to be confirmed through further investigations
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The signal on 2q21 observed in Indo-Europeans was not detected in Dravidians and Europeans from DIAGRAM+.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The observed differences in association results might be due to differences in allele frequencies and LD structures or statistical power to detect the association.
1	NA	NA	rs6723108	DISCUSS	In Dravidians, the minor allele frequency of the index variant rs6723108 is very low (0.03) and differs significantly from that of Indo-Europeans, and hence, to capture the association of this variant, if any, a larger sample size is required.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Thus, the statistical power of the Dravidian study population might not be sufficient to detect the observed association in Indo-Europeans (Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	3).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Among Europeans from DIAGRAM+ study, direction of effect was same as found in Indo-Europeans, but the association could not reach statistical significance
1	NA	MAP3K1	NA	DISCUSS	MAP3K1 was identified as a promising candidate for T2D, which has not been reported earlier, but needs further investigation.
1	NA	MAP3K1	C for 48	DISCUSS	MAP3K1 codes for serine/threonine protein kinase and has been shown to have an essential role in stress-induced beta-cell death and inhibits transcription of insulin.
1	NA	MAP3K1	rs10461617	DISCUSS	We observed suggestive association at rs10461617 in the 5' flank of MAP3K1.
1	NA	NA	rs10461617	DISCUSS	The rs10461617 was also observed to have nominal association with T2D in Dravidians and DIAGRAM+ with consistency in direction of effect.
1	NA	MAP3K1	NA	DISCUSS	Although the association of MAP3K1 variant could not reach genome-wide significance, these results and biological roles of MAP3K1 suggest it as an important candidate for T2D
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Most of the previously reported T2D-associated loci from earlier GWAS showed consistency in direction of association with similar effect sizes in Indo-European subjects of the present study, of which 25 were also associated at P < 0.05.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Association at other known loci could not be detected mainly due to the low power of the current study to detect those associations, as most of these loci were identified through meta-analysis of GWAS, including large study populations.
0	NA	PTPRD	NA	DISCUSS	Only at loci PTPRD, HNF1B, THADA, and SRR, we did not observe association even when our study was sufficiently powered (>98%) to detect the previously reported effect sizes.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The effect sizes at these loci in our study population could be very small; thus, a larger study population would be required to confirm their association status in our population.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We also found consistent results as in the recent GWAS in South Asians.
0	NA	HNF4A	NA	DISCUSS	Of the six loci identified in the recent GWAS in South Asians, HNF4A has been shown to be associated in our previous study involving study subjects from the current study and was also associated in the current study (P = 0.004).
0	NA	HMG20A	NA	DISCUSS	The loci HMG20A was also associated in the current study (P = 0.02) while the other four loci (GRB14, ST6GAL1, VPS26A, and AP3S2) showed consistency in direction and effect size.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	All of the previously associated loci in Indo-Europeans accounted for 7.17% of the variance in the risk of T2D in our study population, which is similar to the observations in previous studies (5 to 10%).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The newly identified 2q21 locus alone contributed 0.48% of the variance, and addition of 2q21 locus to the list increased the total variance explained to 7.65%.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Thus, our analysis provides further evidence for the belief that underlying disease mechanisms involving common variants are largely similar among populations
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In conclusion, we identified a new locus associated with T2D on the 2q21 region.
0	NA	TMEM163	NA	DISCUSS	The identified region 2q21 harbors the genes TMEM163, RAB3GAP1, and ACMSDI, and incidentally, all three are involved in neurologic processes, suggesting a neurologic component in the etiology of T2D.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The findings provide new insights into the genetic architecture and pathophysiology of T2D; however, further studies exploring the functional and clinical significance of the identified locus are warranted
