0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified ~100 genetic loci associated with prostate cancer risk.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Less than a dozen of these loci were initially identified from GWAS in two Asian populations, likely because of smaller sample sizes of these individual GWAS in Asians.
