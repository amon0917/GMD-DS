0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We developed a heuristic scoring system based on breast-specific genomic data (integrated expression quantitative trait and in silico prediction of GWAS targets - INQUISIT) to rank the target genes at each locus (Supplementary Table 17).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Target genes were predicted by combining risk SNP data with multiple sources of genomic information, including chromatin interactions (ChIA-PET and Hi-C), computational enhancer-promoter correlations (PreSTIGE, IM-PET, FANTOM5 and Super-enhancers), breast tissue-specific eQTL results, TF binding (ENCODE ChIP-seq), gene expression (ENCODE RNA-seq) and topologically-associated domain (TAD) boundaries (Online Methods and Supplementary Tables 18-20).

0	aggressive disease	NA	NA	INTRO	In contrast, psychiatric diseases showed enrichment specific to central-nervous-system cell types and autoimmune disorders showed enrichment for immune cells
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We selected for further evaluation four loci to represent those predicted to act through proximal regulation (1p36 and 11p15) and distal regulation (1p34 and 7q22), because they had a relatively small number of CRVs.
1	NA	KLHDC7A	rs2992756	INTRO	The only CRV at 1p36, rs2992756 (P=1.6x10-15), is located 84bp from the transcription start site of KLHDC7A.
0	NA	PIDD1	NA	INTRO	Of the 19 CRVs at 11p15 (smallest P=1.4x10-12), five were located in the proximal promoter of PIDD1, implicated in DNA-damage-induced apoptosis and tumorigenesis.
1	NA	KLHDC7A	NA	INTRO	INQUIST predicted KLHDC7A and PIDD1 to be target genes and they received the highest score for likelihood of promoter regulation (Supplementary Table 19).
1	NA	KLHDC7A	rs2992756	INTRO	Using reporter assays, we showed that the KLHDC7A promoter construct containing the risk T-allele of rs2992756 has significantly lower activity than the reference construct, while the PIDD1 promoter construct containing the risk haplotype significantly increased PIDD1 promoter activity (Extended Data Fig.

0	NA	CITED4	rs4233486	INTRO	Subsequent reporter assays showed that the PRE1 reference construct reduced CITED4 promoter activity, whereas the risk T-allele of SNP rs4233486 located in PRE1 negates this effect
1	NA	CDP	NA	INTRO	Finally, the 7q22 risk locus contained six CRVs (smallest P=5.1x10-12) which lie in several PREs spanning ~40kb of CUX1 intron 1.

0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	These results identify two mechanisms by which CRVs may impact target gene expression: through transactivation of a specific promoter and by affecting chromatin looping between regulatory elements and their target genes.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	These data provide in vitro evidence of target identification and regulation, however further studies that include genome editing, oncogenic assays and/or animal models will be required to fully elucidate disease-related gene function
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	We estimate that the newly identified susceptibility loci explain ~4% of the two-fold familial relative risk (FRR) of breast cancer and that in total, common susceptibility variants identified through GWAS explain 18% of the FRR.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Further, we estimate that variants imputable from the OncoArray, under a log-additive model (see Online Methods), explain ~41% of the FRR, and thus, the identified susceptibility SNPs account for ~44% (18%/41%) of the FRR that can be explained by all imputable SNPs.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	The identified SNPs will be incorporated into risk prediction models, which can be used to improve the identification of women at high and low risk of breast cancer: for example, using a polygenic risk score based on the variants identified to date, women in the highest 1% of the distribution have a 3.5-fold greater breast cancer risk than the population average.
