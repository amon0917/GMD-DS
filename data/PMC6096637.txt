1	diabetes	ITGA1	rs870992	ABSTRACT	Using a recessive genetic model, we identified two novel loci associated with type 2 diabetes in Greenlanders, namely rs870992 in ITGA1 on chromosome 5 (OR 2.79, p = 1.8 x 10-8), and rs16993330 upstream of LARGE1 on chromosome 22 (OR 3.52, p = 1.3 x 10-7).

0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	Numerous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been performed to identify genetic factors predisposing to type 2 diabetes.
0	Type 2 diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	These studies, mainly performed in European and Asian populations, have identified around 120 genetic variants associated with risk of type 2 diabetes
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	Until now, GWAS of type 2 diabetes and glycaemic traits have almost exclusively been performed using an additive genetic model.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	This model, however, has limited statistical power to detect associations with variants displaying recessive effects, unless the effect is very large.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	Recently, a GWAS of type 2 diabetes in up to 4040 individuals with type 2 diabetes and 116,246 participants without diabetes from the UK Biobank applied a dominance deviation model to identify non-additive association signals.
0	diabetes	CDKAL1	NA	INTRO	Although no novel signals were identified, the paper reported a recessive effect on risk of type 2 diabetes at the previously identified CDKAL1 locus, which is in concordance with the findings from the original discovery.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	Importantly, given the effective sample size of around 15,300, this study lacked statistical power to exclude the possibility that additional alleles with recessive effects predispose to type 2 diabetes in European populations
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	We previously demonstrated the existence of a high-impact type 2 diabetes risk allele with predominately recessive effect in the Greenlandic population, despite using an additive genetic model in the discovery analysis.
0	NA	TBC1D4	NA	INTRO	Notably, however, this TBC1D4 loss-of-function variant was discovered via analyses of a type 2 diabetes-related trait, 2 h plasma glucose, on which it had an extremely large effect, and not via analyses of type 2 diabetes.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	Indeed, the study in which that variant was discovered had very limited statistical power to detect variants with recessive effects on type 2 diabetes unless they were very frequent and had very large effects.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	Here, we aimed to identify additional variants with recessive effects on risk of type 2 diabetes in the Greenlandic population by applying a recessive genetic model to an increased number of Greenlandic samples with type 2 diabetes information

0	diabetes	NA	NA	METHODS	To assess the statistical power of an additive and a recessive model-based test to detect association to a variant with recessive effect, we performed a range of simulations of data from a locus with a type 2 diabetes effect allele.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	METHODS	For each of 540 combinations of effect allele frequencies (EAFs; EAF values 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25 and 0.3) and effect sizes (ORs ranging from 1.1 to 10 with a step size of 0.1), we simulated first genotypes for n individuals and then their diabetes status based on these genotypes.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	METHODS	For the simulation of type 2 diabetes status, we assumed a baseline risk of type 2 diabetes of 0.1, which we used to randomly simulate diabetes status for all individuals who were not homozygous carriers of the effect allele.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	METHODS	For homozygous carriers of the effect allele, we simulated the diabetes status while taking both the baseline risk and the effect size into account.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	For each combination of EAF and OR, we performed 20,000 simulations, and finally, to estimate the power for the additive and the recessive model-based tests, we tested for association using logistic regression assuming each of these models, and estimated power as the proportion of tests that gave a p value <4.3 x 10-7 (the Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold of this study; see below for details).
0	diabetes	NA	NA	METHODS	We performed the power simulations for 2948 individuals to reflect the number of individuals with type 2 diabetes information available in this study
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	For analyses of association in the Greenlanders, we used a linear mixed model, implemented in GEMMA software v0.96 (http://www.xzlab.org/).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	This model controls for admixture and relatedness between individuals as random effects via a genetic similarity matrix, which we estimated using GEMMA.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	This control is needed because the Greenlandic population is admixed with ancestry from both Inuit and Europeans.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	With this model, we achieved an acceptable genomic inflation factor (lambda = 1.009; ESM Fig.

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	In all the association analyses, we analysed data combined from the three cohorts and included sex, age and cohort as covariates.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Prior to performing the association tests, quantitative traits were quantile-transformed to a standard normal distribution within each sex and each cohort.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Therefore, for quantitative traits, effect sizes are reported as beta in SD units (95% CI) in the text, and additionally as trait units in tables, obtained from association analyses on raw trait values.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	METHODS	Effect sizes for association with type 2 diabetes are reported as ORs in the text, and were obtained from logistic regression analyses adjusted for age, sex and ten principal components.

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Here, however, the genetic similarity matrix required for the association analysis was not estimated using GEMMA, as we did in our analyses of the Greenlanders, but was instead calculated using the genotype data from the linkage panel merged with the additional genotypes of the SNPs genotyped for this study
0	diabetes	NA	NA	METHODS	In the Danish data, association analyses of type 2 diabetes were carried out by logistic regression adjusting for age, sex and the first ten principal components.

0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Next, to elucidate the diabetes-related mechanisms underlying the association of the novel variants, we analysed diabetes-related traits in individuals without diabetes from the Greenlandic cohorts with a recessive genetic model.
1	NA	ITGA1	rs870992	RESULTS	Homozygous carriers of ITGA1 rs870992 had nominally increased HbA1c levels (beta = 0.13 SD [95% CI 0.027, 0.23], p = 0.012) (Table 2).
1	NA	LARGE1	rs16993330	RESULTS	For LARGE1 rs16993330, the underlying physiological mechanism seems to be linked to increased fat accumulation, indicated by higher levels of visceral adipose tissue (0.29 SD [95% CI 0.076, 0.50], p = 0.0078), larger hip circumference (0.22 SD [95% CI 0.048, 0.40], p = 0.013) and waist circumference (0.21 SD [95% CI 0.041, 0.38], p = 0.015) and higher BMI (0.18 SD [95% CI 0.0046, 0.35], p = 0.045) (Table 2).
1	NA	LARGE1	rs16993330	RESULTS	Furthermore, homozygous LARGE1 rs16993330 carriers had increased insulin resistance, indicated by higher levels of fasting serum insulin (0.22 SD [95% CI 0.027, 0.41], p = 0.026) and HOMA-IR (0.24 SD [95% CI 0.048, 0.44], p = 0.014), and lower levels of the ISI (-0.21 SD [95% CI -0.016, -0.41], p = 0.034) (Table 2).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We then performed the analyses of the same quantitative diabetes-related traits with an additive model and obtained similar results (ESM Table 3)
1	NA	ITGA1	NA	RESULTS	We subsequently attempted to validate our findings in another Arctic indigenous population by genotyping the ITGA1 and LARGE1 variants in 1059 Alaska Native Yup'ik.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	However, none of the potential associations with diabetes-related quantitative traits were replicated in this smaller sample (ESM Table 4), and analysis of type 2 diabetes was precluded due to the low number of participants with diabetes.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	RESULTS	A second line of replication was attempted in a Danish sample of 5220 individuals with type 2 diabetes and 18,556 control participants.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	RESULTS	However, we did not observe an association with type 2 diabetes using a recessive model (ESM Table 2).
1	NA	ITGA1	rs870992	RESULTS	In addition, the results of a dominance deviance model GWAS of European UK Biobank samples showed no significant rejection of the additive model for either ITGA1 rs870992 or LARGE1 rs16993330 (p = 0.54 and p = 0.36, respectively) based on 117,775 individuals.
1	diabetes	ITGA1	rs870992	RESULTS	We also queried the two variants from the available summary data from a recent additive genetic model GWAS of type 2 diabetes and found that the ITGA1 rs870992 G allele was nominally associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes, whereas no effect was observed for LARGE1 rs16993330 (ESM Table 5).
1	NA	ITGA1	rs870992	RESULTS	Additionally, queries of results from GWAS of other traits revealed associations of the ITGA1 rs870992 G allele with increased total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels, and nominal associations of the LARGE1 rs16993330 A allele with increased total cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels (ESM Table 5).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Owing to the possible inflation of the test statistics, we also included the quantile of p values for the significant tests in ESM Table 5
1	NA	ITGA1	NA	RESULTS	Finally, we queried RNA expression data available online as part of the GTEx project (www.gtexportal.org/) under the hypothesis that the newly identified variants in ITGA1 and LARGE1 could change the expression of regional genes.
1	NA	ITGA1	rs870992	RESULTS	Here we observed that the type 2 diabetes-associated ITGA1 rs870992 G allele was associated with increased ITGA1 RNA expression in nerve, pancreas and smooth muscle tissue in up to 361 samples, albeit with modest p values (p < 0.0001).

1	diabetes	TBC1D4	NA	DISCUSS	Besides the established TBC1D4 locus, we identified a novel genome-wide significant variant for risk of type 2 diabetes in ITGA1, and a variant near LARGE1 showing a suggestive association.
1	NA	LARGE1	NA	DISCUSS	Additional analyses of diabetes-related quantitative traits indicated that the LARGE1 variant might increase the risk of type 2 diabetes through accumulation of visceral fat and increased insulin resistance, whereas these analyses provided no clues to the mechanistic link underlying the ITGA1 association.
1	NA	ITGA1	NA	DISCUSS	This study demonstrates the value of using the correct genetic model for identification of disease-associated variants, which is also supported by simulations showing that, for example, for a recessive effect allele with a frequency of 0.25 and an OR of 3 (similar to the ITGA1 variant), the power under an additive model is less than 20% whereas the power under a recessive model is around 80% (ESM Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	2).
0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Moreover, under a wide range of EAF and ORs, the recessive model has markedly higher statistical power to detect variants with recessive effects associated with type 2 diabetes
1	NA	ITGA1	NA	DISCUSS	A possible link between the ITGA1 locus and altered glucose regulation is supported by studies of type 2 diabetes-related traits.
1	NA	PELO	rs6450057	DISCUSS	Recently, rs6450057 mapping to PELO, a gene embedded in intron 1 of ITGA1, was found to be associated with fasting serum insulin levels in a transethnic GWAS meta-analysis of 70,000 individuals.
0	NA	NA	rs6450057	DISCUSS	Interestingly, this study found an opposite direction of effect in European and African-American samples, indicating that rs6450057 is not the causal variant at this locus.
1	diabetes	ITGA1	rs6867040	DISCUSS	Moreover, another ITGA1 intron variant, rs6867040, has been associated with fasting plasma glucose concentrations in 46,262 European individuals, and a recent prepublished GWAS of more than 800,000 samples showed an independent association between three variants at the ITGA1 locus and type 2 diabetes using an additive genetic model.
1	diabetes	ITGA1	NA	DISCUSS	These studies support our findings of a link between variation in ITGA1 and type 2 diabetes.
0	NA	NA	rs870992	DISCUSS	However, it is unclear whether it is the same signal, as the identified variants in the European study do not include rs870992, nor are the identified variants in high linkage disequilibrium with rs870992 in Europeans (r2 < 0.1)
1	NA	ITGA1	NA	DISCUSS	Biologically, ITGA1 is an attractive candidate gene, encoding the alpha1-integrin subunit, which heterodimerises with the beta1 subunit to form cell surface receptors that bind collagen and laminin.
0	motility and insulin secretion	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Interestingly, alpha1beta1-integrin is the primary collagen receptor used by cultured beta cells, and this interaction regulates beta cell adhesion, motility and insulin secretion.
0	glucose homeostasis	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Moreover, specific interactions between alpha1beta1-integrin and extracellular matrix have been shown to be critical for beta cell survival and function, and therefore are possibly also important for glucose homeostasis and risk of type 2 diabetes.
1	NA	ITGA1	NA	DISCUSS	Besides the possible effects on beta cell function, ITGA1 seems to be linked to liver function.
1	NA	ITGA1	NA	DISCUSS	Thus, ITGA1 variants have been associated with plasma levels of the liver enzyme gamma-glutamyl transferase, and modestly with ITGA1 protein expression levels in the liver.
1	hepatic insulin	Itga1	NA	DISCUSS	In mice, knocking out Itga1 leads to severe hepatic insulin resistance and altered fatty acid metabolism when they are fed a high-fat diet.
1	NA	ITGA1	rs870992	DISCUSS	In line with this, we observed a borderline significant association between ITGA1 rs870992 and increased levels of fasting plasma glucose, which might indicate altered hepatic glucose regulation in the fasted state.
1	diabetes	ITGA1	NA	DISCUSS	Thus, studies of phenotypes reflecting liver function in Greenlanders would be of great interest to elucidate the biological mechanisms underlying the association between variation in ITGA1 and type 2 diabetes.
0	NA	NA	rs870992	DISCUSS	In eQTL analyses, no effect of the type 2 diabetes-associated rs870992 variant on mRNA expression in liver tissue was observed.
1	NA	Itga1	NA	DISCUSS	Instead, the variant was associated with increased ITGA1 expression in three other tissues; however, this was in the opposite direction to what was expected from the Itga1 knockout mice.
1	NA	ITGA1	rs870992	DISCUSS	This difference might rely on the fact that rs870992 is unlikely to be the causal variant and therefore we cannot conclude that the causal variant acts through RNA regulation even if our top SNP is significantly associated with ITGA1 expression
1	diabetes	LARGE1	NA	DISCUSS	No previous studies have indicated a link between LARGE1 and type 2 diabetes in additive model GWAS, nor did we replicate our findings in recessive analysis in a Danish sample of 5220 individuals with diabetes and 18,556 control participants.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This lack of association in European samples may rely on low statistical power for recessive effects, due to the low frequency of risk alleles (EAF<10%) in Europeans (ESM Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	2) or due to population-specific differences in linkage disequilibrium between the identified variant and the causal variant.
0	diabetes	TBC1D4	NA	DISCUSS	It is also possible that the causal variant behind the observed type 2 diabetes association is Inuit-specific, similar to the risk variant in TBC1D4.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, we were unable to pinpoint such a causal variant.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Moreover, the lack of replication of the diabetes-related quantitative traits associations in a small sample of Alaska Native Yup'ik illustrates one of the main challenges with studies of isolated populations, namely the difficulty of finding appropriate replication cohorts in terms of both genetic composition and sample size.
1	NA	LARGE1	NA	DISCUSS	It is, however, also possible that the LARGE1 association represents a false-positive discovery
1	NA	LARGE1	NA	DISCUSS	LARGE1 encodes the LARGE xylosyl- and glucuronyltransferase 1 protein.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This protein interacts with alpha-dystroglycan and functions as a glycosyltransferase stimulating glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan, which in skeletal muscles connects the cytoplasm with the extracellular matrix as part of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex.
0	NA	insulin	NA	DISCUSS	How this relates to the observed association with visceral fat accumulation and insulin resistance is unclear; therefore studies including a more comprehensive coverage of the genome and a larger sample size are warranted to verify the suggested associations, and possibly identify the causal variant in the locus
1	diabetes	TBC1D4	NA	DISCUSS	In this study, we observed three loci, TBC1D4, ITGA1 and LARGE1, harbouring variants with large recessive effects on the risk of type 2 diabetes in Greenlanders, the latter, however, having weaker statistical support.
0	Type 2 diabetes	ADCY3	NA	DISCUSS	In addition to these loci, based on a loss-of-function screening of the same population, we recently identified a variant in ADCY3 recessively associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes.
0	diabetes	TCF7L2	NA	DISCUSS	Variants in all four loci have effect sizes that are much greater than what has been reported for TCF7L2, which is the greatest genetic risk factor for type 2 diabetes among Europeans.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Even though the estimated effects are likely to be inflated by the 'winner's curse', these variants have the potential to be of clinical relevance by facilitating the prediction of diabetes development in Greenlandic population.
0	diabetes	TBC1D4	NA	DISCUSS	More research is needed to identify the causal variants, to elucidate the biological mechanisms underlying the association with type 2 diabetes, and to clarify whether these novel variants distinguish type 2 diabetes subtypes with specific aetiology, as demonstrated for TBC1D4.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This additional knowledge could have the potential to guide choice of treatment for subtypes of type 2 diabetes
0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In conclusion, we demonstrate that common alleles with recessive effects play a role in the genetic architecture of type 2 diabetes in the small and historically isolated Greenlandic population.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	These findings reiterate the importance of considering non-additive genetic models when performing GWAS
