0	Type 2 diabetes	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	To extend understanding of the genetic architecture and molecular basis of type 2 diabetes (T2D), we conducted a meta-analysis of genetic variants on the Metabochip involving 34,840 cases and 114,981 controls, overwhelmingly of European descent.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	We identified ten previously unreported T2D susceptibility loci, including two demonstrating sex-differentiated association.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Genome-wide analyses of these data are consistent with a long tail of further common variant loci explaining much of the variation in susceptibility to T2D.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Exploration of the enlarged set of susceptibility loci implicates several processes, including CREBBP-related transcription, adipocytokine signalling and cell cycle regulation, in diabetes pathogenesis
0	Type 2 diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic metabolic disease with multifactorial pathogenesis.
0	familial aggregation of the disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Although the genetic contribution to T2D is well recognized, the current set of 56 established susceptibility loci, identified primarily through large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS), captures at best 10% of familial aggregation of the disease.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	"The characteristics (effect sizes and risk allele frequencies (RAF)) of the variants contributing to the ""unexplained"" genetic variance remain far from clear."
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	At the same time, difficulties in inferring biological mechanisms from the variants of modest effect identified by GWAS have inhibited progress in defining the pathophysiological basis of disease susceptibility.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	One key question is whether characterization of increasing numbers of risk loci will provide evidence, at the functional level, that susceptibility involves a limited set of molecular processes
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	To extend the discovery and characterization of variants influencing T2D susceptibility, we performed large-scale genotyping using the Metabochip.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	This custom array of 196,725 variants was designed to facilitate cost-effective follow-up of nominal associations for T2D and other metabolic and cardiovascular traits, and to enhance fine-mapping of established loci.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	"The T2D-nominated component of Metabochip comprises 21,774 variants, including 5,057 ""replication"" SNPs that capture the strongest, independent (CEU r2 < 0.2) autosomal association signals from the GWAS meta-analysis conducted by the DIAbetes Genetics Replication and Meta-analysis (DIAGRAM) Consortium."
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	"This genome-wide meta-analysis (""DIAGRAMv3"") includes data from 12,171 cases and 56,862 controls of European descent imputed up to 2.5 million autosomal SNPs, and augments the previously published ""DIAGRAMv2"" meta-analysis with four additional GWAS (Supplementary Table 1)."
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The T2D-nominated content of Metabochip includes a further 16,717 variants, most chosen from 1000 Genomes Project pilot data, to fine-map 27 established susceptibility loci
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	"Our primary investigation combined the DIAGRAMv3 (""Stage 1"") GWAS meta-analysis with a ""Stage 2"" meta-analysis comprising 22,669 cases and 58,119 controls genotyped with Metabochip, including 1,178 cases and 2,472 controls of Pakistani descent (PROMIS) (Online Methods and Supplementary Table 1)."
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	There was little evidence of heterogeneity in allelic effects between European- and Pakistani-descent studies in Stage 2 (Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	1), so we report the combined meta-analysis including PROMIS with genomic control correction
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Combining Stage 1 and Stage 2 meta-analyses (Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	2), we identified eight new T2D susceptibility loci at genome-wide significance (P < 5 x 10-8) (Table 1, Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	3 and Supplementary Table 2).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	By convention, we have labelled loci according to the gene nearest to the lead SNP, unless a compelling biological candidate maps nearby.
1	NA	ZMIZ1	NA	RESULTS	The strongest signals mapped to ZMIZ1 (P = 1.0 x 10-10), ANK1 (P = 2.5 x 10-10), and the region flanking KLHDC5 (P = 6.1 x 10-10).
1	NA	HMG20A	NA	RESULTS	We also observed genome-wide significant association at HMG20A (P = 4.6 x 10-9) and GRB14 (P = 1.0 x 10-8), both implicated in a recent meta-analysis of T2D in South Asians.
1	NA	HMG20A	NA	RESULTS	Neither has previously been reported in European studies, and both remain genome-wide significant after removing PROMIS from the meta-analysis (HMG20A P = 1.9 x 10-9; GRB14 P = 5.8 x 10-9).
1	NA	HMG20A	NA	RESULTS	The lead SNPs from both meta-analyses are in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) (HMG20A r2 = 0.89 and GRB14 r2 = 0.77 in CEU), and likely represent the same association signals.
1	NA	MC4R	NA	RESULTS	At the previously unreported loci, we observed nominal evidence of association (P < 0.05) in the South Asian and recent East Asian meta-analyses for the lead SNPs at MC4R and ZMIZ1 (Supplementary Table 3), with consistent directions of effect across all three ancestry groups
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Several of these signals map to loci previously implicated in T2D-related metabolic traits (Supplementary Table 4).
1	NA	MC4R	NA	RESULTS	The lead SNP at MC4R is in strong LD with variants associated with BMI (CEU r2 = 0.80) and triglycerides (CEU r2 = 0.84) and is associated with waist circumference and insulin resistance.
1	NA	MC4R	NA	RESULTS	As with FTO, the T2D-effect at MC4R is probably secondary to the BMI association.
1	NA	GRB14	NA	RESULTS	The lead SNP at GRB14 is highly correlated with variants associated with waist-hip ratio (WHR) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (CEU r2 = 0.93).
1	NA	CILP2	NA	RESULTS	At CILP2, the lead SNP for T2D is also associated with triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and total cholesterol.
1	NA	ANK1	NA	RESULTS	In contrast, the previously-reported association signals for haemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) levels near ANK1 are both independent (CEU r2 < 0.01) of the lead T2D SNP from our meta-analysis.
1	anaemia	ANK1	NA	RESULTS	Given the role played by rare ANK1 mutations in hereditary anemias, the HbA1C associations at this locus were assumed to be driven by abnormal erythrocyte development and/or function.
0	glucose homeostasis	NA	NA	RESULTS	However, our newly discovered independent association with T2D (in cohorts where HbA1C was not used for diagnosis) suggests that variation at this locus also has direct effects on glucose homeostasis
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The associated lead variants at the eight newly identified loci were common (Stage 2 RAF 0.08-0.89) and had modest effects on T2D susceptibility (allelic odds ratios (OR) 1.07-1.14).
0	NA	DUSP9	NA	RESULTS	Under a multiplicative model within and between variants, the sibling relative risk attributable to lead SNPs rose from lambdaS = 1.093 at the 55 previously described autosomal T2D loci represented on Metabochip (DUSP9 on chromosome X is not captured) to lambdaS = 1.104 after inclusion of the eight newly discovered loci (Supplementary Table 5).
0	multifactorial disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	Assuming a T2D population prevalence of 8%, these 63 newly discovered and established autosomal loci together account for 5.7% of variance in disease susceptibility, as calculated by transforming dichotomous disease risk onto a continuous liability scale (Online Methods)
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	To determine the extent to which additional common variant associations contribute to the overall variance explained, we compared directional consistency in allelic effects between the two stages of the meta-analysis.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Figure 1 presents the distribution of Z-scores from Stage 2, aligned to the risk allele from Stage 1, at a subset of 3,412 independent (CEU r2 < 0.05) T2D replication variants that excludes lead SNPs and possible proxies (CEU r2 >= 0.1) at the 63 newly discovered and established loci represented on Metabochip.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The blue curve represents the expected distribution of Stage 2 Z-scores under the null hypothesis of no association.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	There is a clear shift in the observed distribution, corresponding to closer agreement in the direction of allelic effect than expected by chance: 2,172 (69.1%) of the 3,412 SNPs are concordant (binomial test P = 2.0 x 10-104).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	For comparison, we examined T2D association patterns in 2,707 independent replication SNPs for QT-interval, the trait showing weakest correlation with T2D susceptibility among those contributing to Metabochip and found far less directional consistency (54.4%, binomial test P = 3.3 x 10-6).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	This modest enrichment most likely reflects weak overlap of risk alleles between the two traits, since exclusion of SNPs mapping within 300 kb of directionally consistent T2D replication variants reduced this excess (52.5%, binomial test P = 0.060)
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	"The observed distribution of Z-scores can be considered a mixture of: (i) the ""null distribution"" of SNPs having no effect on T2D; and (ii) the ""alternative distribution"" of T2D-associated SNPs (Online Methods)."
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We estimated the features of this alternative distribution (red curve) and noted that addition of this class of SNPs significantly improved the fit to the observed Z-scores over the null model.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Using simulations, based on parameter estimates from this mixture model, we estimated that 488 (95% confidence interval (CI) 456-521) of the independent replication SNPs, in addition to the 63 newly discovered and established loci, are associated with T2D susceptibility.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	For comparison, we undertook false-discovery rate (FDR) analysis of the 64,646 SNPs on the Metabochip selected for replication of any trait, using P-values from the combined meta-analysis (Online Methods).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We observed broad agreement between combined meta-analysis P-values, FDR Q-values and the posterior probability of alternative distribution membership from the mixture model (Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	4)
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We were concerned that these additional, weaker association signals might reflect subtle stratification effects not eliminated by genomic control correction.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	However, using diverse European populations from the 1000 Genomes Project (Online Methods), we found no evidence that directionally-consistent T2D replication SNPs differed from other Metabochip replication SNPs with respect to FST (P = 0.88)
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	As expected, the estimated allelic ORs of the 488 SNPs are modest (1.01-1.11 in Stage 2), and larger samples would be required to establish association at genome-wide significance.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	"For example, by simulating an additional 100,000 T2D cases and 100,000 controls as a ""third stage"" to the combined meta-analysis, we calculate that only ~37% of the 488 replication SNPs in the alternative distribution would achieve this threshold."
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We estimate that these variants jointly account for lambdaS = 1.088 (95% CI 1.083-1.094), increasing the overall liability-scale variance explained to 10.7% (10.4-11.0%)
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	These estimates likely set a lower bound to the overall liability-scale variance attributable to common SNPs.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The mixture model does not take account loci not represented by Metabochip T2D replication SNPs due to failures in array design or manufacture or because the association signal in DIAGRAMv3 was too weak to merit inclusion.
1	NA	ANKRD55	NA	RESULTS	Indeed, the latter applied to two of the genome-wide significant loci, ANKRD55 and GRB14, which were nominated for inclusion on Metabochip because of associations with WHR (ANKRD55 and GRB14), blood pressure (ANKRD55) and plasma lipid concentrations (GRB14), rather than T2D
0	NA	DGI	NA	RESULTS	To estimate the contribution to the variance explained by common variants genome-wide, we undertook polygenic mixed linear modelling analyses using GCTA in two DIAGRAMv3 GWAS data sets: DGI (1,022 cases, 1,075 controls) and WTCCC (1,924 cases, 2,938 controls).
0	NA	DGI	NA	RESULTS	The estimated liability-scale variance explained by the full set of GWAS SNPs was consistent between the two studies: 62.6% for DGI (95% CI 38.1-87.1%) and 63.9% for WTCCC (95% CI 52.1-75.8%).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	These results are similar to those obtained from a complementary method integrating polygenic risk score analysis and approximate Bayesian computation applied to the DIAGRAMv2 meta-analysis, which estimated that ~49% of liability-scale variance was explained by common variants genome-wide.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	These data indicate that a substantial proportion of the variation in T2D risk is captured by common variant association signals that, individually, lie beyond unequivocal detection in single SNP analyses
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The DIAGRAMv2 meta-analysis had provided some evidence for loci harboring multiple independent association signals.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	To understand the extent to which additional variance might be attributable to multiple variants at established and newly discovered loci, we extended these analyses, focusing on the detection of independent (CEU r2 < 0.05) association signals that lie outside the recombination interval containing the lead SNP (Supplementary Table 2).
1	NA	KCNQ1	rs163184	RESULTS	We detected two loci at which multiple independent association signals attained genome-wide significance: KCNQ1 (rs163184, P = 1.2 x 10-11; rs231361, P = 1.2 x 10-9; CEU r2 = 0.01) and CDKN2A/B (rs10811661, P = 3.7 x 10-27; rs944801, P = 2.4 x 10-9; CEU r2 = 0.01) (Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	2).
1	NA	KCNQ1	NA	RESULTS	Both signals at KCNQ1 have previously been reported in East Asian and European populations.
1	NA	CDKN2A	NA	RESULTS	However, the secondary signal at CDKN2A/B, which maps to the non-coding CDKN2B-AS1 (ANRIL) transcript, has not previously been implicated in T2D susceptibility.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	This signal is independent of the previously reported haplotype effect at the primary T2D signal at this locus, which is itself likely due to the phase relationships between two clades of partially correlated variants.
1	NA	p<10-5	rs17168486	RESULTS	We also observed putative independent associations (P < 10-5) at DGKB (rs17168486, P = 5.9 x 10-11; rs6960043, P = 3.4 x 10-7; CEU r2 = 0.01) and MC4R (rs12970134, P = 1.2 x 10-8; rs11873305, P = 3.8 x 10-7; CEU r2 = 0.02).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	These results suggest that multiple independent association signals are widespread at T2D susceptibility loci.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Imputation up to the more complete reference panels emerging from the 1000 Genomes Project and recently developed approaches that support approximate conditional analyses using meta-analysis summary level data will be important tools for documenting the full extent of such effects, especially where the variants map to the same recombination interval
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	It has been argued that common variant association signals will often reflect unobserved causal alleles of lower frequency and greater effect size.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	"The fine-mapping content of Metabochip allowed us to seek empirical evidence to support this ""synthetic association"" hypothesis."
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We estimate, using 1000 Genomes Project data applied to HapMap CEU samples, that the array captures (CEU r2 >= 0.8) 89.6% of common SNPs (minor allele frequency (MAF) >= 5%) and 60.0% of low-frequency variants (1% <= MAF < 5%) across Metabochip fine-mapping regions.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	This represents a substantial improvement over HapMap which, across the same regions, captures 76.8% and 32.4% of common and low-frequency variants, respectively
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Across 36 fine-mapping regions on Metabochip that contain T2D susceptibility loci (including 27 explicitly chosen by DIAGRAM), we compared the characteristics of previously reported lead SNPs (defined by GWAS and HapMap imputation) and those emerging from the Stage 2 Metabochip meta-analysis.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We restricted these comparisons to Stage 2 to avoid penalizing low-frequency variants not typed or well-imputed in Stage 1.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The GWAS and Metabochip lead SNPs were the same, or highly-correlated (CEU r2 > 0.8), at 20 loci (15 with CEU r2 > 0.95) (Supplementary Table 6).
1	NA	DGKB	NA	RESULTS	"The low LD between GWAS and Metabochip lead SNPs at DGKB and KCNQ1 (both CEU r2 = 0.00) arises because they ""switch"" between independent association signals at these loci (Fig."
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	2).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	For the remaining 14 loci, there was only modest LD between the previously reported GWAS and Metabochip-defined lead SNPs (CEU r2 between 0.06 and 0.77).
0	NA	PROX1	rs17712208	RESULTS	However, at only two loci did the lead SNP after Metabochip fine-mapping have substantially lower MAF and higher OR than the previously reported GWAS lead SNP: PROX1 (rs17712208, MAF = 0.03, OR = 1.20; rs340874, MAF = 0.48, OR = 1.06) and KLF14 (7-130116320, MAF = 0.02, OR = 1.10; rs972283, MAF = 0.48, OR = 1.01).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Since coverage across Metabochip fine-mapping regions is incomplete, we cannot unequivocally exclude the presence of causal low-frequency alleles at any single locus.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	However, the paucity of low-frequency candidate alleles across 36 loci suggests that most causal variants at these loci are common.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	A contribution of even rarer causal alleles (too rare to be represented on Metabochip) is also unlikely because the substantial effect sizes required to drive common variant association signals are inconsistent with the modest familial aggregation of T2D.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	This interpretation, favoring common causal alleles, is in agreement with the observed consistency of T2D risk variant associations across major ancestry groups
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We performed sex-differentiated meta-analysis (Online Methods and Supplementary Figs.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	5 and 6) to test for association of each SNP with T2D, allowing for heterogeneity in allelic effects between males (20,219 cases, 54,604 controls) and females (14,621 cases, 60,377 controls), thereby identifying two additional loci achieving genome-wide significance (Table 2 and Supplementary Table 7).
1	NA	CCND2	NA	RESULTS	The association signal mapping near CCND2 is most significant in males (male P = 1.1 x 10-9, female P = 0.036, heterogeneity P = 0.013), while that upstream of GIPR is most significant in females (female P = 2.2 x 10-7, male P = 0.0037, heterogeneity P = 0.057) (Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	7).
1	NA	GIPR	NA	RESULTS	The lead sex-differentiated SNP in GIPR is only weakly correlated with previously reported associations with BMI (CEU r2 = 0.06) and two-hour glucose levels (CEU r2 = 0.07) (Supplementary Table 4)
1	NA	KCNQ1	NA	RESULTS	The sex-differentiated analyses also revealed nominal evidence of heterogeneity (P < 0.05) at four established T2D susceptibility loci (Table 2 and Supplementary Tables 7 and 8): KCNQ1 (P = 0.0013), DGKB (P = 0.0068) and BCL11A (P = 0.012) were most significantly associated in males, and GRB14 (P = 0.0080) in females.
1	NA	GRB14	NA	RESULTS	The sex-differentiated association at GRB14 is consistent with the female-specific effect on WHR observed at this locus.
1	NA	KCNQ1	NA	RESULTS	As KCNQ1 and DGKB demonstrate multiple independent associations in the sex-combined meta-analysis, we investigated whether sex differences in allelic effects were consistent across these signals (Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	8).
1	NA	DGKB	rs17168486	RESULTS	This appeared true for DGKB (rs17168486, male P = 6.5 x 10-13, female P = 0.0052; rs6960043, male P = 7.9 x 10-7, female P = 0.015), but not KCNQ1 (rs163184, male P = 8.5 x 10-15, female P = 7.8 x 10-3; rs231361, male P = 2.9 x 10-6, female P = 2.9 x 10-6)
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	For most T2D susceptibility loci, the underlying causal variants and the genes through which they act are yet to be identified, and the pathophysiological processes mediating disease risk remain unclear.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We applied a variety of approaches to the newly discovered and established T2D susceptibility loci, and in some cases to putative loci with more modest evidence of association, to identify mechanisms involved in disease pathogenesis
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	As noted earlier, lead SNPs at several newly identified loci are in strong LD with variants associated with other T2D-related metabolic traits.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	To gain a more complete picture of patterns of trait overlap, we first assessed the effect of T2D risk alleles on glycemic traits in European-descent meta-analyses from the MAGIC Investigators (Online Methods).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Fasting glucose associations were analyzed for up to 133,010 non-diabetic individuals with GWAS and/or Metabochip data.
1	NA	MTNR1B	NA	RESULTS	In addition to the nine loci previously reported (MTNR1B, DGKB, ADCY5, PROX1, GCK, GCKR, TCF7L2, SLC30A8 and C2CD4A), four more T2D association signals were genome-wide significant for fasting glucose: CDKN2A/B (P = 5.7 x 10-18), ARAP1 (P = 1.2 x 10-10), IGF2BP2 (P = 1.8 x 10-8) and CDKAL1 (P = 2.0 x 10-8) (Supplementary Table 9).
0	NA	ZBED3	NA	RESULTS	The ZBED3 locus also attained genome-wide significance with fasting glucose after adjustment for BMI (P = 1.2 x 10-8).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	In contrast, lead T2D SNPs at 27 of the newly discovered and established loci showed no evidence of association with fasting glucose (P > 0.05), despite sample sizes ranging from 38,424 to 132,999 individuals (Supplementary Table 10 and Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	9).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Lead T2D SNPs at the remaining 24 loci were nominally associated with fasting glucose (P < 0.05), all with directionally consistent effects.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	These data extend previous reports indicating that the genetic landscape of pathological and physiological variation in glycemia is only partially overlapping, and are consistent with reciprocal analyses reported in the companion MAGIC paper
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Second, we extended our previous analysis of the physiological consequences of T2D risk alleles to include the newly identified loci.
0	NA	insulin	NA	RESULTS	We used the published MAGIC meta-analysis (up to 37,037 non-diabetic individuals) of HOMA indices of beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity as these traits were not included in the enlarged Metabochip study.
1	NA	ANK1	NA	RESULTS	The risk allele at ANK1 has features (nominally significant reduction in HOMA-B) indicating a primary effect on beta-cell function, whereas those at GRB14 and AKNRD55 are characteristic of loci acting primarily through insulin resistance (increased HOMA-IR) (Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	10 and Supplementary Table 10).
1	NA	GRB14	NA	RESULTS	The results for GRB14 are consistent with its broad impact on insulin-resistance related traits (described below), while at AKNRD55, these analyses point to MAP3K1, encoding MEK kinase, a key component of the insulin-signalling pathway, as the stand-out local candidate
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Next, we examined the effect of T2D risk alleles on anthropometric and lipid traits using data from the GIANT Consortium (up to 119,600 individuals after excluding data from T2D case series) and the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium (up to 100,184 individuals) (Online Methods and Supplementary Tables 11 and 12).
1	NA	p<10-5	NA	RESULTS	The only lead SNP to demonstrate convincing evidence of association (P < 10-5) with adiposity was at MC4R.
1	NA	MC4R	NA	RESULTS	The lead SNPs at MC4R and GRB14 show the same pattern of lipid associations (P < 10-5): reduced HDL and raised triglycerides.
1	NA	CILP2	NA	RESULTS	In contrast, the lipid associations at CILP2 and GIPR ran counter to expected epidemiological correlations: T2D risk alleles were associated with reduced triglyceride levels at both loci, and at CILP2 with reduced LDL and total cholesterol
1	insulin-treated diabetes	BCAR1	NA	RESULTS	Finally, we noticed that the lead T2D SNP at the BCAR1 locus is genome-wide significant for type 1 diabetes (T1D), although risk is conferred by the opposite alleles.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Across 37 T1D susceptibility loci (Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	11), we observed nominal evidence (P < 0.05) of association to T2D at six.
1	NA	BCAR1	NA	RESULTS	For three of these (BCAR1, GLIS3 and RAD51L1), the T1D risk allele was protective for T2D, while at the others (C6orf173, COBL and C10orf59), the effects were coincident.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	RESULTS	These data indicate that rates of diagnostic misclassification among T2D cases in our study are low, and also highlight interesting points of overlap in the processes involved in risk of, and protection from, these two major forms of diabetes
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The T2D-association signals emerging from the present meta-analysis map to regions containing many transcripts and potential functional variants.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	To identify promising regional transcripts, we examined expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) data from a variety of tissues (Online Methods and Supplementary Note).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	At six of the newly discovered loci, the lead T2D SNP showed strong cis-eQTL associations and was highly correlated (CEU r2 > 0.8) with the lead cis-eQTL SNP (Supplementary Table 13).
1	NA	GRB14	NA	RESULTS	"These ""coincident"" eQTL implicate GRB14 (omental fat), ANK1 (omental and subcutaneous fat, liver and prefrontal cortex), KLHDC5 (blood, T cells and CD4+ lymphocytes), BCAR1 (blood), ATP13A1 (at the CILP2 locus, blood and monocytes), HMG20A (liver) and LINGO1 (also at the HMG20A locus, adipose tissue)."
1	NA	GRB14	NA	RESULTS	For those loci (GRB14, ANK1 and BCAR1) for which individual-level expression data for the appropriate tissues were available, we confirmed signal coincidence by conditional analyses (Online Methods and Supplementary Table 14)
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We used 1000 Genomes Project data to search for non-synonymous variants in strong LD (CEU r2 > 0.8) with lead SNPs at the newly discovered loci (Online Methods).
1	NA	TM6SF2	rs10401969	RESULTS	The only candidate allele uncovered was a non-synonymous variant in exon 6 of TM6SF2 (19-19379549, CEU r2 = 0.98 with rs10401969) at the CILP2 locus.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	This change is predicted by SIFT to have no appreciable effect on protein function
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	To extend previous efforts to define pathways and networks involved in T2D pathogenesis, we combined meta-analysis data with protein-protein interactions (PPI), semantic relationships within the published literature and annotated pathways (Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	3).
0	diabetes	NA	NA	RESULTS	"For these analyses, we generated a ""primary"" list of 77 transcripts mapping nearest to lead SNPs at T2D susceptibility loci or implicated in monogenic diabetes (Online Methods and Supplementary Table 15)"
