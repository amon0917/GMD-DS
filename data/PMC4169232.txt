0	cancers	NA	NA	INTRO	Lung cancer in never smokers ranks as the seventh most common cause of cancer death worldwide.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	A number of observations suggest that the molecular pathogenesis of lung cancer differs by smoking status.
0	NA	ErbB	NA	INTRO	Differences have been reported by smoking status for cellular and molecular carcinogenic pathways, distinct profiles of oncogenic mutations (for example, in EGFR), and response to targeted therapy.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Compared to lung cancer in smokers, cases in never smokers are more likely to arise in women at a younger age and there is a greater proportion of cases with the adenocarcinoma histology subtype.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Epidemiological studies of lung cancer in never smokers have shown that the incidence of lung cancer in women is particularly high in Asia, which is partially attributed to exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, combustion products from indoor heating and cooking fuel, and cooking oil fumes
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	To gain insight into the etiology of lung cancer among never-smoking women, we formed the Female Lung Cancer Consortium in Asia (FLCCA), which includes studies drawn from mainland China, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, and Hong Kong.
0	lung cancer	TERT	NA	INTRO	Previously, we published the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of lung cancer in never-smoking Asian women, including 584 cases and 585 controls with large-scale replication, reporting an association at 5p15.33 near the TERT gene ; in this study, it was also notable that the estimated effect of the associated locus was greater in non-smoking Asian women than the reported effect size observed in primarily smokers of European ancestry.
1	NA	TP63	NA	INTRO	We also confirmed an association signal in TP63 at 3q28, replicating the report from a GWAS conducted in Japan
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	To identify new susceptibility loci in Asian never-smoking women, we conducted a lung cancer GWAS in 14 studies (13 case-control studies and 1 cohort study, Supplementary Note, Supplementary Table 1).
0	cancers	NA	NA	INTRO	Samples were scanned at 6 centers (Online Methods): the United States National Cancer Institute (NCI) Cancer Genomic Research (CGR) Laboratory, the Genome Institute of Singapore, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, GeneTech Biotech Co. in Taiwan, Gene-Square Biotech in Beijing, and deCODE Genetics in Iceland.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	After stringent quality control analysis of genotypes (Online Methods), we combined datasets for 5,510 lung cancer cases and 4,544 controls using a previously described clustering algorithm.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The primary analysis was performed using logistic regression for genotype trend effect (with 1 degree of freedom) adjusted for study center, age and three eigenvectors (on the basis of principal- components analysis).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	A comparison of the observed and expected p-values in the quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot showed an enrichment of observed signals with small p-values compared to the null distribution of no association, with little evidence for genomic inflation (unscaled lambda = 1.014, lambda1000 = 1.003; Supplementary Figure 1)
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The overall association results are shown in a Manhattan plot, in which we observed both new and known loci that exceeded the threshold for genome-wide significance, P < 5 x 10-8 (Fig.

1	NA	NA	rs7086803	INTRO	In our primary scan, we observed one new locus at 10q25.2, marked by rs7086803, that substantially exceeded the threshold for genome-wide significance (OR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.24-1.41, P = 5.04 x 10-17) (Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	1, Table 1).
0	NSCLC-adenocarcinoma	NA	NA	INTRO	We developed assays to genotype 13 SNPs associated at P < 5 x 10-6 in the initial scan, using analysis of all cases or the most common subtype in non-smokers, adenocarcinoma.

1	NA	NA	rs7086803	INTRO	In a combined analysis of 6,609 cases and 7,457 controls, 3 new loci achieved associations at genome-wide significance (Table 1): 10q25.2 (rs7086803, OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.21-1.35, P = 3.54 x 10-18); 6q22.2 (rs9387478, OR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.81-0.90, P = 4.14 x 10-10); and 6p21.32 (rs2395185, OR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.11-1.23, P = 9.51 x 10-9) (Table 1, Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	2, Supplementary Figure 2, Supplementary Tables 3 and 4)
0	lung cancer	NA	rs9387478	INTRO	Analysis by histological subtype of lung cancer showed that both the 6q22.2 locus (rs9387478) and 6p21.32 locus (rs2395185) were associated with adenocarcinoma only, which comprised 71% of cases (Table 2).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The estimated effects were consistent across studies (Supplementary Figure.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	2).
1	squamous disease	NA	rs7086803	INTRO	We note that rs7086803 showed a somewhat larger effect for squamous carcinoma compared to adenocarcinoma (Table 2), but, as the number of squamous carcinoma cases analyzed was small, we consider this a preliminary observation requiring independent replication
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	To explore the relationship between these three regions and lung cancer in populations of European ancestry, we analyzed data from a previously reported GWAS of 5,718 lung cancer cases and 5,739 controls, including men and women who were primarily ever smokers.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We found no evidence for association at the three newly associated loci.
0	NA	NA	rs2395185	INTRO	In a sub-analysis of 350 never-smoker cases and 1,379 never smoker controls drawn from this study, we observed some evidence of association for rs2395185 but larger studies are warranted (unpublished data, T Landi)
0	cancers	NA	NA	INTRO	We imputed SNPs catalogued in the 1000 Genomes Project March 2012 release and the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics Imputation Reference Set version 1 using the IMPUTE2 program across a 1-Mb region centered on the index SNP (see Online Methods).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The association analysis did not identify new signals that were substantially stronger than the genotyped SNPs for the two non-HLA regions (Supplementary Figure.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	3a,b).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Although there appear to be stronger signals in the imputed data for the HLA Class II region (Supplementary Figure.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	3c), HLA-typing will be necessary to unravel the specific haplotypes
0	NA	NA	rs9387478	INTRO	At the 6q22 locus, six SNPs were highly correlated with rs9387478 (r2 = 0.99 - 1.00).
0	NA	NA	rs9387478	INTRO	Two SNPs, rs9387478 and rs6937083 (pairwise r2 = 1), were observed within a region defined by the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) as containing both chromatin state segmentation and enhancer- and promoter-associated histone marks.
0	NA	DCBLD1	rs6937083	INTRO	Although the evidence for evolutionary conservation is weak (i.e., a cross-species sequence alignment comparison indicated conservation at the site of ~29.2 million years since divergence from a common ancestor), rs6937083 falls within an ENCODE predicted transcription factor binding site and an exon of the AceView predicted gene, DCBLD1.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The architecture of the region on chromosome 10q25 is more complicated because there are 23 perfectly correlated SNPs (r2 = 1) and 1 highly correlated SNP (r2 = 0.99).
1	NA	VTI1A	NA	INTRO	All localize to intron 7 or the untranslated region (UTR) of one transcript of the vesicle transport through interaction with the t-SNAREs homolog 1A (yeast) gene (VTI1A).
1	allergy	VTI1A	rs11196080	INTRO	Sixteen fall within putatively functional regions, defined as ENCODE DNase I hypersensitivity clusters, chromatin state segmentation, the UTR of VTI1A, ENCODE enhancer- and promoter-associated histone marks, and/or highly conserved (i.e., a cross-species sequence alignment comparison indicated conservation at the site of 300 million years since divergence from a common ancestor) regions (see Supplementary Table 5); rs11196080 is noteworthy because many of the functionally-predicted areas converge on this SNP, making this a high priority variant for functional follow-up studies
1	prostate carcinogenesis	VTI1A	rs7086803	INTRO	The strongest new association signal, rs7086803 at 10q25.2, maps to intron 7 of the VTI1A gene, which has been implicated in lung carcinogenesis.
1	neuro-degeneration	VTI1A	NA	INTRO	Loss of VTI1A activity has been reported to reduce high-frequency spontaneous neurotransmitter release and rapid progressive neuro-degeneration in the peripheral ganglia.
1	NA	VTI1A	NA	INTRO	VTI1A is also involved in Acrp30-containing vesicles in adipocytes, and lower amounts of VTI1A in cultured adipocytes can inhibit adiponectin secretion.
0	lung cancer	adiponectin	NA	INTRO	Lower amounts of adiponectin have previously been associated with advanced lung cancer.
1	carcinomas of the colon	NA	NA	INTRO	A recent study reported recurrent VTI1A-TCF7L2 fusions in colorectal cancers, and a colorectal carcinoma cell line with the fusion gene was shown to be dependent on VTI1A-TCF7L2 for anchorage-independent growth
0	NA	DCBLD1	rs9387478	INTRO	The rs9387478 SNP at 6q22.2 is located in an interval that contains two candidate genes: DCBLD1 (encoding discoidin, CUB and LCCL domain containing 1) and ROS1 (encoding the ROS proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase).
0	NA	ROS1	NA	INTRO	ROS1 functions as both an integral membrane protein and a receptor tyrosine kinase.
0	lung cancer	Ros1	NA	INTRO	Expression of Ros1 is specifically increased in lung cancer tissue in mice, and ROS1 expression levels are increased in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
0	lung adenocarcinomas	ROS1	NA	INTRO	ROS1 fusions in lung adenocarcinoma and NSCLC, particularly in Asian never smokers, have been identified as drivers of oncogenesis .
0	lung adenocarcinomas	ROS1	NA	INTRO	ROS1 rearrangements were found to be more common in lung adenocarcinomas from never smokers and younger affected individuals.
0	metastases	DCBLD1	NA	INTRO	There is limited evidence concerning the functional role of the protein encoded by DCBLD1; a related gene at 3q12.2, DCBLD2 (encoding discoidin, CUB and LCCL domain containing 2, also known as CLCP1), regulates cellular proliferation and invasion and may have an important role in cancer metastasis
0	NA	HLA-DRA	rs2395185	INTRO	The third locus, marked by rs2395185 at 6p21.3, is located within 20 kb of HLA-DRA (encoding major histocompatibility complex, class II, DR alpha) and 52 kb downstream of HLA-DRB5 (encoding major histocompatibility complex, class II, DR beta 5).
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	There was no evidence for strong linkage disequilibrium between this SNP and other SNPs reported for lung cancer at 6p21.32.
0	lung cancer	NA	rs3817963	INTRO	There was little LD with a recently reported SNP, rs3817963, and lung cancer in a Japanese population, also on 6p21.3; the r2 in Han Chinese and Japanese HapMap samples was 0.18 and 0.10, respectively, and D' was 0.57 and 0.43, respectively.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	These data suggest that our locus probably represents a new HLA Class II-related finding for nonsmoking lung cancer susceptibility.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Further mapping across the complex HLA region is required to characterize the specific susceptibility alleles or haplotypes involved in non-smoking lung cancer risk.
0	ulcerative colitis	NA	rs2395185	INTRO	We also note that rs2395185 has been previously associated with ulcerative colitis, Hodgkin lymphoma, and type 1 diabetes
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	In previous GWAS of lung cancer, in which a majority of cases were smokers, SNPs across a region at 15q25 have been associated with lung cancer risk.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	However, studies of smoking related behavior have also identified variants at 15q25, raising the possibility that the variants previously identified by GWAS for lung cancer could mediate risk through effects on tobacco use.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	We previously genotyped additional SNPs across 15q25 in Asian studies and observed no evidence of association with lung cancer in never-smoking Asian females.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Notably, in our current, larger study, there was no evidence for association with lung cancer at 15q25 in the never-smoking population overall or in the major subtypes.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	These data provide strong evidence that this locus is not associated with lung cancer independent of smoking in never-smoking females in Asia, which contrasts with the results from a smaller Asian study, but is consistent with previous reports from smaller studies conducted in populations of European ancestry
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We investigated the relationship between our new loci and known environmental exposures.
0	NSCLC-adenocarcinoma	NA	NA	INTRO	The association between exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) in the home and adenocarcinoma in the five studies with data available yielded an OR of 1.36 (P = 1.2 x 10-4) in an analysis of 1,770 cases and 2,675 controls, consistent with previous reports.
0	NA	NA	rs2395185	INTRO	The effect of ETS was stronger for subjects with the GG genotype at rs2395185, with OR = 1.78 (P = 1.15 x 10-5), compared to subjects with GT/TT genotypes, OR = 1.16 (P = 0.15), with Pinteraction = 0.002.
0	NSCLC-adenocarcinoma	NA	rs2395185	INTRO	The association between the T allele at rs2395185 and risk of adenocarcinoma in subjects with and without exposure to ETS yielded OR = 1.13 (P = 0.031) and OR = 1.43 (P = 5.6 x 10-4), respectively, with Pinteraction = 0.037.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	There was no evidence of interaction with the other two new loci reported here
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	In summary, we conducted a GWAS of lung cancer in never-smoking females in Asia and identified three new susceptibility loci at 10q25.2, 6q22.2, and 6p21.32.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We also confirmed associations with two previously reported regions at 5p15.33, 3q28 and a recently reported locus at 17q24.3.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	It is notable that our strongest finding at 10q25.2 has not been reported previously in lung cancer GWAS.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	This observation suggests that the etiology of lung cancer among never-smokers in Asia may have unique genetic characteristics.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	This is consistent with the distinct pattern of environmental risk factors that have been causally linked to lung cancer among never-smoking females in Asia, and the distinct molecular phenotypes of lung cancer in never-smokers.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Further work is warranted to map the new regions.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Functional work is required to identify the variants that directly account for the underlying association as well as to study how the genetic variants interact with established environmental risk including ETS, cooking fumes, and fuel use among never-smoking females in Asia

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The PHASE outcome was used as direct input for the SequenceLDhot program and LD was estimated as r2 for 70 SNPs within a ~230 kb region, and a heat map was drawn using the snp.plotter program.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Similarly, we started with the genotypes of 63 SNPs for the ROS1/DCBLD1 regional plot and the genotypes of 59 SNPs for the HLA class II locus
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	To begin to fine map newly identified regions, we imputed all the SNPs catalogued in the 1000 Genomes Project data, March 2012 release, and the DCEG Imputation Reference Set version 1.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The IMPUTE2 program was used to impute a 1 Mb region centered on the index SNP for each of the three regions, using recommended default settings.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Imputed SNPs with INFO < 0.3 were excluded from association analysis using the SNPTEST program v2.3 (see URLs), which considered probabilistic genotypes out of imputation.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Because 1000 Genomes Project data was based on the NCBI Build 37 reference genome, we conducted liftover (see URLs) on our scan data from Build 36 to 37 before imputation
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The CGEMS data portal provides access to individual level data for investigators from certified scientific institutions after approval of their submitted Data Access Request
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	FIG	Manhattan plot based on P values derived from 1-degree-of-freedom tests of genotype trend effect in an unconditional logistic regression analysis adjusted for study, age and three eigenvectors in a GWAS of lung cancer in never-smoking Asian females, including 5,510 lung cancer cases and 4,544 controls.
0	NA	NA	NA	FIG	The x axis represents chromosomal location, and the y axis shows P values on a negative logarithmic scale.
0	NA	NA	NA	FIG	The red horizontal line represents the genome-wide significance threshold of P = 5 x 10-8.
1	NA	TERT	NA	FIG	Labeled are two previously associated loci (TERT at 5p15.33 and TP63 at 3q28) together with three newly identified loci (VTI1A on chromosome 10 and ROS1-DCBLD1 and the HLA Class II region on chromosome 6)
0	NA	NA	NA	FIG	Top, association results of GWAS data (grey diamonds), TaqMan data (blue diamonds) and combined data (red diamonds) are shown in the top panel with -log10(P) values (left y axis).
0	NA	NA	NA	FIG	Overlaid are the likelihood ratio statistics (right y axis) to estimate putative recombination hotspots across the region on the basis of 3 sets of 100 randomly selected control samples representing Han Chinese, Japanese and Korean (connected lines in green, blue, and red, respectively) individuals.
0	NA	NA	NA	FIG	Bottom, LD heatmap based on pairwise r2 values from total control populations for all SNPs included in the GWAS.
1	NA	VTI1A	NA	FIG	(a) A 229.7- kb region at 10q25.2 spanning the VTI1A gene.
0	NA	ROS1	NA	FIG	(b) A 223.4- kb region at 6q22.2 spanning the ROS1, DCBLD1 and GOPC genes.
0	NA	NA	NA	FIG	(c) A 279.6- kb region at 6p21.32 spanning multiple genes in the HLA class II region.
0	NA	NA	rs2395185	FIG	Because a Taqman assay could not be designed for rs2395185, we instead genotyped rs28366298, its perfect surrogate (r2 = 1.0), by TaqMan.
0	NA	NA	rs2395185	FIG	The reported P value is based on meta-analysis of the rs2395185 results in the GWAS and the rs28366298 results in the TaqMan set.
0	NA	NA	NA	FIG	Genomic coordinates are based on NCBI Human Genome Build 36.
