0	lung cancer	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Inherited susceptibility to lung cancer risk in never smokers is poorly understood.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	The major reason for this gap in knowledge is that this disease is relatively uncommon (except in Asians), making it difficult to assemble an adequate study sample.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	In this study we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on the largest, to date, set of European-descent never smokers with lung cancer
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	We conducted a two-phase (discovery and replication) GWAS in never smokers of European descent.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	We further augmented the sample by performing a meta-analysis with never smokers from the recent OncoArray study, which resulted in a total of 3,636 cases and 6,295 controls.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	We also compare our findings with those in smokers with lung cancer
1	NA	NA	rs31490	ABSTRACT	"We detected three genome-wide statistically significant SNPs rs31490 (OR 0.769, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.722-0.820], p-value 5.31x10-16), rs380286 (OR 0.770, 95% CI [0.723-0.820], p-value 4.32x10-16), and rs4975616 (OR 0.778, 95% CI [0.730-0.829], p-value 1.04x10"" )."
1	lung cancer	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	All three mapped to Chromosome 5 CLPTM1L-TERT region, previously shown to be associated with lung cancer risk in smokers and in never smoker Asian women, and risk of other cancers including breast, ovarian, colorectal and prostate
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	We found that genetic susceptibility to lung cancer in never smokers is associated to genetic variants with pan-cancer risk effects.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	The comparison with smokers shows that top variants previously shown to be associated with lung cancer risk only confer risk in the presence of tobacco exposure, underscoring the importance of gene-environment interactions in the etiology of this disease
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide, accounting for over 1 million deaths each year .
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Although most lung cancer is preventable, since the majority of cases occur in tobacco smokers , around 10% of cases are seen in lifetime never-smokers.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Even though lung cancer is diagnosed in a minority of never smokers it still ranks as the seventh to ninth most common cause of cancer death worldwide
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	In never smokers, lung cancer has characteristics distinct from those associated with smoking, including different histology and mutation spectrum .
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	The only well-established risk factors for lung cancer in never smokers are exposure to radon , secondhand smoke and dust , asbestos , and, notably, family history of cancer ,, which has provided evidence for inherited susceptibility
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	To date, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on lung cancer has largely been focused on ever smokers, and have identified 18 independent loci influencing risk .
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	While several GWAS studies in never smokers have been conducted, these have primarily been based on Asian women .
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Several environmental risk factors for lung cancer, including cooking fumes and air pollution, are highly prevalent in Asian populations , raising the possibility of effect modification.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Identifying lung cancer susceptibility alleles among never smoking European populations has been limited to candidate gene analyses  and small GWA studies .
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Reported here are the results of a large GWAS of lung cancer in never smokers of European descent, based on 3,636 cases and 6,295 controls
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Never smokers were defined as individuals who had smoked less than 100 cigarettes over their lifetime.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	METHODS	The study had a discovery and a replication series, both from studies participating in the International Lung Cancer Consortium (ILCCO; http://ilcco.iarc.fr).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The discovery series, after quality control (Appendix), comprised 1,287 cases and 1,655 controls with European ancestry from seven centers (Table A.1).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The replication series comprised 960 cases and 940 controls from 16 study centers, of which some centers (but not study subjects) participated also in the discovery phase (Table A.2).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Comprehensive details of each series have been previously reported .
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	METHODS	To increase statistical power, data on never smokers recently generated by the OncoArray lung cancer study from ILCCO  were also leveraged.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	After excluding samples overlapping between the OncoArray and the discovery set and between the OncoArray and the replication set, 1,149 cases and 1,144 controls from the discovery, 1,527 cases and 4,211 controls from the OncoArray, and 960 cases and 940 controls from the replication sets were included in the final analyses.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	METHODS	Most of the lung cancer cases (76.7% in the discovery, 69.2% in the replication, and 63.1% in the OncoArray sets) had histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma, followed by squamous and small cell carcinoma (Tables A.1-A.3).
0	NSCLC-adenocarcinoma	NA	NA	METHODS	Given that subtype-specific associations are likely to exist, adenocarcinomas were also analyzed separately.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Table 1 presents the demographic characteristics of the final dataset
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Both cases and controls from the discovery set were genotyped using Illumina Infinium OmniExpress-24 v1.2 BeadChips, with the exception of cases and controls from Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH), genotyped on Illumina Human660W-Quad BeadChip.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Genotyping of the replication series for 384 selected SNPs was performed using Illumina GoldenGate technology.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Genotyping quality control and SNP selection procedures are detailed in the Appendix.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The OncoArray genotyping platform, the never smoker samples to which it was applied, and genotyping and quality control procedures are described in the Appendix and have been previously characterized in detail
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	To harmonize data and address population stratification in the discovery set, the studies were grouped as follows.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Provided they used the same genotyping array and study participants were from the similar geographic origin they were combined.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	This resulted in two groups: UK studies and North American studies.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Since the HSPH samples were genotyped on a different platform, these were analyzed separately.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Thus the following clusters were used: (i) HSPH, (ii) UK, and (iii) North America (see Table A.4 for more detail).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Three separate GWAS analyses were ran based on the three groups.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We applied logistic regression analyses with case-control status as the outcome and the SNP genotype as a predictor to identify risk-associated SNPs in these three groups.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Additive models, with 0 for the reference allele homozygotes, 1 for heterozygotes, and 2 for variant allele homozygotes were used.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Reference alleles were defined as in the hg19 reference genome.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Age (continuous variable), sex, secondhand smoke exposure (SHS; from any venue at any period in a lifetime), education level, and study site within the group (if more than one site) were used as covariates.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The definition of the education variables and more information on the SHS assessment are given in the Appendix.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Missing values for SHS and education status were treated as a separate category.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	To offset potential effects of population stratification within clusters, SNP based principal components analyses (PCA) were performed  and the corresponding first five principal components were included as covariates, even though the PCA of these three GWAS clusters do not suggest population stratification (Figure A.1).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	An inverse variance fixed effects meta-analysis was used to combine the results for the three group-based GWASs
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	A brief description of the OncoArray never smoker dataset is provided in the Appendix.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	To perform the joint analysis of the discovery and the OncoArray sets, inverse variance meta-analysis was used, whereby studies were grouped into five clusters (Discovery-North America,Discovery-UK, OncoArray-North America, OncoArray-UK, and OncoArray-Continental Europe), as detailed in Table A.5.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	This joint analysis was adjusted for age, sex, study site within the group, and the first five principal components, but not SHS or education level, as they were not available in the OncoArray set
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Criteria for SNP selection and the quality control procedures in the replication phase are described in the Appendix
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We focus on the joint analysis of the discovery and OncoArray sets as having the largest sample size (the results for the discovery set separately are presented in the Appendix, Figure A.2 showing the Q-Q plot that demonstrates no indication of an inflation of type I error (lambda=1.005), and Table A.6 presenting the list of the top SNPs derived from the discovery set (p<1x10-4))
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Figure 1 presents the scatter plot of the -log10p-values against the chromosome position (the so-called Manhattan plot) for the meta-analysis of the discovery and the OncoArray samples.
1	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The analysis identified 71 genome-wide statistically significant SNPs (P<5x10-8, the accepted genome-wide level of statistical significance ), all of them mapping to the 5p15.33 CLPTM1L-TERT region.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Table A.7 presents the 229 top SNPs at P<10-5.
0	NA	CDKN2A	NA	RESULTS	There is also a peak on Chromosome 9 in the CDKN2A region, but none of the SNPs in this regions attained statistical significance at the GWAS level
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The principal component analysis of the replication samples showed no differences by the case-control status for the first five principal components (Figure A.3)
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Table A.8 presents the list of nominally statistically significant (p<0.05) SNPs from the replication analysis.
1	NA	NA	rs380286	RESULTS	The most significant SNPs, rs380286 (p=3.88x10-7), rs31490 (p=4.68x10-7), and rs4975616 (p=2.50x10-6) were located in the 5p15.33 (CLPTM1L-TERT) region (Table 2).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	These three SNPs were significant after the Bonferroni correction for 370 tests resulting in the p-value of 1.35x10-4 to declare significance (the FDR approach identified the same three SNPs as statistically significant; Table A.8)
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The 370 candidate SNPs selected for the replication (see Appendix for the selection criteria) were analyzed using all three study population sets: the discovery, the replication, and the OncoArray (total 3,636 cases and 6,295 controls).
1	NA	NA	rs380286	RESULTS	The analysis identified three SNPs statistically significant at the genome wide level: rs380286 (P=1.6x10-14), rs31490 (P=5.1x10-14), and rs4975616 (P=5.8x10-14; Table 2).
1	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	These three SNPs are from the CLPTM1L-TERT region and the association with the variant alleles was consistently negative (OR < 1).
0	NA	NA	rs451360	RESULTS	These SNPs belong to a wide LD block corresponding to the LD Region 2 marked by rs451360 as described in .
1	NA	NA	rs380286	RESULTS	The very high LD between the pairs of SNPs (0.925 for rs380286 and rs31490; 0.915 for rs380286 and rs4975616; 0.955 for rs31490 and rs4975616) did not allow identifying the leading SNP among the three, as there was very little variation in a SNP when the genotypes of the other two were fixed
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The results of the joint analysis of the discovery and replication sets without the OncoArray samples are shown in the Table A.9.
1	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	In brief, the same 3 SNPs from the CLPTM1L-TERT region were identified as genome-wide statistically significant
1	NSCLC-adenocarcinoma	NA	NA	RESULTS	Analysis of only adenocarcinoma cases produced nearly identical results, with only CLPTM1L-TERT region SNPs showing statistical significance (Tables A.10, A.11)
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Table 3 summarizes the comparisons between our study results and previous published findings reported in never smokers from genome-wide and candidate gene/SNP association studies in both individuals of European descent and Asians.
1	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Our study confirmed SNPs located in 5p15.33 (CLPTM1L-TERT) region.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Notably, the direction of the association is highly concordant among the studies for the SNPs in this region.
1	NA	TP63	NA	RESULTS	The results for 3q28 (TP63) and 6q22.2 (ROS1-DCBLD1) regions are suggestive in our analysis (P-values of ~10-4 for both these regions).
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	RESULTS	The results from our study for the loci identified in the recently published largest-to-date lung cancer study that involved mostly smokers are shown in Table A.12
1	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	A comparison of the regional association plots for the CLPTM1L-TERT region and 15q25 (CHRNA3) region in never smokers and smokers was also performed (whereby the smokers' data were obtained from the lung OncoArray project) (Figure 2 a,b).
1	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We found that the risk association profile plotted as the -log10P for the SNPs in the CLPTM1L-TERT region in never smokers tightly followed that in smokers (Figure 2a).
0	NA	CHRNA3	NA	RESULTS	By contrast, the association profiles in the CHRNA3 region (implicated in nicotine dependence) are strikingly different in never and ever smokers, with very high -log10P values in smokers and a flat profile in never smokers (Figure 2b).
1	NA	TP63	NA	RESULTS	Analogous comparisons for two other regions, TP63 and CDKN2A, are presented in the Figure A.4
1	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The analyses of associations for the 3 most statistically significant SNPs from the CLPTM1L-TERT region stratified by the SHS exposure status are shown in the Appendix (Table A.13).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	There was no indication of SNP-SHS interaction effects or a SNP effect modification by the SHS exposure, as the interaction term was not significant for any of the SNPs
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This is the largest lung cancer GWAS so far conducted in never smokers of European descent.
1	lung cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, only one region (CLPTM1L-TERT) strongly associated with lung cancer risk in this patient population was found.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our results for this region corroborate findings by earlier studies of lung cancer in never smokers (Table 3), showing consistent direction of effect.
1	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The 5p15.33 CLPTM1L-TERT region SNPs have also been reported to be associated with multiple cancers including lung cancer in smokers , breast cancer , glioma , nasopharyngeal cancer  and prostate cancer .
0	NA	TERT	NA	DISCUSS	TERT encodes the catalytic subunit of the telomerase reverse transcriptase, which takes part in adding nucleotide repeats to chromosome ends .
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	While active in early development and germ cells, this gene is not expressed in most adult tissues, resulting in a shortening of telomeres with each cell division.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	When telomeres become critically short, the cell can no longer divide.
1	cancers	CLPTM1L	NA	DISCUSS	However, cancer cells can upregulate telomerase, which enables them to continue dividing  The CLPTM1L gene is reported to be overexpressed in lung and pancreatic cancer where it promotes growth and survival .
1	NA	CLPTM1L	NA	DISCUSS	Also there is a locus within the CLPTM1L gene that serves as a binding site for ZNF148, which promotes expression of TERT
0	NA	ELF1	rs4975616	DISCUSS	Functional annotation of the top identified SNPs using Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE)  found that rs4975616 coincides with the binding site for three transcription factors: ELF1, ZEB1 and BCLAF1.
1	NA	TERT	NA	DISCUSS	Both TERT and CLPTM1L are among the many target genes for ELF1 and ZEB1; CLPTM1L (but not TERT) is among the target genes for BCLAF1.
1	NA	CLPTM1L	rs31490	DISCUSS	According to Ensemble regulatory database , SNP rs31490 is located in the region that acts as a promotor for CLPTM1L in the developing lung.
1	NA	TERT	rs31490	DISCUSS	In the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx)  all three SNPs: rs31490, rs380286, and rs4975616 are reported as eQTLs for TERT in esophagus and CLPTM1L in skin tissue
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Previously, a fine-mapping study has been conducted on this locus to deeply investigate its association with lung cancer risk .
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The study included a limited number of never smokers and the novel loci identified did not show a significant effect specifically in never smokers.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, the direction of the effect was largely consistent with that in smokers, in line with what our study reports (Figure 2a)
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	For other SNPs, e.g.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	those reported by Li et al , no association in our study was detected.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, Li et al.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	's study  used additional covariates (e.g.
0	chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	COPD, lung cancer family history) to adjust for in their analyses.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This may have made a comparison of their results with our study less straightforward, because the data on these covariates were not available from the majority of the sites participating in our study.
0	NA	NA	rs10937405	DISCUSS	The SNPs rs10937405 for 3q28 and rs9387478 for 6q22.2, previously reported to be significant in Asian never smoking women (Table 3), showed at best a suggestive association (P-values of ~10-4 in both cases).
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	These two regions have been shown also to be implicated in other cancer sites.
1	lung adenocarcinomas	TP63	NA	DISCUSS	SNPs in the TP63 region have been shown to be associated with lung adenocarcinoma in the UK population , acute lymphoblastic leukemia , bladder cancer  and pancreatic cancer  SNPs in the ROS1-DCBLD1 region have been shown to be associated with colorectal cancer .
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This further suggests that SNPs/regions associated with lung cancer risk in never smokers are not specific for this type of cancer but rather have pleiotropic effects
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our analysis was designed to control for demographic variables (age and sex, as controls were slightly but statistically significantly younger (p<0.001) and had a higher proportion of men than cases (p<0.001)) as well as for known and potential risk factors, specifically, where possible, for education status and self-reported secondhand smoke exposure .
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	To account for possible population stratification, the first five principal components and the study site were also adjusted.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, the information on radon exposure, asbestos, prior respiratory conditions, and diet was not available from most studies.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	As such, these established and putative risk factors were not accounted for in the analyses.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	A further limitation is the self-reported nature of the never smoker status.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Differential misreporting of the smoking status, e.g., if a modest proportion of former or current smoker controls reported that they have never smoked, might lead to SNPs associated with smoking appear as protective.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Unfortunately, the great majority of the participating studies did not verify it by cotinine measurements.
0	NA	CHRNA3	NA	DISCUSS	However, SNPs in CHRNA3-5 or CYP2A6 regions, known to be associated with smoking , did not show any effect in this study (Figure 2b; Table A.11)
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Latest GWASs of lung cancer in smokers have generated many more findings than did this study, which is not surprising given that the former are much larger.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Most SNPs reported as statistically significant in smokers showed the same direction of effect in never smokers (Table A.12).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Gene-smoking interaction may be another factor contributing to the higher number of positive findings among smokers than never smokers: some of the sequence variations that are neutral in the absence of tobacco smoking confer risk when smoking and the associated tissue and DNA damage are present
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	High BMI  and alcohol exposure  are common and may also explain a proportion of the lung cancer risk in never smokers.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	It is possible that there are rare variants influencing risk that could not be detected by a GWAS that focuses on common variants.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Additionally, gene-gene interactions that are beyond the scope of this study may in part explain variability in the incidence of lung cancer in never smokers.
0	lung cancer	p53	NA	DISCUSS	Very rarely, individuals can carry inherited mutations in TP53 increasing lung cancer risk .
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The availability of results from our GWAS will allow additional exposures to be studied using Mendelian Randomization approaches (as exemplified in ), and developing models that can identify never smokers at highest risk for lung cancer development could improve early detection
