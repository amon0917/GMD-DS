0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The 20q13.33 locus also contains two variants independently associated with BPH/LUTS.
1	NA	GATA5	NA	RESULTS	One of these variants, rs200383755_C, is a missense variant (p.Ser19Trp) in the GATA5 gene.

0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	RESULTS	Prostate cancer and BPH/LUTS can coexist in elderly men, e.g.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	RESULTS	in the Icelandic BPH/LUTS study group 15% of the men have also been diagnosed with prostate cancer and 8.8% in the UK sample set.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	RESULTS	Two of the BPH/LUTS variants discovered in our study have previously been reported to associate with risk of prostate cancer, i.e.
1	NA	TBX5	rs2555019	RESULTS	rs2555019 (it has r2 = 0.81 with rs1270884) located downstream of TBX5 on 12q24.21, and rs11651052 (which has r2 = 0.91 with rs4430796) located intronic in HNF1B on 17q12.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	RESULTS	Therefore, we performed a GWAS of BPH/LUTS, where we excluded all men known to have prostate cancer, included in our study groups (see Supplementary Table 6).
1	NA	NA	rs11651052	RESULTS	The results from this analysis did not yield any new genome-wide significant BPH/LUTS loci but the results for rs11651052 on chromosome 17q12 fell well below our threshold of genome-wide significance.
1	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The combined unconditional association results for rs11651052_A and the total list of BPH/LUTS (i.e.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	RESULTS	including men also with prostate cancer) were: OR = 0.93 and P = 3.2 x 10-10, whereas the unconditional results for men only known to have BPH/LUTS were: OR = 0.95 and P = 7.5 x 10-6 (see Supplementary Tables 2 and 6).
1	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	rs11651052	RESULTS	It is therefore possible that our initial BPH/LUTS association signal for rs11651052 was inflated due to a confounding effect from men diagnosed with both BPH/LUTS and prostate cancer (i.e.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	RESULTS	the association effects for BPH/LUTS and prostate cancer are in the same direction, see Supplementary Table 7).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The observed difference could also be due to a chance based on who were and who were not removed from the study group for the purpose of this focused analysis.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	RESULTS	However, disentangling the BPH/LUTS effect from the prostate cancer effect is likely to be challenging and probably requires a very large sample set, preferably including several populations
0	error bars	NA	NA	RESULTS	The BPH/LUTS association results for the variant on 12q24.21 (rs2555019_T) became more significant after excluding men diagnosed with both BPH/LUTS and prostate cancer.
0	error bars	NA	NA	RESULTS	The unconditioned combined association results for rs2555019_T and the total list of BPH/LUTS (i.e.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	RESULTS	including men also with prostate cancer) were: OR = 0.93 and P = 1.4 x 10-10, whereas the unconditioned combined results for men only known to have BPH/LUTS were: OR = 0.92 and P = 3.0 x 10-12 (see Supplementary Tables 2 and 6).
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	RESULTS	This is probably because the effect estimates for BPH/LUTS and prostate cancer are in the opposite direction (see Supplementary Table 7).
1	NA	NA	rs2555019	RESULTS	However, for clarity and consistency of the data, the results reported in Table 1 for rs2555019 are based on the total list of men with BPH/LUTS (i.e.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	RESULTS	including men with prostate cancer), same as for the rest of the data in Table 1
0	NA	PSA	NA	RESULTS	Nine of the BPH/LUTS variants discovered in our study have previously been reported to be genome-wide significantly associated with serum levels of PSA (Supplementary Tables 7 and 8).
0	Breast and prostate cancer	PSA	NA	RESULTS	These results and the fact that BPH is known to increase serum PSA levels, prompted us to check the association of all 23 BPH/LUTS variants with serum levels of PSA in a sample set of 33,572 Icelandic males, not known to have been diagnosed with prostate cancer or symptomatic BPH/LUTS.
0	NA	PSA	NA	RESULTS	Our analysis showed that in total, 15 of the 23 BPH/LUTS variants reported here also associate with PSA levels at a Bonferroni corrected significance threshold (P < 0.0022; see Supplementary Table 7).
0	NA	PSA	NA	RESULTS	Moreover, the effect estimates for BPH/LUTS and PSA levels are directionally consistent for all 15 variants (see Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	3)
0	NA	PSA	NA	RESULTS	We estimated the genetic correlation between serum levels of PSA and BPH/LUTS, using cross-trait LD score regression and the summary statistics from our GWAS of PSA in Iceland and the corresponding data from the GWAS of BPH/LUTS in the UK samples.
0	NA	PSA	NA	RESULTS	Our results show a very strong genetic correlation (rg = 0.77; P = 2.6 x 10-11, see Supplementary Table 9) between PSA levels and BPH/LUTS, across these two study populations.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	PSA	NA	RESULTS	For comparison purposes, we checked the genetic correlation between serum levels of PSA and prostate cancer across the same two study populations.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	PSA	NA	RESULTS	Our results demonstrate a strong genetic correlation (rg = 0.41; P = 6.1 x 10-5) between serum levels of PSA and prostate cancer but still it is much weaker than for BPH/LUTS and PSA levels.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	RESULTS	For comparison, our results indicate that the genetic correlation (rg) between BPH/LUTS and prostate cancer is 0.17, although nonsignificant (P = 0.18, see Supplementary Table 9)
0	NA	NA	NA	TABLE	Results from testing the association between polygenic risk scores based on UK data, and a phenotype status, based on Icelandic dat
0	Breast and prostate cancer	PSA	NA	RESULTS	We also calculated polygenic risk scores (PRSs) to estimate the contribution of variants that associate with BPH/LUTS or prostate cancer, respectively, to variation in PSA levels.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	PSA	NA	RESULTS	We used effect estimates from the GWAS of BPH/LUTS and prostate cancer in the UK samples to generate PRSs to correlate with serum levels of PSA in the 18,929 Icelandic men (see Methods).
0	Breast and prostate cancer	PSA	NA	RESULTS	The PRSs for BPH/LUTS and prostate cancer correlate very significantly with PSA levels; each standard deviation (SD) increase in the PRSs corresponds to 12.9% (P = 6.0 x 10-45) and 16.3% (P = 9.8 x 10-68) increase in PSA levels, respectively (Table 2a).
0	Breast and prostate cancer	PSA	NA	RESULTS	The effects of the PRSs for BPH/LUTS and prostate cancer on PSA levels are largely independent since, in a joint analysis the effect of both remained highly significant, i.e.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	8.6% increase (P = 3.0 x 10-20) and 13.3% increase (P = 4.1 x 10-43), respectively (Table 2b).
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	RESULTS	This is consistent with the observation that the PRS for BPH/LUTHS has little predictive power for prostate cancer, and vice versa; one SD increase in the PRS for BPH/LUTS increased the risk for prostate cancer by about 4% (P = 0.059), and the same increase of the prostate cancer PRS results in about 5% increase of BPH/LUTS risk (P = 0.0027; see Supplementary Table 10).

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The total number, combined in the Icelandic and UK GWASs, of variants tested in our analysis was 42.9 million (with imputation info score > 0.80 in both study groups) in a total of 20,621 patients and 280,541 controls.
0	NA	NA	rs200383755	METHODS	All variants reported in Table 1 had imputation information score > 0.95, except rs200383755, which had an imputation information score of 0.99 and 0.88 in the Icelandic and UK datasets, respectively.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	To account for inflation in test statistics due to cryptic relatedness and stratification, we applied the method of LD score regression to estimate the inflation in the test statistics and adjusted all P-values accordingly.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The estimated correction factor for BPH/LUTS based on LD score regression was 1.14 for the Icelandic and 1.03 for the UK datasets.

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The results from the two cohorts were combined using a fixed-effect model in which the cohorts were allowed to have different population frequencies for alleles and genotypes but were assumed to have a common OR and weighted with the inverse of the variance.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Heterogeneity (Phet) was tested by comparing the null hypothesis of the effect being the same in all populations to the alternative hypothesis of each population having a different effect using a likelihood ratio test.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	I2 lies between 0 and 100% and describes the proportion of total variation in study estimates that is due to heterogeneity
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The genome-wide significance threshold for the meta-analysis of GWASs of BPH/LUTS in the current study was corrected for all 42,907,111 being tested using a class-specific Bonferroni procedure based on functional weights of classes of variants (i.e.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	P-value < ((0.05 x weight)/42,907,111).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	This yielded significance thresholds of: (i) 1.9 x 10-7 for 11,465 high-impact variants (comprised of: stop-gained, frameshift, splice acceptor or donor); (ii) 3.9 x 10-8 for 197,583 moderate-impact variants (comprised of: missense, splice-region variants and in-frame INDELs); (iii) 3.6 x 10-9 for 2,971,445 low-impact variants (comprised of: synonymous variants 3'- and 5'-UTR variants); (iv) 1.8 x 10-9 for 5,015,711 intergenic and deep intronic variants overlapping DNase hypersensitivity sites; and (v) 5.9 x 10-10 for 34,710,908 other variants (intergenic and deep intronic)
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We applied approximate conditional analyses (COJO), implemented in the GCTA software to the meta-analysis summary statistics to look for additional association signals at each of the genome-wide significant loci.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	LD between variants was estimated using a set of 8700 whole-genome-sequenced Icelandic individuals.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The analysis was restricted to variants within 1 Mb from the index variants and that were present in both the Icelandic and UKB datasets.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We tested 14 loci and about 50,000 variants in the conditional analysis and report variants with conditional P-value < 1.0 x 10-6, obtained using a logistic regression model.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The results from GCTA-COJO were verified by conditional analysis using individual genotype data in the Icelandic and UK datasets separately and results presented in Table 1 are obtained by meta-analyzing those results
0	Breast and prostate cancer	PSA	NA	METHODS	To study PSA levels among unaffected men in Iceland, we excluded subjects who had been diagnosed with prostate cancer as recorded by the ICR (between 1955 and 2016) or were known to have undergone TURP between 1983 and 2017.
0	NA	PSA	NA	METHODS	PSA levels were quantile-standardized to a standard normal distribution and corrected for age at measurement, county of birth, and time to death using a generalized additive model with a smooth component on the age and time to death.
0	NA	PSA	NA	METHODS	Most subjects had more than two PSA measurements.
0	NA	PSA	NA	METHODS	Hence, we used the mean of the adjusted and standardized PSA values for each individual

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We estimated the genetic correlation between pairs of traits using the cross-trait LD score regression method and the summary statistics from the Icelandic and UK datasets.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	In this analysis we used results for about 1.2 million variants, well imputed in both datasets, and for LD information we used pre-computed LD scores for European populations (downloaded from https://data.broadinstitute.org/alkesgroup/LDSCORE/eur_w_ld_chr.tar.bz2).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	To avoid bias due to overlapping samples, we calculated the genetic correlation between Icelandic GWAS summary statistic for one trait and the UK GWAS summary statistic for the other traits, and the vice versa, and then meta-analyzed those results
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We used PRS analyses of the GWAS results for one trait to investigate its predictive power for another trait.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The PRSs were calculated using genotypes for about 630,000 well-imputed autosomal markers.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	For PRSs generated for Icelandic individuals, we only used chip-typed individuals and we used effect estimated based on GWAS analysis in the UK dataset.
