0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	We genotyped 302 PCA patients from 11 centers, calculated risk at 24 loci for AD/DLB and performed an exploratory genome-wide association study
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	We confirm that variation in/near APOE/TOMM40 (P = 6 x 10-14) alters PCA risk, but with smaller effect than for typical AD (PCA: odds ratio [OR] = 2.03, typical AD: OR = 2.83, P = .0007).

0	Alzheimer's disease	INPP5D	NA	ABSTRACT	ORs at variants near INPP5D and NME8 did not overlap between PCA and typical AD.
1	NA	apolipoprotein E	rs76854344	ABSTRACT	Exploratory genome-wide association studies confirmed APOE and identified three novel loci: rs76854344 near CNTNAP5 (P = 8 x 10-10 OR = 1.9 [1.5-2.3]); rs72907046 near FAM46A (P = 1 x 10-9 OR = 3.2 [2.1-4.9]); and rs2525776 near SEMA3C (P = 1 x 10-8, OR = 3.3 [2.1-5.1])
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	We provide evidence for genetic risk factors specifically related to PCA.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	We identify three candidate loci that, if replicated, may provide insights into selective vulnerability and phenotypic diversity in AD
0	atrophy	NA	NA	INTRO	Posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) is a rare neurodegenerative syndrome, typically a variant of Alzheimer's disease (AD), although occasionally due to other pathologies including dementia with Lewy bodies, corticobasal degeneration, and prion disease.
0	cortical dysfunction	NA	NA	INTRO	Patients with PCA present with combinations of cognitive problems attributable to posterior cortical dysfunction and in particular difficulties with higher level visual processing including simultanagnosia, optic apraxia, optic ataxia, and visual disorientation; other features may include dyslexia, dyscalculia, dysgraphia, and limb dyspraxia.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	In contrast with typical, amnestic AD, memory is relatively spared until the disease becomes advanced.
0	NA	tau	NA	INTRO	MR brain imaging in PCA typically shows parieto-occipital lobe atrophy with relative preservation of medial temporal lobe structures; fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) shows prominent posterior cortical hypometabolism; and in a single case study using the AV1451 tau PET tracer, posterior cortical tau deposition.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	By contrast, PET imaging using amyloid-binding ligands typically shows global amyloid deposition.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Aside from the imaging and cognitive differences, patients with PCA are typically younger than those with typical amnestic late-onset AD, usually with disease onset in the sixth or seventh decade.
0	genetic diseases	NA	NA	INTRO	PCA is almost invariably a sporadic disorder, and the risk factors for developing the syndrome are unknown.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Understanding the genetic architecture of the PCA variant of AD may provide insights both into factors predisposing to young onset AD, as well as mechanisms underlying regional vulnerability in AD
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	To date, only a few, single-center studies have addressed genetic risk for PCA, and due to the rarity of the syndrome all have been relatively small, the largest being a maximum of 81 cases.
0	Alzheimer's disease	apolipoprotein E	NA	INTRO	Some, but not all, of these studies have suggested that despite their early-disease onset, patients with PCA may be less likely than expected to have an APOE epsilon4 allele, the commonest risk factor for late-onset AD.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Other studies have suggested that there may be differences in some of the more recently identified genetic risks for AD in patients with PCA.
0	Alzheimer's disease	apolipoprotein E	NA	INTRO	Recognizing the rarity of this AD variant, we formed an international consortium comprising eleven centers, using clinical diagnostic criteria to define cases of PCA, with the principal aim of determining whether APOE epsilon4 and genetic risks from recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of AD and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB, see below) are risk factors for the PCA variant of AD.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In a second, exploratory analysis, we performed a pilot GWAS analysis to identify novel putative genetic risk factors for PCA
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	METHODS	After an inaugural multidisciplinary meeting of PCA researchers, latterly formalized as the Alzheimer's Association's International Society to Advance Alzheimer's Research and Treatment (ISTAART) Professional Interest Area in Atypical AD and Associated Syndromes, an international collaborative group was established to assess genetic risk factors for PCA.

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The final autosomal analysis thus included 5.9 M markers
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	METHODS	We assessed whether the genetic risks for typical AD and PCA were different by comparing odds ratios (OR) between our study and those published in typical AD.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We employed a Wald-type test, first calculating the standard error of the difference in log (OR) from the reported CIs.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We then divided the empirical difference in log (OR) by its standard error, and thus derived a z-score and P value, relying on the approximate normality of log (OR) estimates from large samples.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	METHODS	In the main analysis of candidate SNPs, we used a Bonferroni corrected association threshold of P < .002 based on the testing of a lead SNP from 24 independent loci derived from studies of AD and DLB
0	Alzheimer's disease	apolipoprotein E	NA	METHODS	Although the typical samples sizes that are required to discover novel genome-wide significant risk factors in complex disorders are in the thousands, there are some precedents of strong genetic effects detected with small but phenotypically homogenous samples, including variants at APOE in AD, PRNP in prion disease, and complement factor H in age related macular degeneration.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We therefore performed an exploratory genome-wide association study using established methodologies that account for population structure and with imputation of SNPs not present on the genotyping arrays.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	METHODS	As PCA is a clinical syndrome that may be due to pathologies other than AD, we also assessed the odds ratios at SNPs of interest in a subset of patients with biomarker/pathological evidence for AD
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	A total of 302 samples fulfilling entry criteria to the study were available from eleven centers: University College London (n = 94); Mayo Clinic, USA (n = 77); University of California San Francisco, USA (n = 25); University of Seville, Spain (n = 25); University of Manchester, UK (n = 20); VU University, Netherlands (n = 17); University of California San Diego, USA (n = 16); INSERM, France (n = 10); University of Milan, Italy (n = 6); CHU Besancon, France (n = 6); and University of New South Wales, Australia (n = 6).

0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Results of the genetic analysis of candidate risk factors for the whole PCA cohort are shown in Table 2.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	First, we considered 24 SNPs known to be genetic risk factors in AD and/or DLB.
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	rs2075650	RESULTS	The best proxy genotyped for the APOE epsilon4 AD-risk allele, rs2075650, located on chromosome 19 in the TOMM40 gene and 13kb upstream of APOE, was identified as a strong risk factor for PCA (OR 2.03, [95% CI = 1.68-2.46], P = 6 x 10-14, PGC = 3 x 10-13; Fig.

0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	2B).
0	NA	ABCA7	rs3764650	RESULTS	rs3764650 in ABCA7 (OR = 1.39 [1.07-1.8], P = .02, PGC = .02) and rs744373 upstream of BIN1 (OR = 1.2 [1.01-1.43], P = .04, PGC = .05) reached nominal significance but did not surpass our Bonferroni corrected threshold of P < .002.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Other candidate SNPs showed no evidence of association
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	rs2075650	RESULTS	In the subset of individuals with either biomarker (CSF or amyloid PET) or pathologic evidence for underlying AD (n = 82), rs2075650 (at the APOE/TOMM40 locus, subsequently referred to as APOE) was again identified as a risk factor with a similar OR to the whole group (OR = 2.00 [1.39-2.89] P = 9 x 10-5, PGC = 1 x 10-4).
0	NA	CR1	rs3818361	RESULTS	rs3818361 (CR1) and rs3764650 (ABCA7) both showed nominally significant differences compared with controls (CR1 OR = 1.7 [1.20-2.41], P = .003, PGC = .004; ABCA7 OR = 1.83 [1.17-2.86], P = .009, PGC = .01).
0	NA	BIN1	NA	RESULTS	There was no evidence for an effect of BIN1 (OR = 1.08 [0.76-1.52], P = .65) in the biomarker cohort
0	Alzheimer's disease	apolipoprotein E	NA	RESULTS	Comparing odds ratios and the nominal risk conferred in the whole PCA cohort against the most recently published mega-meta studies of typical AD, the effect size seen at the APOE locus was significantly less strong in PCA than for typical AD (PCA: OR 2.03, typical AD: OR 2.83, P = .0007, PGC = .001, see methods).
0	Alzheimer's disease	INPP5D	rs35349669	RESULTS	Although there was no evidence for risk in PCA vs controls, the risk effects at rs35349669 in INPP5D (P = .02, PGC = .02) and rs2718058 upstream of NME8 (P = .03, PGC = .04) both were nominally different in PCA than typical AD
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	As several different array platforms were used in the study, only 210,670 SNPs were genotyped across all samples.

0	cognitive defects	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We report findings from a consortium to study genetic risk factors in PCA, a rare predominantly early-onset cognitive disorder characterized by progressive and disproportionately posterior cortical dysfunction and atrophy, and usually associated with AD-type pathology.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our primary aim was to explore the relationship between PCA and a predetermined list of candidate SNPs derived from studies of typical AD and DLB.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our main findings are the identification of genetic risk for PCA at some of the known AD-risk loci, but not at the two DLB-risk loci that were tested (Table 3).
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	DISCUSS	We demonstrate PCA-risk association with variants in or near APOE, CR1, ABCA7 and BIN1 in the whole cohort, but only those at APOE, CR1, and ABCA7 remain nominally significant in the small molecularly defined subgroup.
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	DISCUSS	We also show evidence for nonoverlapping CIs of genetic risk at APOE, INPP5D, and NME8.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Although this is by far the largest study of PCA to date, our relatively small sample size remains underpowered to detect genome-wide significant associations at risk loci with small effect sizes, such as those shown to associate in AD-risk GWAS.
1	NA	SEMA3C	NA	DISCUSS	However, our exploratory GWAS nominates the three novel loci, SEMA3C, CNTNAP5, and FAM46A, which achieved genome-wide significance, as potential genes of interest in PCA
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	DISCUSS	Although still small for genetic studies, this collection is the result of a global collaborative effort and is considerably larger than any previous studies of PCA reporting varying evidence that APOE is a risk factor.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Although the vast majority of samples in previous studies overlap with the present study, individual studies comprise <~25% of the current total.
0	Alzheimer's disease	apolipoprotein E	NA	DISCUSS	We found robust genetic association at APOE but with an odds ratio significantly smaller than those seen in typical AD.
0	Alzheimer's disease	apolipoprotein E	NA	DISCUSS	APOE is the best established and strongest risk factor for sporadic AD and has been associated not only with increased risk per se, but also with earlier disease onset, the rate of hippocampal atrophy and more memory led disease.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, the situation is more complex in early-onset AD which is associated both with a greater proportion of nonamnestic presentations, and perhaps a relatively reduced proportion of APOE epsilon4 carriers.
0	Alzheimer's disease	apolipoprotein E	NA	DISCUSS	Studies investigating APOE risk for PCA (or as it was sometimes previously defined, biparietal AD), have shown mixed results, perhaps due to differences in case definition, and the limited sample size of each study.
0	Alzheimer's disease	apolipoprotein E	NA	DISCUSS	In this study of PCA, by far the largest yet published, we confirm that APOE is a risk factor for PCA, but that it is a weaker risk factor than for typical AD
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	DISCUSS	Addressing risk factors other than APOE, the largest single previous study:which included samples also used in this analysis:found nominally significant association with SNPs in or near CLU, BIN1, and ABCA7 .
0	Alzheimer's disease	ABCA7	NA	DISCUSS	We found evidence of association in the same direction for the SNP at ABCA7 both in the whole cohort and those with biomarker evidence for AD; for BIN1 in the whole cohort alone; but could not confirm that SNPs near to CLU are risk factors.
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	DISCUSS	Aside from APOE, only variants in CR1 surpassed our statistical threshold for multiple testing in the whole cohort; these variants also showed nominal significance in the biomarker positive subgroup.
0	Alzheimer's disease	apolipoprotein E	NA	DISCUSS	Estimates of effect size were greater in PCA than those in typical AD at each associated locus aside from APOE.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Although these differences were only nominally statistically significant, the four risk loci we report are among the strongest known common genetic risk factors for typical AD (Table 3).
0	Alzheimer's disease	CR1	NA	DISCUSS	CR1 has multiple functions including the regulation of complement and phagocytosis of immune complexes and pathogens, which are increasingly though to be relevant to AD pathogenesis.
0	Alzheimer's disease	ABCA7	NA	DISCUSS	ABCA7 may play a role in AD through regulation of phagocytosis or lipid metabolism.
0	Alzheimer's disease	BIN1	NA	DISCUSS	BIN1 mechanisms in AD are unclear but may be involved in endocytosis and the recycling of endocytic vesicles
0	Alzheimer's disease	INPP5D	NA	DISCUSS	Although they did not confer significant alteration of PCA risk, we found that odds ratio confidence intervals for SNPs at or near to INPP5D and NME8 in PCA did not overlap those of typical AD and showed directionally opposite effects, INPP5D was identified as a risk factor for AD in a recent large meta-analysis and plays an important role in a number of inflammatory processes.
0	stress	NME8	NA	DISCUSS	There is little evidence for the function of NME8 in the central nervous system, although a role in modification of oxidative stress has been proposed.
0	syndromic	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Although these findings were only nominally significant and need independent replication, they do raise the possibility that syndromic variants of AD may be differentially associated with alterations in certain risk genes, perhaps through altered responses to inflammation or stress
1	NA	CNTNAP5	NA	DISCUSS	The results of our exploratory genome-wide study implicate three potential strong risk loci, near to CNTNAP5, FAM46A, and upstream of SEMA3C.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The regions of strong LD with these associations did not include directly genotyped SNPs across all platforms, and therefore false-positive associations related to differential accuracy of imputation between case and control arm of the study remain possible.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	With the caveat that these findings must therefore be considered preliminary and require follow-up replication in an independent sample and by direct genotyping, it is notable that all three genes have roles in processes potentially relevant to PCA.
1	bipolar disorder	CNTNAP5	NA	DISCUSS	Contactin-associated protein-like 5 gene (CNTNAP5) belongs to a subgroup of the neurexin family of multidomain transmembrane proteins involved in cell adhesion and intercellular communication in the central nervous system and has been implicated as a risk factor for bipolar disorder and autism spectrum disorders.
1	neurodegenerative disease	FAM46A	NA	DISCUSS	Family with sequence similarity 46, member A1 (FAM46A), originally C6orf37, is preferentially expressed within the neural retina and has been implicated in cell signaling pathways related to retinal neurodegeneration.
1	neurodegenerative disease	SEMA3C	NA	DISCUSS	Class III semaphorins including Semaphorin 3C (SEMA3C) have been examined as potential modifying factors in neurodegeneration through interactions with plexins and neuropilins.
1	NA	SEMA3C	NA	DISCUSS	SEMA3C has been identified as a chemotrophic molecule influencing attractive guidance for cortical axon development; the expression of SEMA3C and its receptors have been shown to influence the maturation of the visual system; and SEMA3C is also expressed in the hippocampus, where it has a role in influencing the afferent connections of the developing hippocampus and in particular the ingrowth of septo-hippocampal connections, the major cholinergic connections implicated in learning and memory.
1	NA	SEMA3C	NA	DISCUSS	Finally, SEMA3C expression has been shown to correlate with functional network connectivity within the brain.
0	neurodegenerative disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Although at this stage speculative, it is possible therefore that perhaps subtle differences in cortical development might influence where pathology starts and/or how it spreads through the brain if a neurodegeneration process is initiated later in life.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The fact that all three of these novel genetic risks showed nominal associations in the relatively small subset of individuals with biomarker evidence for AD and the absence of similar evidence of association in any of these genes with IGAP studies of typical AD suggest that if confirmed, these loci may be specific risks for PCA due to Alzheimer's disease
0	rare syndrome	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The main limitation of our study is the necessarily modest sample size of this very rare disorder, noting that the case numbers presented here were only achievable through the establishment of an international consortium.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We plan to continue to collect further samples to allow for replication in due course.
0	Alzheimer's disease	apolipoprotein E	NA	DISCUSS	Based on standard power calculations in case-control studies, even in the favorable situation of completely accurate imputation of the functional SNP we are only adequately powered to detect effect sizes of OR >1.5, for common candidate SNPs, and the only common genetic risk factor of this strength in typical AD is APOE.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We made comparisons with studies of patients diagnosed with typical AD; however, these patients and/or studies are different in multiple ways including the genotyping platforms used, later age at clinical onset, potential pathologic heterogeneity, and most probably differences in geographical location, all of which could confound the comparison.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Although PCA is underpinned by AD pathology in most cases, we only had evidence for underlying AD in a proportion (~1/4), and we cannot confirm that the genetic risks we have determined are specific for the AD variant of PCA rather than the syndrome of PCA or for young onset AD.
0	Alzheimer's disease	apolipoprotein E	NA	DISCUSS	However, allowing for the fact that the confidence intervals are inevitably large, it is notable that the estimates for the odds ratios for APOE, CR1, and ABCA7, and the putative genes identified in our exploratory GWAS were similar or larger in the proportion with molecular evidence for AD, suggesting that the risk we identify are likely to be for the AD variant of PCA, rather than for the syndrome per se
0	atrophy	apolipoprotein E	NA	DISCUSS	Systematic review: Reviewing the literature for publications investigating the genetics of posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), there is conflicting evidence for the role of APOE in the PCA variant of Alzheimer's disease AD), and limited evidence for the more recently identified genetic risks for AD
0	Alzheimer's disease	apolipoprotein E	NA	DISCUSS	Interpretation: Through the establishment of an international consortium to create the largest study exploring the genetics of PCA to date, we demonstrate that (1) APOE is a risk factor for PCA but confers a smaller risk than for typical AD; (2) some of the genetic risks for typical AD are also associated with PCA risk; and (3) nominate three novel risk loci for PCA
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Future directions: These data provide clear directions and testable hypotheses for future studies, including (1) the establishment of a replication cohort and (2) investigation of the identified genes as factors influencing selective vulnerability in AD
0	neurodegenerative disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	One of the major outstanding issues in neurodegenerative disease research is an explanation for the often very striking phenotypic heterogeneity underpinned by the same broad core pathology.
0	toxicity	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Possibilities for phenotype modification include demographic and environmental factors, including age at onset, or perhaps more likely complex gene and/or environment interactions and/or factors related to the misfolded proteins and their propagation, tissue or network selectivity and toxicity.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The results of this study suggest that subtle differences in established risk factors may be associated with some of this heterogeneity and provide testable suggestions for novel genes that may influence the development of the hippocampal and visual system, which may influence the development of the PCA phenotype relative to other syndromes.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	If confirmed in future studies, next generation sequencing may be useful in determining whether these findings might be underpinned by rare variants with large effect sizes.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	More broadly, genetic investigation of well-phenotyped AD variants may provide important insights into disease biology in typical AD
