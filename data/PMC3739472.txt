0	AMD	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common cause of blindness in older individuals.
0	AMD	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	To accelerate understanding of AMD biology and help design new therapies, we executed a collaborative genomewide association study, examining >17,100 advanced AMD cases and >60,000 controls of European and Asian ancestry.
0	AMD	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	We identified 19 genomic loci associated with AMD with p<5x10-8 and enriched for genes involved in regulation of complement activity, lipid metabolism, extracellular matrix remodeling and angiogenesis.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Our results include 7 loci reaching p<5x10-8 for the first time, near the genes COL8A1/FILIP1L, IER3/DDR1, SLC16A8, TGFBR1, RAD51B, ADAMTS9/MIR548A2, and B3GALTL.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	A genetic risk score combining SNPs from all loci displayed similar good ability to distinguish cases and controls in all samples examined.
0	AMD	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Our findings provide new directions for biological, genetic and therapeutic studies of AMD
0	AMD	NA	NA	INTRO	AMD is a highly heritable progressive neurodegenerative disease that leads to loss of central vision through death of photoreceptors.
0	AMD	NA	NA	INTRO	In developed countries, AMD is the leading cause of blindness in those >65 years.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Genes in the complement pathway and a region of chromosome 10  have now been implicated as the major genetic contributors to disease.
0	AMD	NA	NA	INTRO	Association has also been demonstrated with several additional loci, each providing an entry-point into AMD biology and potential therapeutic targets
0	AMD	NA	NA	INTRO	To accelerate the pace of discovery in macular degeneration genetics, 18 research groups from across the world formed the AMD Gene Consortium in early 2010, with support from the National Eye Institute (Table 1, Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Note).
0	advanced disease	NA	NA	INTRO	To extend the catalog of disease associated common variants, we first organized a meta-analysis of genomewide association scans (GWAS) - combining data for >7,600 cases with advanced disease (geographic atrophy, neovascularization, or both) and >50,000 controls.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Each study was first subject to GWAS quality control filters (customized taking into account study specific features as detailed in Supplementary Table 2) and standardized to the HapMap reference panel and statistical genotype imputation.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Results were combined through meta-analysis and thirty-two variants representing loci with promising evidence of association were genotyped in an additional >9,500 cases and >8,200 controls (Supplementary Tables 1-3; summary meta-analysis results available online).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Our overall analysis of the most promising variants thus included >17,100 cases and >60,000 controls
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Our meta-analysis evaluated evidence for association at 2,442,884 SNPs (Figure 1).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Inspection of Q-Q plots (Supplementary Figure 1) and the genomic control value (lambdaGC=1.06) suggest that unmodeled population stratification does not significantly impact our findings (Supplementary Table 4 for details).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Joint analysis of discovery and follow-up studies resulted in 19 loci reaching p<5x10-8 (Figure 1, Table 2, Supplementary Table 5).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	These 19 loci include all susceptibility loci previously reaching p<5x10-8, except the 4q12 gene cluster for which association was reported in a Japanese population.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In addition, the set includes seven loci reaching p<5x10-8 for the first time
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We evaluated heterogeneity between studies using the I2 statistic, which compares variability in effect size estimates between studies to chance expectations.
1	NA	ARMS2	NA	INTRO	We observed significant (p<.05/19) heterogeneity only for loci near ARMS2 (I2=75.7%, p<1x10-6) and near CFH (I2=85.4%, p<1x10-6).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Although these two loci were significantly associated in every sample examined, the magnitude of association varied more than expected.
0	Geographic atrophy	NA	NA	INTRO	To explore sources of heterogeneity, we carried out a series of sub-analyses: we repeated the genomewide meta-analysis adding an age-adjustment, separating neovascular (NV) and geographic atrophy (GA) cases, in men and women, and in European- and Asian-ancestry samples separately (Figure 3, Supplementary Figure 2).
1	NA	CFH	NA	INTRO	These sub-analyses of the full GWAS dataset did not uncover additional loci reaching p<5x10-8; furthermore heterogeneity near CFH and ARMS2 remained significant in all sub-analyses (I2>65%, p <.001).
1	NA	ARMS2	NA	INTRO	Consistent with previous reports, separate analysis of NV and GA cases showed ARMS2 risk alleles preferentially associated with risk of NV (ORNV=2.97, ORGA=2.50, pdifference=.0008) whereas CFH risk alleles preferentially associated with risk of GA (ORNV=2.34, ORGA=2.80, pdifference=.0006).
1	NA	CFH	NA	INTRO	We also observed large differences in effect sizes when stratifying by ethnicity, with variants near CFH exhibiting stronger evidence for association among Europeans (p=.0000001) and those near TNFRSF10A among East Asians (p=.002).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Potential explanations include differences in linkage disequilibrium between populations or differences in environmental or diagnostic factors that modify genetic effects
0	AMD	NA	NA	INTRO	Identifying the full spectrum of allelic variation that contributes to disease in each locus will require sequencing of AMD cases and controls.
0	AMD	NA	NA	INTRO	To conduct an initial evaluation of the evidence for multiple AMD risk alleles in the nineteen loci described here, we repeated genomewide association analyses conditioning on the risk alleles listed in Table 2.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We then examined each of the 19 implicated loci for variants with independent association (at p<.0002, corresponding for an estimate of ~250 independent variants per locus).
1	NA	CFH	NA	INTRO	This analysis resulted in the identification of the previously well documented independently associated variants near CFH and C2/CFB and of additional independent signals near C3, CETP, LIPC, FRK/COL10A1, IER3/DDR1, RAD51B (Supplementary Table 6).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In four of these loci, the independently associated variants mapped very close (within <60kb) to the original signal.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	This shows each locus can harbor multiple susceptibility alleles, encouraging searches for rare variants that elucidate gene function in these regions
0	AMD	NA	NA	INTRO	To prioritize our search for likely causal variants, we examined each locus in detail (see LocusZoom plots in Supplementary Figure 3) and investigated whether AMD risk alleles were associated with changes in protein sequence, copy number variation or insertion deletion polymorphisms.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	One quarter of associated variants altered protein sequence, either directly (N=2) or through linkage disequilibrium (r2>.6; N=3) with a nearby non-synonymous variant (Supplementary Table 7).
1	NA	ARMS2	NA	INTRO	Some coding variants point to well-studied genes (ARMS2, C3 and APOE) while others help prioritize nearby genes for further study.
1	NA	CCDC109B	rs4698775	INTRO	In chromosome 4q25, index SNP rs4698775 is in strong linkage disequilibrium (r2=.88) with a potentially protein damaging variant in CCDC109B, a coiled coil domain containing protein that may be involved in the regulation of gene expression.
1	NA	COL10A1	rs3812111	INTRO	In chromosome 6q22, index SNP rs3812111 is a perfect proxy for a coding variant in COL10A1, a collagen protein that could be important in maintaining the structure and function of the extra-cellular matrix.
1	NA	CFH	rs1061170	INTRO	Interestingly, rs1061170 (NP_000177.2[CFH]:p.His402Tyr) was not in disequilibrium with rs10737680, the most strongly associated SNP in the CFH region but, instead, was tagged by a secondary and weaker association signal (Supplementary Tables 6&7).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	This is consistent with prior haplotype analyses of the locus
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We used publicly available data to check whether any of our index SNPs might be proxies for copy number variants or insertion-deletion polymorphisms (indels), which are hard to directly interrogate with genotyping arrays.
1	NA	ARMS2	rs10490924	INTRO	This analysis identified a single strong association (r2=.99), between rs10490924, a coding variant in the ARMS2 gene which is the peak of association in 10q26, and a 3' UTR indel polymorphism associated with ARMS2 mRNA instability.
1	NA	HTRA1	rs10490924	INTRO	Since index SNP rs10490924 is also in strong disequilibrium (r2=.90) with a nearby SNP, rs11200638, that regulates HTRA1, our data does not directly answer whether HTRA1 or ARMS2 is the causal gene in this locus.
1	NA	CFHR1	rs10737680	INTRO	Although a common deletion of the CFHR1 and CFHR3 genes has been proposed, there was only modest signal in this study which is likely due to linkage disequilibrium with our most significantly associated variants in the locus (r2=.31 between rs10737680 and 1000 Genomes Project MERGED_DEL_2_6731) as previously suggested
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Using RNA-sequencing, we examined mRNA levels of 85 genes within 100 kb of our index SNPs in post-mortem human retina (Supplementary Table 8).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Of 19 independent risk loci, three had no genes with expressed transcripts in either old or young retina.
1	NA	CFH	NA	INTRO	Two genes showed differential expression between post-mortem retina of young (ages 17-35) and elderly (ages 75 and 77) individuals: CFH (p=.009) and VEGFA (p=.003), both with increased expression in older individuals.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Using previously published data, we also examined the expression of associated genes in fetal and adult retinal pigment epithelium (RPE).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	This revealed increased C3 expression in adult RPE compared to fetal RPE (p=.0008).
1	AMD	CFH	NA	INTRO	CFH, VEGFA and C3 are thus up-regulated with aging, and their role in AMD may indicate an accelerated aging process.
1	NA	CFH	NA	INTRO	In addition to C3 and CFH, all the complement genes with detectable expression in the retina or RPE experiments showed higher expression levels in older tissue
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	To identify biological relationships among our genetic association signals, we catalogued the genes within 100kb of the variants in each association peak (r2>0.8 with the index SNP listed in Table 1).
0	atherosclerotic	NA	NA	INTRO	Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood, CA) highlighted several biological pathways, particularly the complement system and atherosclerotic signaling, to be enriched in the resulting set of 90 genes (Table 3, Supplementary Table 9).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	To account for features of genomewide association studies (such as the different number of SNPs in each gene), we carried out two additional analyses.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	First, we repeated our analysis for 50 sets of 19 control loci drawn from the NHGRI GWAS catalog.
0	atherosclerotic	NA	NA	INTRO	In these 50 control sets, Ingenuity enrichment p-values for the complement system and for atherosclerosis signaling genes were exceeded 16% and 32% of the time respectively (although these two specific pathways were never implicated in a control dataset).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We also repeated our enrichment analyses using the INRICH tool, which is specifically designed for the analysis of genomewide association studies - but accesses a more limited set of annotations.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The INRICH analyses showed enrichment for genes encoding collagen and extra-cellular region proteins (both with p=10-5 and after adjustment for multiple testing padjust=.0006), complement and coagulation cascades (p=.0002, padjust=.03), lipoprotein metabolism (p=.0003, padjust=.04), and regulation of apoptosis (p=.0009, padjust=.09) (Supplementary Table 10)
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	To explore the connections between our genetic association signals, we tested for interaction between pairs of risk alleles - looking for situations where joint risk was different than expected based on marginal effects.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	This analysis resulted in 171 tests of interaction, of which 9 were nominally significant (p<.05, see Supplementary Table 11), consistent with chance expectations.
1	NA	CFH	rs10737680	INTRO	The strongest observed interaction involved risk alleles at rs10737680 (near CFH) and rs429608 (near C2/CFB), the only association that remained significant after adjusting for multiple testing (p=.000052, <0.05/171=.00029).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Individuals carrying risk alleles at both these loci where at slightly higher risk of disease than expected
0	AMD	NA	NA	INTRO	The proportion of the variability in the risk of AMD that is due to genes, or heritability, has been estimated at 45-70% 2.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Estimating the proportion of disease risk explained by the susceptibility loci identified  depends greatly on the disease prevalence - which is difficult to estimate in our sample, as it includes cases and controls of different ages and collected through a variety of ascertainment schemes.
0	AMD	NA	NA	INTRO	Using a model that assumes an underlying normally distributed but unobserved disease risk score or liability, the nineteen loci described here account for between 10% (if AMD prevalence is close to 1%) and 30% (if AMD prevalence is closer to 10%) of the variability in disease risk (corresponding to 15-65% of the total genetic contribution to AMD).
0	AMD	NA	NA	INTRO	The variants representing the peak of association at loci previously reaching genomewide significance account for the bulk of this variability: the new loci identified here account for 0.5-1.0% of the total heritability of AMD whereas secondary signals at novel and known loci account for 1.5-3.0% of the total heritability
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We report here the most comprehensive genetic association study of macular degeneration yet conducted, involving 18 international research groups, and a large set of cases and controls.
0	AMD	NA	NA	INTRO	Our data reveal 19 susceptibility loci, including 7 loci reaching p<5x10-8 for the first time, nearly doubling the number of known AMD loci outside the complement pathway.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Our results show some susceptibility alleles exhibit different association across ethnic groups and may be preferentially associated with specific subtypes of disease.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	As with other GWAS meta-analysis, differences in genotyping methods, quality control steps and imputation strategies between samples might have a minor effect in our results - future studies may document that more uniform approaches across larger sample sizes might uncover more signals.
0	advanced disease	NA	NA	INTRO	A conundrum of macular degeneration genetics remains that the loci identified to date contribute to both GA and NV, two different phenotypes of advanced disease.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In our sample, subtype specific GWAS analyses considering GA or NV cases only did not identify additional loci.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Consistent with observations for other complex diseases, the majority of common disease susceptibility alleles do not alter protein sequences and are not associated with insertions or deletions of coding sequence or with copy number variation.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We expect that the loci identified here will provide an ideal starting point for studies of rare variation
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In contrast to most other complex diseases, a risk score combining information across our 19 loci, can distinguish cases and controls relatively well (Figure 4, area under the ROC curve [AUC]=.52 including only new loci or AUC=.74 including new and previously reported loci; Supplementary Figure 4).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	It may be possible to use similar scores to identify and prioritize at risk individuals so they receive preventative treatment prior to the onset of disease.
0	neovascular disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Monotherapies are increasingly utilized to manage neovascular disease, but offer only a limited repertoire of treatment options to patients.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Identification of novel genes and pathways enables us to pursue a larger range of disease-specific targets for development of new therapeutic interventions.
0	AMD	NA	NA	INTRO	We expect that future therapies directed at earlier stages of the disease process will allow patients to retain visual function for longer periods, improving the quality of life for individuals with AMD
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Genotyping was performed on a variety of different platforms summarized in Supplementary Table 2.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Each group submitted results from association tests using genotyped and imputed data where the allelic dosages were computed with either MACH, IMPUTE, BEAGLE, or snpStats using the HapMap2 reference panels.
0	NA	VRF	NA	METHODS	The CEU panel was used as a reference for imputation-based analyses for most samples (predominantly of European ancestry), with two exceptions: for the JAREDS samples (predominantly of East Asian ancestry), the CHB+JPT panel was used as a reference; for the VRF samples (predominantly of South Asian ancestry) the combined CEU and CHB+JPT panels were used.
0	AMD	NA	NA	METHODS	For most data sets association tests were run under a logistic regression model using either Plink, Mach2dat, ProbABEL, or snpStats, though for one dataset containing related individuals the generalized estimating equations algorithm as implemented in R. In addition to the primary analysis which tested for SNP associations with advanced AMD unadjusted for age, an age-adjusted sensitivity analysis was conducted by each group with available age.

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	For all analyses, study-specific control for population stratification was conducted (Supplementary Table 4)
0	insufficient	NA	NA	METHODS	Genotyping of the selected SNPs was performed on different platforms; the same models, sensitivity and stratified analyses were computed by each follow-up partner, while SNPs with insufficient call rate were excluded based on study-specific thresholds.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	If the index SNP could not be genotyped, a highly correlated proxy was used whenever possible (Supplementary Tables 2&3)
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Before meta-analysis, all study-specific files underwent quality control procedures to check for completeness and plausible descriptive statistics on all variables as well as for compliance of allele frequencies with HapMap.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	In addition, we excluded SNP results of a study into meta-analysis (i) for discovery: if imputation quality measures were too low (MACH & PLINK <0.3; SNPTEST <0.4) or if effect sizes ( beta ) or standard errors were too extreme (>=5) indicating instability of the estimates, (ii) for follow-up: if Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was violated (p<0.05/32)
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	For both discovery and follow-up, we performed meta-analyses using the inverse variance weighted fixed effect model, which pools the effect size and standard error of each participated GWAS.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Using an alternative weighted z-score method, which is based on a weighted sum of z-score statistics, we obtained a very similar set of test statistics (correlation of -log10(p-value) >0.98).
