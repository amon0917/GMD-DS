0	breast cancer	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Breast cancer exhibits familial aggregation, consistent with variation in genetic susceptibility to the disease.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Known susceptibility genes account for less than 25% of the familial risk of breast cancer, and the residual genetic variance is likely to be due to variants conferring more moderate risks.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	To identify further susceptibility alleles, we conducted a two-stage genome-wide association study in 4,398 breast cancer cases and 4,316 controls, followed by a third stage in which 30 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were tested for confirmation in 21,860 cases and 22,578 controls from 22 studies.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	We used 227,876 SNPs that were estimated to correlate with 77% of known common SNPs in Europeans at r2>0.5.
0	breast cancer	P<10-7	NA	ABSTRACT	SNPs in five novel independent loci exhibited strong and consistent evidence of association with breast cancer (P<10-7).
1	NA	FGFR2	NA	ABSTRACT	Four of these contain plausible causative genes (FGFR2, TNRC9, MAP3K1 and LSP1).
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	At the second stage, 1,792 SNPs were significant at the P<0.05 level compared with an estimated 1,343 that would be expected by chance, indicating that many additional common susceptibility alleles may be identifiable by this approach
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Breast cancer is about twice as common in the first-degree relatives of women with the disease as in the general population, consistent with variation in genetic susceptibility to the disease.
0	breast cancer	BRCA1	NA	INTRO	In the 1990s, two major susceptibility genes for breast cancer, BRCA1 and BRCA2, were identified.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Inherited mutations in these genes lead to a high risk of breast and other cancers.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	However, the majority of multiple case breast cancer families do not segregate mutations in these genes.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Subsequent genetic linkage studies have failed to identify further major breast cancer genes.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	These observations have led to the proposal that breast cancer susceptibility is largely 'polygenic': that is, susceptibility is conferred by a large number of loci, each with a small effect on breast cancer risk.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	This model is consistent with the observed patterns of familial aggregation of breast cancer.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	However, progress in identifying the relevant loci has been slow.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	As linkage studies lack power to detect alleles with moderate effects on risk, large case-control association studies are required.
0	breast cancer	CHEK2	NA	INTRO	Such studies have identified variants in the DNA repair genes CHEK2, ATM, BRIP1 and PALB2 that confer an approximately twofold risk of breast cancer, but these variants are rare in the population.
0	breast cancer	CASP8	NA	INTRO	A recent study has shown that a common coding variant in CASP8 is associated with a moderate reduction in breast cancer risk.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	After accounting for all the known breast cancer loci, more than 75% of the familial risk of the disease remains unexplained
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Recent technological advances have provided platforms that allow hundreds of thousands of SNPs to be analysed in association studies, thus providing a basis for identifying moderate risk alleles without prior knowledge of position or function.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	It has been estimated that there are 7 million common SNPs in the human genome (with minor allele frequency, m.a.f., >5%).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	However, because recombination tends to occur at distinct 'hot-spots', neighbouring polymorphisms are often strongly correlated (in 'linkage disequilibrium', LD) with each other.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The majority of common genetic variants can therefore be evaluated for association using a few hundred thousand SNPs as tags for all the other variants.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	We aimed to identify further breast cancer susceptibility loci in a three-stage association study.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In the first stage, we used a panel of 266,722 SNPs, selected to tag known common variants across the entire genome.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	These SNPs were genotyped in 408 breast cancer cases and 400 controls from the UK; data were analysed for 390 cases and 364 controls genotyped for >=80% of the SNPs.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	The cases were selected to have a strong family history of breast cancer, equivalent to at least two affected female first-degree relatives, because such cases are more likely to carry susceptibility alleles.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Initally, we analysed 227,876 SNPs (85%) with genotypes on at least 80% of the subjects.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We estimate that these SNPs are correlated with 58% of common SNPs in the HapMap CEPH/CEU (Utah residents with ancestry from northern and western Europe) samples at r2>0.8, and 77% at r2>0.5 (mean r2=0.75; see Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	1) (http://www.hapmap.org/).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	As expected, coverage was strongly related to m.a.f.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	: 70% of SNPs with m.a.f.>10% were tagged at r2>0.8, compared with 23% of SNPs with m.a.f.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	5-10%.
0	NA	p<10-5	NA	INTRO	The main analyses were restricted to 205,586 SNPs that had a call rate of 90% and whose genotype distributions did not differ from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in controls (at P<10-5)
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	For the second stage we selected 12,711 SNPs, approximately 5% of those typed in stage 1, on the basis of the significance of the difference in genotype frequency between cases and controls.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	These SNPs were then genotyped in a further 3,990 invasive breast cancer cases and 3,916 controls from the SEARCH study, using a custom-designed oligonucleotide array.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In the main analyses, we considered 10,405 SNPs with call rate of >95% that did not deviate from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in controls
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Comparison of the observed and expected distribution of test statistics showed some evidence for an inflation of the test statistics in both stage 1 (inflation factor lambda=1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.04) and stage 2 (lambda=1.06, 95% CI 1.04-1.12), based on the 90% least significant SNPs (Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	1).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Possible explanations for this inflation include population stratification, cryptic relatedness among subjects, and differential genotype calling between cases and controls.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	There was evidence for an excess of low call rate SNPs among the most significant SNPs (P<0.01) in stage 1, but not in stage 2, suggesting that some of this effect is a genotyping artefact (Supplementary Table 1).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	However, the inflation was still present among SNPs with call rate >99% in both cases and controls, possibly reflecting population sub-structure.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We computed 1 degree of freedom (d.f.)
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	association tests for each SNP, combining stages 1 and 2.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	After adjustment for this inflation by the genomic control method, we observed more associations than would have been expected by chance at P<0.05 (Table 1).
1	NA	P<10-7	rs2981582	INTRO	One SNP (dbSNP rs2981582) was significant at the P<10-7 level that has been proposed as appropriate for genome-wide studies
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	In the third stage, to establish whether any SNPs were definitely associated with risk, we tested 30 of the most significant SNPs in 22 additional case-control studies, comprising 21,860 cases of invasive breast cancer, 988 cases of carcinoma in situ (CIS) and 22,578 controls (Supplementary Table 2).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Six SNPs showed associations in stage 3 that were significant at P<=10-5 with effects in the same direction as in stages 1 and 2 (Table 2, Supplementary Table 3, and Fig.

0	NA	P<10-7	NA	INTRO	All these SNPs reached a combined significance level of P<10-7 (ranging from 2x10-76 to 3x10-9).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Of these six SNPs, five were within genes or LD blocks containing genes.
1	NA	FGFR2	rs2981582	INTRO	SNP rs2981582 lies in intron 2 of FGFR2 (also known as CEK3), which encodes the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2.
1	NA	TNRC9	rs12443621	INTRO	SNPs rs12443621 and rs8051542 are both located in an LD block containing the 5' end of TNRC9 (also known as TOX3), a gene of uncertain function containing a tri-nucleotide repeat motif, as well as the hypothetical gene, LOC643714.
1	NA	MAP3K1	rs889312	INTRO	SNP rs889312 lies in an LD block of approximately 280 kb that contains MAP3K1 (also known as MEKK), which encodes the signalling protein mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 1, in addition to two other genes: MGC33648 and MIER3.
1	NA	LSP1	rs3817198	INTRO	SNP rs3817198 lies in intron 10 of LSP1 (also known as WP43), encoding lymphocyte-specific protein 1, an F-actin bundling cytoskeletal protein expressed in haematopoietic and endothelial cells.
1	NA	NA	rs2107425	INTRO	A further SNP, rs2107425, located just 110 kilobases (kb) from rs3817198, was also identified (overall P=0.00002).
0	NA	H19	rs2107425	INTRO	rs2107425 is within the H19 gene, an imprinted maternally expressed untranslated messenger RNA closely involved in regulation of the insulin growth factor gene, IGF2.
1	NA	NA	rs2107425	INTRO	In stage 3, however, rs2107425 was only weakly significant after adjustment for rs3817198 by logistic regression (P=0.06).
1	breast cancer	LSP1	NA	INTRO	This suggests that the association with breast cancer risk may be driven by variants in LSP1 rather than in H19.
0	NA	P<10-7	rs13281615	INTRO	The sixth SNP reaching a combined P<10-7 was rs13281615, which lies on 8q.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	It is correlated with SNPs in a 110 kb LD block that contains no known genes.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The basis of this association therefore remains obscure.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	rs1447295	INTRO	This SNP is approximately 130 kb proximal to rs1447295, 60 kb proximal to rs6983267 and 230 kb distal to rs16901979, recently shown to be associated with prostate cancer
1	NA	FGFR2	rs2981582	INTRO	The most significantly associated SNP, rs2981582, lies within a 25 kb LD block almost entirely within intron 2 of FGFR2.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We found no evidence of association with SNPs elsewhere in the gene (Fig.

0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In an attempt to identify a causal variant, we first identified the 19 common variants (m.a.f.>0.05) in this block from HapMap CEU data.
1	NA	NA	rs2981582	INTRO	These were tagged (r2>0.8) by 7 SNPs including rs2981582.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The additional tag SNPs were genotyped in the SEARCH study cases and controls.
1	NA	NA	rs2981582	INTRO	Multiple logistic regression analysis of these variants found no additional evidence for association after adjusting for rs2981582.
1	breast cancer	NA	rs2981582	INTRO	Haplotype analysis of these 7 SNPs indicated that multiple haplotypes carrying the minor (a) allele of rs2981582 were associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, implying that the association was being driven by rs2981582 itself or a variant strongly correlated with it (Supplementary Table 4)
1	NA	NA	rs2981582	INTRO	Resequencing of this region in 45 subjects of European origin identified 29 variants that were strongly correlated with rs2981582 (r2>0.6) (http://cgwb.nci.nih.gov; Fig.

0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	A subset of 14 variants tagged 27 of these in European (r2>0.95) and Asian (Korean) samples (r2>0.86).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Two variants could not be genotyped reliably.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	This new tagging set was then genotyped in SEARCH and 3 studies from Asian populations; the Asian studies were included because the LD is weaker, providing greater power to resolve the causal variant (Fig.

0	NA	NA	rs7895676	INTRO	The strongest association was found with rs7895676.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	On the assumption that there is a single disease-causing allele, we calculated a likelihood for each variant.
1	NA	NA	rs2981582	INTRO	21 SNPs (including rs2981582) had a likelihood ratio of <1/100 relative to rs7895676, indicating that none of these are likely to be the causal variant (Supplementary Table 8).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Six variants were too strongly correlated for their individual effects to be separated using a genetic epidemiological approach.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Functional assays will be required to determine which is causally related to breast cancer risk
1	NA	FGFR2	NA	INTRO	Intron 2 of FGFR2 shows a high degree of conservation in mammals, and contains several putative transcription-factor binding sites (http://genomequebec.mcgill.ca/PReMod), some of which lie in close proximity to the relevant SNPs.
1	breast cancer	FGFR2	NA	INTRO	We therefore speculate that the association with breast cancer risk is mediated through regulation of FGFR2 expression.
0	NA	NA	rs10736303	INTRO	Of possible relevance is that only three of these variants (rs10736303, rs2981578 and rs35054928) are within sequences conserved across all placental mammals (Fig.

0	NA	NA	rs10736303	INTRO	Of these, the disease associated allele of rs10736303 generates a putative oestrogen receptor (ER) binding site.
0	NA	NA	rs35054928	INTRO	rs35054928 lies immediately adjacent to a perfect POU domain protein octamer (Oct) binding site.
1	NA	FGFR2	NA	INTRO	However, multiple splice variants have been reported in FGFR2, and differential splicing might provide an alternative mechanism for the association.
1	breast cancer	FGFR2	NA	INTRO	FGFR2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is amplified and overexpressed in 5-10% of breast tumours.
1	cancers	FGFR2	NA	INTRO	Somatic missense mutations of FGFR2 that are likely to be implicated in cancer development have also been demonstrated in primary tumours and cell lines of multiple tumour types (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/cosmic/)
1	NA	NA	rs12443621	INTRO	As two SNPs in the TNRC9/LOC643714 locus, rs12443621 and rs8051542, both showed convincing evidence of association, we further evaluated this region by genotyping, in the SEARCH set, an additional 19 SNPs tagging 101 common variants within the entire TNRC9 and LOC643714 genes, based on the HapMap CEU data.
1	NA	TNRC9	NA	INTRO	SNPs tagging the coding region of TNRC9 showed no evidence of association.
1	NA	TNRC9	rs3803662	INTRO	The strongest association was observed with rs3803662, a synonymous coding SNP of LOC643714 that lies 8 kb upstream of TNRC9.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	This SNP was therefore genotyped in the stage 3 set (Table 2).
1	NA	NA	rs3803662	INTRO	Logistic regression analysis indicated that rs3803662 exhibited a stronger association with disease than other SNPs, and the associations with other SNPs were non-significant after adjustment for rs3803662.
1	NA	NA	rs3803662	INTRO	These results suggest that the causal variant is closely correlated with rs3803662.
1	NA	TNRC9	rs17271951	INTRO	Four SNPs in the HapMap CEU data (rs17271951, rs1362548, rs3095604 and rs4784227) that span LOC643714 and the 5' regulatory regions of TNRC9 are strongly correlated with rs3803662, and it therefore remains unclear in which gene the causative variant lies.
1	NA	TNRC9	NA	INTRO	TNRC9 contains a putative HMG (high mobility group) box motif, suggesting that it might act as a transcription factor
1	NA	P<10-7	rs2981582	INTRO	We assessed in more detail, in the stage 3 data, the pattern of the risks associated with the five independent SNPs that reached an overall P<10-7: rs2981582 (FGFR2), rs3803662 (TNRC9/LOC643714), rs889312 (MAP3K1), rs13281615 (8q) and rs3817198 (LSP1).
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	For each of these five SNPs, the minor allele in Europeans was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in a dose-dependent manner, with a higher risk of breast cancer in homozygous than in heterozygous carriers.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Simple dominant and recessive models could be rejected for each SNP (all P=0.02 or less).
1	NA	NA	rs8051542	INTRO	There was a marked difference in allele frequencies between populations, with the risk-associated alleles of rs8051542, rs889312 and rs13281615 being the major allele in Asian populations.
1	NA	NA	rs2981582	INTRO	The per allele odds ratio associated with rs2981582 was significantly smaller, though still elevated, in the Asian versus European populations (P=0.04 for difference in odds ratio).
1	NA	FGFR2	rs2981582	INTRO	This difference is consistent with the hypothesis that rs2981582 is not the functional variant at the FGFR2 locus, and was not seen for SNPs exhibiting stronger evidence in the fine-scale mapping.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	No other evidence for heterogeneity in the per-allele odds ratio among studies was observed (Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	2)
1	NA	NA	rs2981582	INTRO	Three of the SNPs (rs2981582, rs3803662 and rs889312) also showed evidence of association with breast CIS (Supplementary Table 9).
1	breast cancer	NA	rs2981582	INTRO	For rs2981582 and rs3803662, the estimated odds ratios were greater for a diagnosis of breast cancer before age 40 years, but the trends by age were not statistically significant (Supplementary Table 10).
1	breast cancer	NA	rs2981582	INTRO	There was evidence of an association with family history of breast cancer for three SNPs: for rs2981582 (P=0.02), rs3803662 (P=0.03) and rs13281615 (P=0.05), the susceptibility allele was commoner in women with a first-degree relative with the disease than in those without (Supplementary Table 11).
1	NA	NA	rs2981582	INTRO	rs2981582 was also associated with bilaterality (P=0.02).
0	NA	CHEK2	NA	INTRO	The associations with family history and bilaterality are to be expected for susceptibility loci, and are similar to previous observations for alleles in CHEK2 and ATM (refs)
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This study has identified five novel breast cancer susceptibility loci, and demonstrated conclusively that some of the variation in breast cancer risk is due to common alleles.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	None of the loci we identified had been previously reported in association studies.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Most previously identified breast cancer susceptibility genes are involved in DNA repair, and many association studies in breast cancer have concentrated on genes in DNA repair and sex hormone synthesis and metabolism pathways.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	None of the associations reported here appear to relate to genes in these pathways.
1	breast cancer	FGFR2	NA	DISCUSS	It is notable that three of the five loci contain genes related to control of cell growth or to cell signalling, but only one (FGFR2) had a clear prior relevance to breast cancer.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	These results should, therefore, open up new avenues for basic research
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our results emphasize the critical importance of study size in genetic association studies.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	It is notable that none of the confirmed associations reached genome-wide significance after stage 1 and only one reached this level after stage 2.
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	As most common cancers have similar familial relative risks to breast cancer, it is likely that similarly large studies will be required to identify common alleles for other cancers.
1	NA	FGFR2	NA	DISCUSS	The fine-scale mapping of the FGFR2 locus demonstrates that, even with a clear association, identification of the causative variant can be extremely problematic.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, the use of studies from multiple populations with different patterns of LD can substantially reduce the number of variants that need to be subjected to functional analysis
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	As these susceptibility alleles are very common, a high proportion of the general population are carriers of at-risk genotypes.
1	breast cancer	NA	rs2981582	DISCUSS	For example, approximately 14% of the UK population and 19% of UK breast cancer cases are homozygous for the rare allele at rs2981582.
1	breast cancer	NA	rs2981582	DISCUSS	On the other hand, the increased risks associated with these alleles are relatively small:on the basis of UK population rates, the estimated breast cancer risk by age 70 years for rare homozygotes at rs2981582 is 10.5%, compared to 6.7% in heterozygotes and 5.5% in common homozygotes.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	At this stage, it is unlikely that these SNPs will be appropriate for predictive genetic testing, either alone or in combination with each other.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, as further susceptibility alleles are identified, a combination of such alleles together with other breast cancer risk factors may become sufficiently predictive to be important clinically
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	On the basis of the relative risk estimates from stage 3, and assuming that the five most significant loci interact multiplicatively on disease risk, these loci explain an estimated 3.6% of the excess familial risk of breast cancer.
1	NA	P<10-7	rs2981582	DISCUSS	On the basis of our staged design and the estimated distribution of linkage disequilibrium between the typed SNPs and those in HapMap, we estimate that the power to identify the five most significant associations at P<10-7 (rs2981582, rs3803662, rs889312, rs13281615 and rs3817198) was 93%, 71%, 25%, 3% and 1% respectively.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	These estimates are uncertain, notably because the true coverage of HapMap SNPs is unknown.
1	breast cancer	NA	rs2981582	DISCUSS	Nevertheless, these calculations indicate that the power to detect the two strongest associations was high, and suggest that there are likely to be few other common variants with a similar effect on variation in breast cancer risk to rs2981582.
1	breast cancer	NA	rs13281615	DISCUSS	In contrast, the low power to detect rs13281615 and rs3817198 suggests that these variants may represent a much larger class of loci, each explaining of the order of 0.1% of the familial risk of breast cancer.
0	NA	CASP8	D302H	DISCUSS	An example of such a locus is provided by CASP8 D302H, which showed strong evidence of association in a previous large study.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This SNP was tested in stage 1, but the association was missed because it did not reach the threshold for testing in stage 2.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The excess of associations after stage 2 is also consistent with the existence of many such loci.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In addition, because the coverage for SNPs with m.a.f.<10% was low, many low frequency alleles may have been missed.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The detection of further susceptibility loci will require genome-wide studies with more complete coverage and using larger numbers of cases and controls, together with the combination of results across multiple studies.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The present study demonstrates that common susceptibility loci can be reliably identified, and that they may together explain an appreciable fraction of the genetic variance in breast cancer risk

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	For stage 1, genotyping was performed on 200 ng DNA that was first subjected to whole genome amplification using Multiple Displacement Amplification (MDA).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Samples were then genotyped for a set of 266,732 SNPs using high-density oligonucleotide, photolithographic microarrays at Perlegen Sciences.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	For stage 2, genotyping was performed using 2.5 mug genomic DNA.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	These samples were genotyped for a set of 13,023 SNPs selected on the basis of the stage 1 results, using a custom designed oligonucleotide array.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	For both stages, each SNP was interrogated by 24 25-mer oligonucleotide probes synthesized by photolithography on a glass substrate.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The 24 features comprise 4 sets of 6 features interrogating the neighbourhoods of SNP reference and alternative alleles on forward and reference strands.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Each allele and strand is represented by five offsets: -2, -1, 0, 1 and 2 indicating the position of the SNP within the 25-mer, with zero being at the thirteenth base.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	At offset 0 a quartet was tiled, which included the perfect match to reference and alternative SNP alleles, and the two remaining nucleotides as mismatch probes.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	When possible, the mismatch features were selected as a purine nucleotide substitution for a purine perfect match nucleotide and a pyrimidine nucleotide substitution for a pyrimidine perfect match nucleotide.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Thus, each strand and allele tiling consisted of 6 features comprising five perfect match probes and one mismatch
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Individual genotypes were determined by clustering all SNP scans in the two-dimensional space defined by reference and alternative trimmed mean intensities, corrected for background.

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The K-means at each step re-evaluated the cluster membership representing distinct diploid genotypes.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The multiple linear regressions minimized the variance in  within each cluster while optimizing the regression lines' common intersect.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The common intersect defined a measure of common background that was used to adjust the allele frequencies for the next step of K-means.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The K-means and multiple linear regression steps were iterated until the cluster membership and background estimates converged.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The best number of clusters was selected by maximizing the total likelihood over the possible cluster counts of 1, 2 and 3 (representing the combinations of the three possible diploid genotypes).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The total likelihood was composed of data likelihood and model likelihood.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The data likelihood was determined using a normal mixture model for the distribution of  around the cluster means.

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The expected number of significant associations after stage 2 (Table 1) was calculated using a bivariate normal distribution for the joint distribution of the (weighted) Cochran-Armitage score statistics after stage 1 and after both stages, using a correlation of 0.525 between the two statistics (reflecting the weighted sizes of the two studies).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	These calculations were based on the 205,586 SNPs reaching the required quality control in stage 1.
