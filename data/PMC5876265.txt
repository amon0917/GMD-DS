0	diabetes	insulin	NA	INTRO	Type 1 diabetes develops when pancreatic beta cells fail to produce sufficient insulin to maintain euglycaemia.
0	insulin-treated diabetes	insulin	NA	INTRO	C-peptide measurement after a standard meal (stimulated C-peptide) is the primary way to evaluate insulin secretion in type 1 diabetes.
0	NA	insulin	NA	INTRO	However, fasting/random C-peptide measurements are less demanding and feasible to obtain in large population samples.
0	insulin deficiency	insulin	NA	INTRO	The alpha and beta chains of the proinsulin molecule are joined by C-peptide, which is removed during insulin secretion.
0	NA	insulin	NA	INTRO	Therefore, C-peptide is co-secreted with insulin in an equimolar ratio.
0	NA	insulin	NA	INTRO	Unlike insulin, C-peptide undergoes little first-pass clearance by the liver, has a much longer half-life and is not interfered with by exogenous insulin
0	insulin-treated diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	Type 1 diabetes is a heterogeneous disease that can occur at any age.
0	NA	insulin	NA	INTRO	C-peptide levels vary at diagnosis.
1	insulin-treated diabetes	MHC	NA	INTRO	Early-onset type 1 diabetes (age <2-5 years) is associated with rapid beta cell loss, the presence of high-risk MHC type 1 diabetes genetic susceptibility and high titres of autoantibodies compared with late-onset disease.
0	diabetes	insulin	NA	INTRO	A large proportion of people with type 1 diabetes have detectable C-peptide years after diagnosis, indicating that some beta cells are still functional.
0	diabetes	insulin	NA	INTRO	Sensitive assays have detected stimulated C-peptide in 73-100% of people with type 1 diabetes for >=30 years
0	diabetes	insulin	NA	INTRO	C-peptide preservation has been reported to be associated with favourable metabolic and clinical outcomes in type 1 diabetes.
0	NA	insulin	NA	INTRO	Individuals with preserved C-peptide levels maintain better long-term glycaemic control despite a lower exogenous insulin dose per body weight.
0	Diabetes Complications	NA	NA	INTRO	They are also at lower risk for both hypoglycaemia and diabetic complications, which are major health problems.
0	Diabetes Complications	insulin	NA	INTRO	The association of C-peptide with long-term diabetic complications (i.e.
0	retinopathy and nephropathy complications	insulin	NA	INTRO	retinopathy and nephropathy) remains significant after adjusting for long-term glycaemic control, suggesting that at least part of the effect of C-peptide on diabetic complications is independent of its effect on glycaemic control (or, alternatively, that frequency of blood glucose/HbA1c measurements is suboptimal).
0	Diabetes Complications	insulin	NA	INTRO	However, association of C-peptide levels with long-term diabetic complications has not been observed in other studies
0	diabetes	insulin	NA	INTRO	There have been no family/twin studies of C-peptide levels in type 1 diabetes.
0	diabetes	insulin	NA	INTRO	In the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), investigations of detectable stimulated C-peptide levels in participants with type 1 diabetes (n = 98) and their first-degree affected relatives (n = 109) could not reach conclusions because of an insufficient sample size (see electronic supplementary material [ESM] Tables 1, 2).
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	To date, more than 50 type 1 diabetes risk loci have been identified.
0	autoimmune disease	NA	NA	INTRO	The majority are thought to be involved in the immune system, and many are shared with other autoimmune diseases.
0	diabetes	insulin	NA	INTRO	However, there have been no genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of C-peptide in type 1 diabetes (www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas, accessed 1 July, 2017) and candidate gene-association studies have investigated a limited number of genes in small populations with no replication in independent studies.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	It is clear from other diseases that factors for the risk of a disease and its progression can be independent.

0	diabetes	insulin	NA	METHODS	In the analysis of stimulated C-peptide, DCCT participants were divided into three groups (a primary cohort and a secondary cohort with diabetes duration of 1-5 and 5-15 years), since the range of stimulated C-peptide levels differed among the three groups based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria.

0	NA	insulin	NA	METHODS	However, because C-peptide was measured using different assays in the different studies, and effect-size estimates and standard errors were in different units, the other meta-GWAS analyses used the SAMPLESIZE method, which converts the SNP association test p values to Z scores using the direction of effect, and combines Z scores across studies weighting by the study-specific sample size.

1	diabetes	insulin	rs1264813	RESULTS	Five type 1 diabetes risk loci were nominally associated (p < 0.05) with lower stimulated C-peptide at DCCT eligibility: rs1264813 tagging HLA-A*24 (beta [SE] = -0.34 [0.08], p = 2.80 x 10-5), rs151234 (IL27) (beta [SE] = -0.32 [0.08], p = 3.15 x 10-5), rs12971201 (PTPN2) (beta [SE] = -0.13 [0.05], p = 9.38 x 10-3), rs689 (INS) (beta [SE] = -0.18 [0.07], p = 0.011), and rs193778 (DEXI) (beta [SE] = -0.11 [0.06], p = 0.044).
0	NA	insulin	NA	RESULTS	Association of these SNPs with fasting/random C-peptide in the other studies is shown in ESM Table 13
0	diabetes	NA	NA	RESULTS	The SFDR method estimated the proportion of null SNPs (pi0) at 0.91 in the prior type 1 diabetes stratum vs 0.99 in the stratum of the remaining SNPs.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	RESULTS	Setting an FDR control level of 20% yielded four test rejections for prior type 1 diabetes SNPs and no test rejections in the remaining SNPs.
0	NA	NA	rs1264813	RESULTS	The FDR q value estimates were 0.001 for both rs1264813 and rs151234, and 0.17 for both rs12971201 and rs689.
1	NA	insulin	rs61211515	RESULTS	SFDR ranked these four SNPs above rs61211515, the top associated SNP in the stimulated C-peptide meta-GWAS
1	NA	HLA-A	rs1264813	RESULTS	The association of rs1264813 (HLA-A*24) with stimulated C-peptide at DCCT eligibility did not remain significant when rs61211515 (the top GWAS-associated SNP in this region) was included in the model (p = 0.45).
1	NA	HLA-A	rs61211515	RESULTS	Similar results were observed with imputed HLA-A*24; it was associated with lower stimulated C-peptide at DCCT eligibility (beta [SE] = -0.39 [0.09], p = 1.50 x 10-5), but this association became insignificant after adjustment for rs61211515 (p = 0.09) (ESM Table 14).
1	NA	HLA-A	rs1264813	RESULTS	rs1264813 (HLA-A*24) was also nominally associated with fasting C-peptide at DCCT eligibility (beta [SE] = -0.19 [0.07], p = 0.013) but its association with stimulated C-peptide was significantly stronger (p = 0.011).
0	NA	insulin	rs1264813	RESULTS	The rs1264813 association with stimulated C-peptide remained significant when fasting C-peptide was included in the model but not vice versa (Table 2).
0	NA	insulin	rs1264813	RESULTS	rs1264813 was also associated with an increased rate of decline in stimulated C-peptide over time in the DCCT (SNP-time interaction beta [SE] = -0.11 [0.04], p = 6.32 x 10-3)
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	HLA-DR3 (beta [SE] = 0.03 [0.06], p = 0.59) and HLA-DR4-DQ8 (beta [SE] = 0.06 [0.06], p = 0.29) were not associated with stimulated C-peptide at DCCT eligibility.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	HLA-DR3/DR4-DQ8 compound heterozygotes had higher stimulated C-peptide compared with individuals having no copy of DR3 or DR4-DQ8 (beta [SE] = 0.26 [0.11], p = 0.024).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	However, this association did not withstand multiple testing correction (ESM Table 15)
0	diabetes	DQB1	NA	RESULTS	HLA-DQB1 position 57, HLA-DRB1 position 13 or HLA-DRB1 position 71 amino acid variants, which have been reported to independently drive type 1 diabetes risk and explain >90% of the type 1 diabetes-HLA association, were not associated with stimulated C-peptide at DCCT eligibility
0	diabetes	insulin	NA	RESULTS	Of the two type 1 diabetes GRS, only the Onengut-Gumuscu et al type 1 diabetes GRS was nominally associated with lower stimulated C-peptide (beta [SE] = -0.09 [0.04], p = 0.036) at DCCT eligibility.
0	NA	IL27	rs151234	RESULTS	This association did not remain significant after excluding rs151234 (IL27); beta [SE] = -0.07 [0.04], p = 0.085
1	diabetes	insulin	rs559047	DISCUSS	By combining GWAS data from five type 1 diabetes studies including approximately 1300 individuals with stimulated and approximately 3500 individuals with stimulated, fasting or random C-peptide data, we identified association with a locus on chromosome 1 (rs559047) and multiple independent variants in the MHC region
1	NA	ZP4	rs559047	DISCUSS	rs559047 is an intergenic SNP located 700 kb from the nearest gene (ZP4).
0	pancreatic cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	It is not a significant cis-expression quantitative trait locus (cis-eQTL) for nearby genes in any tissue, including the pancreas (www.gtexportal.org, accessed 14 July 2017) or pancreatic islets (http://theparkerlab.org/tools/isleteqtl, accessed 14 July 2017).
0	pancreatic cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, the cis-eQTLs were produced using a limited number of samples (149 and 112 for pancreas and islets, respectively) from non-diabetic individuals.
1	insulin-treated diabetes	NA	rs559047	DISCUSS	rs559047 has not been associated with the risk of type 1 diabetes (ESM Table 16), and variants in this region have not previously been associated with type 1 diabetes related phenotypes
0	diabetes	insulin	NA	DISCUSS	Some SNP associations for C-peptide in type 1 diabetes are different from those for type 1 diabetes.
1	diabetes	MHC	rs559047	DISCUSS	Two of the identified variants (rs559047 on chromosome 1 and rs61211515 in the MHC region) have not been previously associated with type 1 diabetes; while rs9260151 and rs3135002 in the MHC region have been associated with type 1 diabetes.
0	diabetes	insulin	NA	DISCUSS	The variants associated with C-peptide but not with type 1 diabetes may affect gene expression, and fine-mapping and functional studies are required to determine their effects.
1	diabetes	insulin	rs61211515	DISCUSS	However, SFDR analysis suggests that the proportion of type 1 diabetes loci associated with C-peptide is greater than for the rest of the genome; four out of 70 type 1 diabetes loci (HLA-A*24, IL27, INS and PTPN2) that were nominally associated with lower C-peptide levels ranked higher than rs61211515, the top associated SNP in the stimulated C-peptide meta-GWAS.
0	diabetes	insulin	NA	DISCUSS	Nevertheless, the composition and magnitude of SNP effects for type 1 diabetes development vs progression could differ, explaining why there is no significant association between type 1 diabetes GRS and C-peptide
0	insulin-treated diabetes	insulin	NA	DISCUSS	Some limitations include that only fasting/random C-peptide measurements were available for about 60% of individuals, whereas stimulated C-peptide is more appropriate to evaluate insulin secretion in type 1 diabetes.
0	diabetes	insulin	NA	DISCUSS	In addition, individuals from different cohorts were quite different in terms of their age at diagnosis, diabetes duration and other inclusion/exclusion criteria, all of which may influence C-peptide levels.
0	NA	insulin	NA	DISCUSS	C-peptide can also be measured with different methods with different lower limits of detection, and these were not standardised among the studies.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The mean age at diagnosis ranged from 8.3 years in the EDC study to 21.2 years in the DCCT, and the mean type 1 diabetes duration ranged from 5.6 years in the DCCT to 54.7 years in the Joslin 50-Year Medalist study.
0	diabetes	insulin	NA	DISCUSS	Participants from the DCCT, the only study with stimulated C-peptide data, were highly selected as they were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes later in life and had diabetes for a shorter period of time.
0	NA	insulin	NA	DISCUSS	Therefore, the DCCT had a larger proportion of participants with detectable C-peptide compared with the other studies.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This heterogeneity among the cohorts might have reduced the power of the analysis and contributed to non-replication at specific loci
1	NA	MHC	NA	DISCUSS	In conclusion, we have identified a locus on chromosome 1 and multiple variants in the MHC region that are associated with C-peptide levels.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, these associations need to be validated in independent populations.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Further investigations could eventually provide insight into mechanisms of beta cell loss and opportunities to preserve beta cell function
