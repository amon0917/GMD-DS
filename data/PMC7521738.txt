0	genetic diseases	NA	NA	INTRO	In the past two decades, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have evolved as a critical method to detect and characterize genomic loci affecting susceptibility to various polygenic disorders.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	As this important method to detect genetic associations has grown, individuals of non-European ancestries have made up less than 22% of all GWAS.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Individuals of African, East Asian, and Latin American ancestries made up 2.03%, 8.21%, and 1.13%, respectively.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	These populations are similarly poorly represented in GWAS of prostate cancer.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Individuals of European ancestries make up over 85% of discovery GWAS, while individuals of African, East Asian, and Latin American ancestries make up less than 11%, 3%, and 1%, respectively.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Individuals of African American or Latin American ancestries are far more diverse due to more recent genetic admixture compared to individuals with East Asian ancestries.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	This means that individuals who identify as Latin American or African American may have genomes composed of linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks from Africa, Europe, and the Americas.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Admixture and difference in population structure can lead to complexities in studying genetic associations within diverse populations.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Nonetheless, these populations need to be studied to better understand disease risk across the globe.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The lack of representation of non-European populations in GWAS can lead to further health disparities from non-transferable findings across populations.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Since allele and haplotype frequencies differ across populations, susceptibility to disease will vary with these frequencies.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Elucidating this susceptibility has grown increasingly important since many disease risk prediction models lose performance accuracy across populations.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Having accurate models to predict disease risk is especially important for prostate cancer since disease risk is noticeably different across populations
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Prostate Cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and second leading cause of cancer death among African American men; one in seven black men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in his lifetime compared to one in nine white men.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Risk factors for prostate cancer include age, family history of disease, and African ancestries.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	The genetic component of prostate cancer is made of rare variants with high penetrance and many common variants with lower penetrance.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Adding to the complexity of this analysis, prostate cancer is a remarkably heterogeneous phenotype with various molecular and physical classifications.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	While prostate cancer susceptibility is increased in African Americans, prostate cancer risk is poorly understood in individuals of East Asian ancestries.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	The age adjusted incidence rate of prostate cancer in East Asian Americans is nearly three times that of native East Asian individuals.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Better understanding of how alleles specific to East Asian populations influence prostate cancer risk could reveal new underlying disease biology.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Latin American individuals are the least studied of the three populations.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	The lack of representation could be due to low rates of incidence of prostate cancer in Central and South America; however, Latin American countries are estimated to have the second highest increase in risk for the disease by 2040
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Of the 67 published prostate cancer GWAS in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GWAS Catalog, only 16 studies included individuals of non-European ancestries.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	These GWAS have identified 8q24 as a region carrying susceptibility loci for prostate cancer.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	While some fine-mapping of this region has been done in diverse populations, transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) of prostate cancer have not been conducted across diverse populations.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	TWAS serves as a systematic method for integrating expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data from GWAS.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Since TWAS uses gene expression as an intermediate phenotype, it has a functional advantage over GWAS.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	PRACTICAL	NA	INTRO	One of the largest GWAS published up to this point that included over 140,000 individuals of European ancestries was the Prostate Cancer Association Group to investigate Cancer-Associated Alterations in the Genome (PRACTICAL) Consortium.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	PRACTICAL	NA	INTRO	Two of the largest gene-based association studies specific to prostate cancer were TWAS of the PRACTICAL GWAS summary statistics.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	While these studies provided insight into genes associated with prostate cancer in European subjects, they provided little insight into genes affected by ancestry-specific SNPs in diverse populations.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Moreover, broader and more accurate genotype and gene expression imputation panels have been created since the studies in diverse populations were published
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	We seek to better understand the genetic architecture of gene expression for prostate cancer in African American, Japanese American, and Latin American populations.

0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Broadly, the findings of this study confirm previously well-established information about the genetics of prostate cancer in diverse populations; however, our study differs from previous ones since we performed the first TWAS of prostate cancer in these populations using mashr prediction models from GTEx version 8 and diverse prediction models from MESA.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NKX3.1	NA	DISCUSS	Two of the main findings of this study were identifying risk loci at chromosome 8q24 and identifying NKX3-1 as a risk gene for prostate cancer.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Prostate cancer risk at 8q24 has been well characterized to carry SNPs that are population-specific to African Americans.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Previously, up to twelve independent risk signals have been identified at 8q24 in European populations and three significant loci in populations of African ancestries (S2 & S3 Tables)
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our study found four independent clusters of SNPs at this position for the African American study using DAP-G. Two of these four clusters contained SNPs meeting genome-wide significance.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Han et al.
0	NA	NA	rs72725879	DISCUSS	previously identified rs72725879, rs114798100, and rs111906932 to be three distinct significantly associated loci (S3 Table).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	All three of these SNPs met genome-wide significance in our study, however, our DAP-G modeling clustered SNPs differently than in the forward selection modeling of Han et al.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	(Fig 1).
0	NA	NA	rs72725879	DISCUSS	In both studies, rs72725879 was identified as an independent risk signal.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Han et al.
0	NA	NA	rs114798100	DISCUSS	found rs114798100 and rs111906932 to be independent risk loci while DAP-G in our study prioritized rs76595456 as risk signal independent from rs72725879.
0	NA	NA	rs114798100	DISCUSS	Interestingly, DAP-G clustered rs114798100 (PIP = 1.21 x 10-5) with rs76595456 (PIP = .942), and rs111906932 was not assigned to any cluster by DAP-G. rs76595456 appears to be frequently co-inherited with rs114798100 (D' = 0.964 in 1000G AFR) and rs111906932 (D' = 0.975 in 1000G AFR).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The small number of independent signals identified by DAP-G is unsurprising since DAP-G is a more conservative fine-mapping tool that assumes a single causal variant is expected a priori.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This difference could also be attributed to sample size since Han et al.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	had a sample size nearly twice that of our study.

0	NA	EBPL	NA	DISCUSS	EBPL made up the top twenty gene-tissue pairs by lfsr (lfsr ranging from 0.0423-0.153).
0	AFA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	It was the most associated gene reported across all five MESA gene expression prediction populations by both P-value (P = 4.67 x 10-6 in AFA) and lfsr (lfsr = .106 in AFHI).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The highest gene-tissue COLOC P4 value, the probability that the GWAS and eQTL signal are colocalized, was 0.18.
0	NA	PRACTICAL	NA	DISCUSS	In the S-PrediXcan analysis of the PRACTICAL data, the gene did not replicate.
0	NA	PRACTICAL	NA	DISCUSS	This failure to replicate could be attributed to difference genetic architecture across the African American test population and the European PRACTICAL population
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The TWAS of prostate cancer in the Japanese American population revealed four unique genes associated with prostate cancer.
0	cancers	NKX3.1	NA	DISCUSS	The previously discussed NKX3-1 is a well-established tumor suppressor gene whose decreased expression is known to progress the aggressiveness of the tumor.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	COQ10B	NA	DISCUSS	COQ10B has not been associated with prostate cancer previously according to the NCBI GWAS Catalog.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	PLCL1	NA	DISCUSS	PLCL1 has been nominally associated with prostate cancer through a SNP x SNP interaction study.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Neither of these genes replicated in the larger S-PrediXcan analysis.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	FAM227A	NA	DISCUSS	FAM227A provides an interesting situation since it has been previously identified to be associated with prostate cancer in a GWAS of prostate cancer in Middle Eastern populations.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Additionally, it was the only significant gene-tissue pair to be found in prostate tissue.
0	NA	PRACTICAL	NA	DISCUSS	SNPs were not present in the PRACTICAL summary stats to generate a reliably predicted level of expression of FAM227A using S-PrediXcan.
0	NA	PRACTICAL	NA	DISCUSS	Despite having nearly 15 million more SNPs in the PRACTICAL summary statistics compared to our GWAS and TWAS of Japanese American populations, SNPs were not genotyped or imputed at this location on chromosome 22 in the PRACTICAL study.
0	NA	NA	rs16999186	DISCUSS	One of the SNPs in this model, rs16999186, has a divergent allele frequency across Japanese (MAF = 0.114) and European (MAF = 0.0169) populations.
0	NA	PRACTICAL	NA	DISCUSS	Since this frequency in European populations falls near the quality control MAF threshold in the original PRACTICAL study and below the genotyping threshold for the European-specific designed genotyping array, this SNP could easily be missed in larger studies.
0	NA	FAM227A	NA	DISCUSS	FAM227A also lies within approximately 150kB of SUN2 (P = 1.18 x 10-5;lfsr = .108) a gene marginally significant in our MESA-HIS prediction model.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	SUN2	NA	DISCUSS	SUN2 has recently been identified as a gene whose decreased expression has been significantly associated with prostate cancer in Japanese populations
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	CONCL	In summary, this study of 4,769 African American and 2,199 Japanese American individuals identifies potential population-specific risk loci for prostate cancer in people of recent African or East Asian ancestries.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	rs76595456	CONCL	Since its minor risk allele is found only in populations of recent African ancestries, rs76595456 is suggested as a potentially novel risk SNP to prostate cancer in African Americans.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	FAM227A	NA	CONCL	Furthermore, the identification of FAM227A as a potential susceptibility gene for prostate cancer in non-European populations highlights growing need for studies of the genetics of prostate cancer in non-European populations.
0	NA	NA	NA	CONCL	This study's principal limitations were sample size and ancestry matching in gene expression prediction models.
0	NA	NA	NA	CONCL	Sample sizes of under 5,000 African American subjects and nearly 2,200 Japanese American subjects pale in comparison to studies of exclusively European populations that are nearly two orders of magnitude larger.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	CONCL	Considering that African American men are nearly twice as likely to die from prostate cancer as their white counterparts, the need for larger sample sizes of African American subjects cannot be overstated.
0	NA	NA	NA	CONCL	Regarding the gene expression prediction models used, the GTEx version 8 prediction models are the most comprehensive set of prediction models to date; however, they are built exclusively from the transcriptomes of European ancestries individuals.
0	NA	NA	NA	CONCL	Where the models provide accuracy and breadth in capturing common eQTLs, they struggle to predict expression from population-specific eQTLs.
0	NA	NA	NA	CONCL	The MESA prediction models used capture some of the diversity across populations, but they too are limited by sample size (233 African American individuals, 352 Hispanic individuals, and 578 European individuals) and diversity considering there is no model built from transcriptomes of East Asian subjects.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	CONCL	To better understand the genetic processes that underlie prostate cancer in diverse populations, more diverse studies are needed

0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	REF	Reviewer #1: The authors utilize available prostate cancer GWAS data to perform GWAS and TWAS of prostate cancer within 3 racial/ethnic groups.
0	NA	NA	NA	REF	The GWAS seems like an academic exercise as the GWAS results for these 3 populations/studies have already been published.
0	NA	NA	NA	REF	A stronger rationale for doing this and re-publishing the results needs to be provided.
0	NA	NA	NA	REF	They also need to acknowledge previous GWAS analyses of these same data as many studies have been published.
0	NA	NA	NA	REF	The results are also not properly framed with regards to known risk variants or regions.
0	NA	NA	rs7659456	REF	For example, the top SNP in the study at 8q24, rs7659456, is correlated with much stronger signals in African Americans which have been published.
0	NA	NA	NA	REF	It is odd that these other stronger SNPs are not found which suggests issues with the imputation.
0	NA	NA	NA	REF	While the TWAS analysis in these studies is novel, the results aren't particularly interesting as what was found are essentially known eQTL signals with known risk genes

0	NA	NA	NA	REVIEW_INFO	This explains a potential reason that this study was overlooked in our initial literature review
0	NA	NA	NA	REVIEW_INFO	 The results are also not properly framed with regards to known risk variants or regions.
0	NA	NA	NA	REVIEW_INFO	For example, the top SNP in the study at 8q24, y, is correlated with much stronger signals in African Americans which have been published.
0	NA	NA	NA	REVIEW_INFO	It is odd that these other stronger SNPs are not found which suggests issues with the imputation.
0	NA	NA	NA	REVIEW_INFO	Thank you for this suggestion.

0	NA	NA	NA	REVIEW_INFO	"""Previously, up to twelve independent risk signals have been identified at 8q24 in European populations and three significant loci in populations of African ancestries [13, 38] (S2 Table and S3 Table)"
0	NA	NA	NA	REVIEW_INFO	Our study found four independent clusters of SNPs at this position for the African American study using DAP-G. Two of these four clusters contained SNPs meeting genome-wide significance.
0	NA	NA	NA	REVIEW_INFO	Han et al.
0	NA	NA	rs72725879	REVIEW_INFO	previously identified rs72725879, rs114798100, and rs111906932 to be three distinct significantly associated loci [13] (S3 Table).
0	NA	NA	NA	REVIEW_INFO	All three of these SNPs met genome-wide significance in our study, however, our DAP-G modeling clustered SNPs differently than in the forward selection modeling of Han et al.
0	NA	NA	NA	REVIEW_INFO	(Fig 1).
0	NA	NA	rs72725879	REVIEW_INFO	In both studies, rs72725879 was identified as an independent risk signal.
0	NA	NA	NA	REVIEW_INFO	Han et al.
0	NA	NA	rs114798100	REVIEW_INFO	found rs114798100 and rs111906932 to be independent risk loci while DAP-G in our study prioritized rs76595456 as risk signal independent from rs72725879.
0	NA	NA	rs114798100	REVIEW_INFO	Interestingly, DAP-G clustered rs114798100 (PIP=1.21x10-5) with rs76595456 (PIP=.942), and rs111906932 was not assigned to any cluster by DAP-G. rs76595456 appears to be frequently co-inherited with rs114798100 (D'=0.964 in 1000G AFR) and rs111906932 (D'=0.975 in 1000G AFR).
0	NA	NA	NA	REVIEW_INFO	The small number of independent signals identified by DAP-G is unsurprising since DAP-G is a more conservative fine-mapping tool that assumes a single causal variant is expected a priori.
0	NA	NA	rs72725879	REVIEW_INFO	Additionally, we found six clusters in the Japanese American study using DAP-G. Of the 102 SNPs assigned to clusters by DAP-G in either African or Japanese American population, only rs72725879 overlapped across populations (Fig 2).
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	rs72725879	REVIEW_INFO	rs72725879 has previously been implicated in Asian ancestry-specific risk to prostate cancer [14], and is in high LD (r2=0.815) with rs1456315, which was the most significantly associated SNP in the Japanese American GWAS.
0	NA	NA	NA	REVIEW_INFO	In addition, we now include a new supplemental table (S3 Table) containing overlap between our results, and those of the GWAS catalog.
0	cancers	NA	NA	REVIEW_INFO	Of the 12 different prostate cancer GWAS we found with intersecting genome-wide significant SNPs, seven of the studies contained SNPs with P-values more significant than those identified in our analysis.
0	NA	NA	NA	REVIEW_INFO	We attribute this discrepancy to a combination of weaker statistical power due to lower sample size and more stringent imputation filtering in our study.
0	NA	NA	NA	REVIEW_INFO	Below are details further explaining these differences in significance
0	NA	NA	NA	REVIEW_INFO	Hoffman TJ et al.
0	NA	NA	NA	REVIEW_INFO	(2015), which accounts for four of the fifteen SNPs with different P-values used r2 >= 0.3 (compared to our r2 >= 0.8), so there may have been less accurately imputed SNPs in their analysis, potentially inflating P-values.

0	NA	NA	NA	REVIEW_INFO	While the TWAS analysis in these studies is novel, the results aren't particularly interesting as what was found are essentially known eQTL signals with known risk genes
0	NA	NA	NA	REVIEW_INFO	We thank the Reviewer for recognizing the novelty of our TWAS analysis.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NKX3.1	NA	REVIEW_INFO	We acknowledge that NKX3-1 is a well-characterized prostate cancer risk gene regulated by an enhancer at the 8q24 region that replicated in our S-PrediXcan application of the PRACTICAL summary statistics.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	REVIEW_INFO	Besides this gene, the other four genes we discovered (Table 2) are not located on chromosome 8 and have not been implicated as eQTLs in prostate cancer previously.
