0	diabetes	NA	NA	METHODS	We used an algorithm to define diabetes status among UK Biobank participants at baseline (2006-2010) based on self-reported disease, medication and age at diabetes onset.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Participants were genotyped on the Affymetrix UK Biobank Lung Exome Evaluation (UK BiLEVE) Axiom array or the Affymetrix UK Biobank Axiom array.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Quality control and imputation using the Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC) was conducted centrally at the UK Biobank, yielding a total of about 39 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).
0	Type 2 diabetes	NA	NA	METHODS	Out of 24,680 individuals with available genetic data and possible/probable type 1 or type 2 diabetes, we proceeded with 20,644 individuals deemed unrelated with genetic data that passed quality control.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Of these, 4,978 individuals of non-white non-British ancestry were excluded from main analyses but were eligible for secondary analyses where we defined (1) 'European, non-British white ancestry', (2) 'Asian or Asian British ancestry' and (3) 'Black or Black British ancestry' subsets based on self-reported ancestry and being within +-2 SD of the two first principal components of that population (ESM Fig.

0	diabetes	NA	NA	RESULTS	In our analyses of 15,666 individuals with diabetes (3,968 CAD cases and 11,698 controls; ESM Table 1, ESM Table 2), we found genome-wide significant evidence for association with CAD at two loci (Fig.

0	NA	NA	rs74617384	RESULTS	The strongest association was observed in the LPA locus at 6q25 (lead variant: rs74617384) with the T allele (frequency 8.2%) having an OR of 1.38 (95% CI 1.26, 1.51, p = 3.2 x 10-12).

0	diabetes	NA	rs74617384	RESULTS	In our secondary analyses including only 2,316 CAD cases occurring after diabetes onset, the two top variants had similar effect estimates: rs74617384, OR 1.35 (95% CI 1.20, 1.50, p = 1.6 x 10-7) and rs10811652, OR 1.17 (95% CI 1.10, 1.25, p = 1.5 x 10-6).
0	NA	NA	rs74617384	RESULTS	We found evidence of an association (OR 1.35; 95% CI 1.01, 1.79) of rs74617384 with CAD in the European, non-British population, but not in the other ethnic groups (Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	2a).
0	diabetes	NA	NA	RESULTS	Five of 61 previously reported CAD variants were associated with CAD in the population with diabetes at a p value of <0.0008 (ESM Table 3).
0	NA	SORT1	NA	RESULTS	In addition to variants in the LPA and 9p21 loci, variants in the SORT1 and KCNE2 loci were also associated.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Out of the remaining 56 variants, 13 were associated at a p value of <0.05 and 36 additional variants showed the same effect direction and similar effect sizes as in the non-diabetic population (Fig.

0	diabetes	NA	NA	RESULTS	The previously reported association of two variants with CAD in individuals with diabetes could not be replicated for either variant in the present study.
0	NA	NA	rs10911021	RESULTS	The effect estimates were OR 1.01 (0.95, 1.07) for each T allele of rs10911021; and 1.05 (0.97, 1.14) for each G allele of Pro12Ala (rs1801282), respectively.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	RESULTS	Association results were similar using different definitions of diabetes and different definitions of CAD (ESM Table 4)
0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We report the largest genome-wide association study of CAD among individuals with diabetes to date.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	There are three main findings.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	First, we report two genome-wide significant loci (LPA and 9p21) previously linked to CAD in the general population with similar effect sizes.
0	diabetes	SORT1	NA	DISCUSS	Second, among 61 previously identified CAD variants in the general population, two:SORT1 and KCNE2:were significantly associated with CAD among individuals with diabetes.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Moreover, in the diabetic population, 49 of the remaining 56 non-significant variants showed effect directions and sizes consistent with those observed in the non-diabetic population.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Third, we could not replicate findings from previous studies on diabetes-specific CAD loci, highlighting the limitations of small study samples, lack of replication and/or candidate gene-based approaches.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Overall, our study provides evidence that the genetic mechanisms underlying CAD in participants with diabetes are similar to those in individuals without diabetes
0	diabetes	PSRC1	NA	DISCUSS	Our gene-based analyses provided some evidence for association of variation in or near three genes with CAD in the population with diabetes: PSRC1, CYGB and PRCD.
0	NA	PSRC1	NA	DISCUSS	PSRC1 lays within the CELSR2-PSRC1-SORT1 locus, which has been associated with LDL-cholesterol and CAD, where there is convincing evidence for SORT1 being the causal gene.
0	NA	CYGB	NA	DISCUSS	CYGB and PRCD are located in the same locus on chromosome 17, where we also found some orthogonal evidence of a signal in the CARDIoGRAMplusC4D data.
0	NA	CYGB	NA	DISCUSS	The gene CYGB encodes the protein cytoglobin, which is a recently discovered globin expressed in fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells, and is reported to be an important regulator of cardiovascular tone in mice.
0	atherosclerotic	CYGB	NA	DISCUSS	The results of these gene-based analyses need to be replicated in other data sets, but tentatively suggest CYGB as an interesting candidate gene, especially given increasing recognition of the important role of smooth muscle cells in atherosclerosis
0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In this study, we did not detect genetic variants specific to CAD in the population with diabetes.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In our study, power was limited for lower allele frequencies and smaller effect sizes, and so we cannot exclude the possibility that such variants will be detected in larger future studies.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, the general interpretation of our findings is that the genetic architecture of CAD in the population without diabetes and in those with diabetes is largely similar
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Limitations of this study include a limited power in other ethnicities than white British, although it is reasonable to assume that the underlying biology, but not necessarily linkage disequilibrium structure, is similar across ethnic backgrounds.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Another limitation is that individuals in the control group are likely to have subclinical or clinical CAD not captured by our definition.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Such misclassification likely attenuated our estimates and thereby increases the chance of false negative findings and underestimation of effects.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Finally, our study included only participants with previously diagnosed diabetes and a mean age of 63 years, which is rather young for a diabetes cohort.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In the future, when the biomarker data (including glucose and HbA1c) become available in the UK Biobank, it will be possible to extend the current study to those with undiagnosed diabetes
0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our results indicate large similarities between the genetic architecture of CAD in the individuals with and without diabetes.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Larger studies are needed to establish whether there are diabetes-specific CAD loci with smaller effect sizes
