0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease clinically characterized by memory impairment and pathologically characterized by the formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Less than 5% of AD patients can be categorized as early-onset disease (diagnosis before age 65).
0	NA	beta-amyloid (Abeta)	NA	INTRO	The cause for this subset of disease has been linked to gene mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PSEN1), presenilin 2 (PSEN2) (reviewed in) and duplications of APP .
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	The major form of AD, late-onset AD (LOAD), also has a strong genetic component.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Large twin studies have estimated LOAD heritability ranging from 60 to 80 percent.
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	INTRO	APOE is the primary genetic risk factor in LOAD
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	The APOE E4 variant does not account for all cases of AD.

0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In this study, we conducted a GWAS scan in 1034 cases and 1186 controls mostly collected from Pfizer clinical trials.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	We first examined genetic markers associated with disease susceptibility for late-onset AD by combining available GWAS data from Pfizer, Alzheimer's Disease NeuroImaging Initiative (ADNI) and Genotype-Phenotype Alzheimer's disease Associations (GenADA).

0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	A pathway analysis was conducted to take into account the joint effects of multiple variants to complement the single variant analysis for disease susceptibility.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	We also investigated the association of the validated variants with disease progression in AD patients where longitudinal cognitive data are available
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	To identify common genetic markers involved in AD susceptibility and progression, we first conducted a genome-wide association study in 1034 cases and 1186 controls (the re-matched analyzed set included 733 LOAD cases and 792 controls).
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	To this initial data set, we added available genome-wide individual data from ADNI and GenADA to increase the statistical power (a total of 1831 AD cases and 1764 controls).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	All genotyping data were subjected to a strict quality control process including call rates, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) test, sample heterogeneity, gender check (samples with mismatched gender information from the genotype data and the reported gender information from the clinical database were removed from the analysis) and population stratification (only Caucasians were included in the analysis set).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Since limited number of markers are shared between Affymetrix 550 K (GenADA) and Illumina HumanHap 550/610 platforms (Pfizer and ADNI), we imputed the GenADA data set to the non-singleton HapMap SNPs based on the HapMap III reference haplotypes in unrelated Caucasian individuals.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Poorly imputed SNPs (r2 less than 0.3 or minor allele frequency less than 1%) were removed before any further analysis
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	We examined association of single nucleotide polymorphisms with AD disease status (chi2 allelic test) in each cleaned case/control sample set using PLINK (all summary statistics data associated with the Pfizer data set are listed in Table S1).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	No significant population stratification is present in any data set.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The estimated inflation factor lambda, as a measure of population stratification, is 1.04, 1.02 and 1.00 in the Pfizer, ADNI and imputed GenADA sample sets respectively.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We combined evidences from three cohorts using weighted z-score statistics.
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	RESULTS	In addition to markers adjacent to the APOE locus, meta-analysis revealed a number of distinct loci with suggestive association signals with p values less than 1x10-6 (Table 1).
0	NA	CR1	rs3818361	RESULTS	Furthermore, we replicated previously reported associations in CR1 (rs3818361, P = 0.001, OR = 1.22) and PICALM (rs3851179, p = 0.006, OR = 0.87) loci.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The direction of effect for both variants is consistent across each individual sample set (Table 2).
0	NA	PICALM	NA	RESULTS	In addition, the effect of the PICALM variant appears to be confounded by the APOE alleles despite this variant is located at a different chromosome.
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	RESULTS	The variant is no longer significant after we adjust for APOE e4 status in the analysis (p = 0.26).
0	NA	CLU	rs11136000	RESULTS	The distribution of the CLU allele (rs11136000) is not significantly different in cases and controls.

0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We tested the top variants from our GWAS discovery sample set (p<10-6) in an independent Genizon set of 751 cases and 751 controls from the Quebec Founder Population (QFP).
1	NA	apolipoprotein E	rs12989701	RESULTS	Besides SNPs adjacent to the APOE locus, we only replicated the SNP (rs12989701) at the BIN1 locus (p = 0.00216, OR = 1.34).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The SNP reached genome-wide significance level in the combined set (Figure 1).
0	NA	BIN1	NA	RESULTS	We further tested all markers in this region (approximately 500 Kb regions upstream and downstream of BIN1) in QFP and combined all available samples/data (Pfizer, ADNI, GenADA, the replication Genizon samples and the published Harold data set) to fine-map this locus.
0	NA	BIN1	NA	RESULTS	BIN1 resides across multiple linkage disequilibrium blocks in which linkage disequilibrium (LD) within the block is generally higher than the one between the blocks (Figure 2B).
0	NA	BIN1	NA	RESULTS	Three strongly associated markers are all located upstream of BIN1 although other SNPs in high LD with them could extend into the gene region (Figure 2A and unpublished data).
0	NA	BIN1	NA	RESULTS	Limited LD between these markers and markers located in adjacent genes suggests that this association signal is likely to be more closely related to BIN1 although the effect could still due to some long-range haplotypes extending further in the region.
1	NA	NA	rs744373	RESULTS	Interestingly, rs744373 and rs7561528 are in strong LD (r2 = 0.745) while the LD between rs744373 and rs12989701 is quite low (r2 = 0.05) suggesting independent contributions to disease susceptibility.

1	Alzheimer's disease	NA	rs12989701	RESULTS	We conducted haplotype conditional analysis in our discovery data set (1831 AD cases and 1764 controls) to investigate whether the effect of rs12989701 is indeed independent of the previously identified rs744373.
1	Alzheimer's disease	NA	rs12989701	RESULTS	Distributions of rs12989701 alleles are still significantly different between AD cases and controls even after controlling for the rs744373 alleles (P = 0.002).
1	NA	NA	rs744373	RESULTS	Similar results were observed for rs744373 (P = 0.0059) when controlling for rs12989701.
0	NA	BIN1	NA	RESULTS	These results showed that the BIN1 locus contains multiple variants with conditionally independent associations with disease status
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Our initial analysis for disease susceptibility focused on individual SNPs without considering any potential interactions of multiple variants.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The number of potential SNP combinations, however, increases exponentially and becomes impractical for our current GWAS sample size.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We hypothesized that multiple variants in genes in the same pathway may jointly contribute to the association with disease status.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	To test this hypothesis, we employed GenGen, adapted from a pathway analysis tool originally developed to analyze gene expression by adjusting for different gene sizes and the LD between SNPs.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We first tested all the pathways collected in BioCarta and the top pathway in the Pfizer sample set is the Gleevec pathway.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We further tested the top four pathways (family-wise error rate<0.45) identified from Pfizer set in two independent sample sets: ADNI and GenADA.

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	SNPs with an excess of heterozygosity were removed (Het Excess>0.1 and HWE p<0.01).
0	MDS	NA	NA	METHODS	Caucasians were identified based on multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) of the data compare to the CEPH samples in the HapMap dataset.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We adapted the QC procedure from the original GenADA set to accommodate the Affymetrix 550 k platform.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We removed three additional subjects from the analysis set (subject ID 781, 6145 and 2803) who appear to be either admixture or more distant from the cluster formed by the other Caucasian subjects in the population stratification analysis
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	GenADA genotype data (after QC) were imputed using Mach (http://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/mach/,  ) based on reference haplotypes from HapMap III phased data (release 2).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We performed two-step imputation as recommended for large scale studies: the first step to calibrate model parameters and the second step to impute actual genotypes.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Variants with poor imputation quality scores (r2 less than 0.3) and minor allele frequency less than 1% were removed after imputation
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We performed case/control allelic chi-square tests in Pfizer, ADNI and GenADA sample set separately using PLINK (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/purcell/plink/).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We checked the alleles in the association files to ensure that they are consistent across all data sets.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The inflation factor, lambda, was estimated by dividing the median chi-square values by 0.455 (the expected value under the null hypothesis) for each data set.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The resulting p-values were combined across datasets using a weighted z-score approach.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We calculated association test results from the published Harold study based on genotype counts in cases and controls from each individual cohort (US, UK and Germany).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	In the replication study, we analyzed additional genotype data for 104 markers from the Genizon samples.
0	NA	BIN1	NA	METHODS	To refine the association signal at the BIN1 locus, we combined association test results from all studies (Pfizer, ADNI, GenADA, Harold US, Harold Germany, Harold UK, and QFP) across the 500 Kb regions upstream and downstream of BIN1 using the meta-analysis function in PLINK assuming a fixed effect model.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	To test whether SNPs in this region has contribution to disease susceptibility independent of each other, we performed conditional haplotype analysis using PLINK through comparing the alleles/haplotypes that have a similar haplotype background as defined by the SNP of interest
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Disease progression was characterized using the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of boxes (CDR-SB) score.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	METHODS	Longitudinal data were available for 685 AD patients but only 597 subjects with sufficient CDR-SD data up to 24 months are included in the analysis.
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	METHODS	The genotypic effect of a variant on the change over time in the CDR sum of boxes was assessed using a repeated measures mixed model, with covariates of baseline CDR sum of boxes, baseline MMSE, sex, age at baseline and APOE4 status, with genotype and the genotype*time interaction as the factors of primary interest.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	A main-effects model, without the genotype*time interaction, was also fit to the data.
