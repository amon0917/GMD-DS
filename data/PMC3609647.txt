0	NA	NA	NA	FIG	The figure shows the risks at the 5th and 95th percentiles of the combined genotyped distribution as well as minimum, maximum and average risks
0	breast cancer	BRCA2	NA	DISCUSS	In the largest assemblage of BRCA2 mutation carriers, we identified a novel locus at 6q24 that is associated with breast cancer risk, and noted two potential SNPs of interest at Xq26 and 2p22.
0	breast cancer	BRCA2	NA	DISCUSS	We also replicated associations with known breast cancer susceptibility SNPs previously reported in the general population and in BRCA2 mutation carriers.
0	breast cancer	PTHLH	NA	DISCUSS	For the 12p11 (PTHLH), 5q11 (MAP3K1), and 9p21 (CDKN2A/B), we found uncorrelated SNPs that had stronger associations than the originally identified SNP in the breast cancer susceptibility region that should be replicated in the general population.
0	breast cancer	BRCA2	NA	DISCUSS	In BRCA2 mutation carriers, evidence for a breast cancer association with genetic variants in PTHLH has been restricted previously to ER-negative tumors; however, the novel susceptibility variant we reported here was associated with risk of ER+ and ER- breast cancer
0	NA	NA	rs9348512	DISCUSS	The novel SNP rs9348512 (6p24) is located in a region with no known genes (Figure 1).
1	cancers	C6orf218	rs9348512	DISCUSS	C6orf218, a gene encoding a hypothetical protein LOC221718, and a possible tumor suppressor gene, TFAP2A, are within 100 kb of rs9348512.
1	ductal carcinoma	TFAP2A	NA	DISCUSS	TFAP2A encodes the AP-2alpha transcription factor that is normally expressed in breast ductal epithelium nuclei, with progressive expression loss from normal, to ductal carcinoma in situ, to invasive cancer.
1	cancers	TFAP2A	NA	DISCUSS	AP-2alpha also acts as a tumor suppressor via negative regulation of MYC and augmented p53-dependent transcription.
1	breast cancer	TFAP2A	rs9348512	DISCUSS	However, the minor allele of rs9348512 was not associated with gene expression changes of TFAP2A in breast cancer tissues in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data; this analysis might not be informative since expression of TFAP2A in invasive breast tissue is low.
0	NA	GCNT2	rs9348512	DISCUSS	Using the TCGA data and a 1 Mb window, expression changes with genotypes of rs9348512 were observed for GCNT2, the gene encoding the enzyme for the blood group I antigen glucosaminyl (N-acetyl) transferase 2.
0	breast cancer	GCNT2	NA	DISCUSS	GCNT2, recently found to be overexpressed in highly metastatic breast cancer cell lines and basal-like breast cancer, interacts with TGF-beta to promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, enhancing the metastatic potential of breast cancer.
0	NA	BRCA2	rs9348512	DISCUSS	An assessment of alterations in expression patterns in normal breast tissue from BRCA2 mutation carriers by genotype are needed to further evaluate the functional implications of rs9348512 in the breast tumorigenesis of BRCA2 mutation carriers
0	breast cancer	BRCA2	rs9348512	DISCUSS	To determine whether the breast cancer association with rs9348512 was limited to BRCA2 mutation carriers, we compared results to those in the general population genotyped by BCAC and to BRCA1 mutation carriers in CIMBA.
0	breast cancer	BRCA1	rs9348512	DISCUSS	No evidence of an associations between rs9348512 and breast cancer risk was observed in the general population (OR = 1.00, 95% CI 0.98-1.02, P = 0.74), nor in BRCA1 mutation carriers (HR = 0.99, 95% CI 0.94-1.04, P = 0.75).
0	NA	ER	NA	DISCUSS	Stratifying cases by ER status, there was no association observed with ER-subtypes in either the general population or among BRCA1 mutation carriers (BCAC: ER positive P = 0.89 and ER negative P = 0.60; CIMBA BRCA1: P = 0.49 and P = 0.99, respectively).
1	breast cancer	p<10-5	rs619373	DISCUSS	For the two SNPs associated with breast cancer with P<10-5, neither rs619373, located in FGF13 (Xq26.3), nor rs184577, located in CYP1B1-AS1 (2p22-p21), was associated with breast cancer risk in the general population or among BRCA1 mutation carriers.
0	NA	BRCA1	NA	DISCUSS	The narrow CIs for the overall associations in the general population and in BRCA1 mutation carriers rule out associations of magnitude similar to those observed for BRCA2 mutation carriers.
0	breast cancer	BRCA2	rs9348512	DISCUSS	The consistency of the association in the discovery and replication stages and by country, the strong quality control measures and filters, and the clear cluster plot for rs9348512 suggest that our results constitute the discovery of a novel breast cancer susceptibility locus specific to BRCA2 mutation carriers rather than a false positive finding.
0	NA	BRCA2	NA	DISCUSS	Replicating this SNP in an even larger population of BRCA2 mutation carriers would be ideal, but not currently possible because we know of no investigators with appropriate data and germline DNA from BRCA2 mutation carriers who did not contribute their mutation carriers to iCOGS.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, CIMBA studies continue to recruit individuals into the consortium
0	breast cancer	BRCA2	rs9348512	DISCUSS	rs9348512 (6p24) is the first example of a common susceptibility variant identified through GWAS that modifies breast cancer risk specifically in BRCA2 mutation carriers.
1	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Previously reported BRCA2-modifying alleles for breast cancer, including those in FGFR2, TOX3, MAP3K1, LSP1, 2q35, SLC4A7, 5p12, 1p11.2, ZNF365, and 19p13.1 (ER-negative only), are also associated with breast cancer risk in the general population and/or BRCA1 mutation carriers.
0	breast cancer	BRCA2	NA	DISCUSS	Knowledge of the 6p24 locus might provide further insights into the biology of breast cancer development in BRCA2 mutation carriers.
0	breast cancer	BRCA2	NA	DISCUSS	Additional variants that are specific modifiers of breast cancer risk in BRCA2 carriers may yet be discovered; their detection would require assembling larger samples of BRCA2 mutation carriers in the future
0	breast cancer	BRCA2	NA	DISCUSS	While individually each of the SNPs associated with breast cancer in BRCA2 mutation carriers are unlikely to be used to guide breast cancer screening and risk-reducing management strategies, the combined effect of the general and BRCA2-specific breast cancer susceptibility SNPs might be used to tailor manage subsets of BRCA2 mutation carriers.
0	breast cancer	BRCA2	NA	DISCUSS	Taking into account all loci associated with breast cancer risk in BRCA2 mutation carriers from the current analysis, including the 6p24 locus, the 5% of the BRCA2 mutation carriers at lowest risk were predicted to have breast cancer risks by age 80 in the range of 21-47% compared to 83-100% for the 5% of mutation carriers at highest risk on the basis of the combined SNP profile distribution.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	These results might serve as a stimulus for prospective trials of the clinical utility of such modifier panels
