0	breast cancer	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Only two genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been conducted to date to identify potential markers for total mortality after diagnosis of breast cancer.
0	breast cancer	TNM	NA	ABSTRACT	Here we report the identification of two SNPs associated with total mortality from a two-stage GWAS conducted among 6,110 Shanghai-resident Chinese women with TNM stage I-IV breast cancer.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	The discovery stage included 1,950 patients and evaluated 613,031 common SNPs.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	The top 49 associations were evaluated in an independent replication stage of 4,160 Shanghai breast cancer patients.
0	NA	NA	rs3784099	ABSTRACT	A consistent and highly significant association with total mortality was documented for SNPs rs3784099 and rs9934948.
1	NA	RAD51L1	rs3784099	ABSTRACT	SNP rs3784099, located in the RAD51L1 gene, was associated with total morality in both the discovery stage (P=1.44x10-8) and replication stage (P=0.06; P-combined=1.17x10-7).
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for total mortality were 1.41 (95%CI=1.18-1.68) for the AG genotype and 2.64 (95%CI=1.74-4.03) for the AA genotype, when compared with the GG genotype.

1	breast cancer	RAD51L1	NA	ABSTRACT	This study provides strong evidence suggesting that the RAD51L1 gene and a chromosome 16 locus influence breast cancer prognosis
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies among women in many countries, including China.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Despite generally good prognosis for breast cancer patients, wide variation exists in survival, even after accounting for clinical prognostic factors, suggesting that genetic susceptibility may influence breast cancer outcomes.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Over the past 10 years, candidate-gene studies, including our own, have found several genetic variants to be related to breast cancer prognosis.
0	breast cancer	BRCA1	NA	INTRO	These genetic variants are found primarily in breast cancer susceptibility genes (e.g., BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53) or genes involved in drug metabolism (e.g., CYP2D6, NQO1) and tumor microenvironment regulation (e.g., TGFbeta1, VEGF, CCND1, PAI1, MMP7).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	However, very few of these associations have been confirmed.
0	cancers	NA	NA	INTRO	Given that almost all previous studies used the candidate-gene approach, in which only a limited number of genetic variants are investigated and the choice of variant is based on our limited knowledge of the underlying biology of cancer, more comprehensive genomic investigations of breast cancer prognosis are urgently needed.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified genetic variants related to breast cancer risk that have been robustly replicated across populations.
0	cancers	NA	NA	INTRO	Many GWAS-identified genetic markers are located in regions that had never been suspected of being related to cancer susceptibility.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	To our knowledge, only two studies have evaluated genetic factors in relation to breast cancer survival using the GWAS approach and both were conducted among women of European ancestry.
0	cancers	OCA2	rs4778137	INTRO	The first study reported a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the OCA2 gene (rs4778137) associated with total mortality among women of European ancestry with estrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumors at P=5x10-4.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	However, the second study, conducted as part of the Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS) study, found no SNPs with a statistically significant association with breast cancer survival
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Over the past 15 years, we have conducted multiple, large-scale, population-based studies of breast cancer among Chinese women in Shanghai.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Using the data collected from these studies, we evaluated lifestyle determinants of breast cancer survival.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	In addition to the candidate-gene studies reported previously, we recently conducted a two-stage GWAS among 6,110 patients (719 deaths) with stage I to IV breast cancer recruited in the Shanghai studies to identify novel genetic variants associated with breast cancer survival.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	To evaluate the generalizability of our findings to other ethnic groups, we investigated these GWAS-identified SNPs in CGEMS data from 1,145 breast cancer patients (229 deaths) of European ancestry who participated in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS)
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	METHODS	Samples included in this GWAS came from participants of the Shanghai Breast Cancer Study (SBCS) and Shanghai Breast Cancer Survival Study (SBCSS).

0	breast cancer	NA	NA	METHODS	Cancer patients have been followed for survival status and breast cancer recurrence through a combination of record linkages with the Shanghai Vital Statistics Registry and in-person surveys.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Due to a time overlap during recruitment, 1,469 women participated in both the SBCS and SBCSS.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	After taking these overlaps into consideration and excluding patients with stage 0 disease (n=190), those for whom we had no information on survival status (n=185), and genotyping failures due to limited DNA (n=17), a total of 6,110 participants remained in the present study.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The discovery stage of this study included 1,950 participants.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Genomic DNA samples were genotyped primarily using the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	From the discovery stage, two batches of SNPs were selected for replication in an independent set of samples from the Shanghai studies.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	METHODS	Criteria used to select SNPs for validation were: 1) P<=0.001 under the additive model for either the total mortality (overall survival) or breast cancer recurrence (disease-free survival) analysis; for SNPs that are on or close to metastasis genes or genes previous indicated in breast cancer prognosis, the P-value was relaxed to <=0.01; 2) Minor allele frequency >10%; 3) Exhibited high quality genotype cluster plots; 4) In regions where multiple SNPs in linkage disequilibrium (LD) (r2>=0.6) met the above criteria, the SNP with the lowest P value was chosen.

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The average concordance among the QC samples was 99.85% (median: 100%).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The gender of all scanned samples was confirmed.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Genetically identical, unexpected duplicated samples were excluded, as were close relatives with a pairwise proportion of IBD estimate >0.25.
0	MDS	NA	NA	METHODS	Multidimensional scaling (MDS) analyses of pooled data including 210 unrelated HapMap subjects, and our study data showed that all our study participants clustered closely with HapMap Asians.

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	After exclusions, 607,728 SNPs from batch 1 and 613,031 SNPs from batch 2 were available for the statistical analyses used to select promising SNPs for replication.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The genotyping and QC protocols for the CGEMS project are described in detail elsewhere
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Genotyping for the replication stage was performed on the iPLEX  Sequenom MassARRAY  platform.

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	A set of 4,305 SNPs (not in LD) with a MAF>0.35 and at least 100kb apart was selected to evaluate the population structure.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The inflation factor lambda was estimated to be 1.045, suggesting that population substructure, if present, should not have any appreciable effect on the results
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	METHODS	Outcomes of the study were total mortality (for the overall survival analysis) and breast cancer recurrence (for the disease-free analysis).
0	cancers	NA	NA	METHODS	For the overall survival analysis, follow-up time was calculated as the number of days between the date of cancer diagnosis and the date of death or date of last record linkage for survivors.
0	cancers	NA	NA	METHODS	For the disease-free survival analysis, follow-up time was calculated as the number of days between the date of cancer diagnosis and disease recurrence or date of last survey for women who did not have disease recurrence or die of breast cancer.
0	breast cancer	TNM	NA	METHODS	For 62 women who died of breast cancer but were missing information on disease recurrence, we imputed the date for recurrence based on the TNM stage-specific recurrence rate estimated for the current study.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	METHODS	The delayed-entry Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to derive hazard ratios (HR) for total mortality and breast cancer recurrence in association with each SNP with adjustment for age.
0	breast cancer	TNM	NA	METHODS	Additional adjustments for known clinical predictors for breast cancer prognosis, including breast cancer stage (TNM), estrogen/progesterone receptor (ER/PR) status, ever use of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and tamoxifen did not materially change the results.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We also examined the influence of population substructure by adjusting for the first 5 principal components derived based on 196,471 SNPs with a pairwise LD of r2<0.2 that were selected using PLINK.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We observed no appreciable changes in study results (data not shown).

0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Clinical characteristics of study participants are presented in Table 1.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Patients included in the discovery stage were younger, more like to have late-stage disease, lower 5-year survival rates, and to have received chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or tamoxifen than those included in the replication stage.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	RESULTS	These differences reflect differences in study enrollment criteria (the SBCS, contributed the majority of cases to the discovery stage and disproportionally recruited younger women with breast cancer) and, possibly, temporal changes in breast cancer treatment protocols and outcomes
