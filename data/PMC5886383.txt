0	Type 2 diabetes	insulin	NA	ABSTRACT	To identify genetic contributions to type 2 diabetes (T2D) and related glycemic traits (fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and HbA1c), we conducted genome-wide association analyses (GWAS) in up to 7,178 Chinese subjects from nine provinces in the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS).
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	We examined patterns of population structure within CHNS and found that allele frequencies differed across provinces, consistent with genetic drift and population substructure.
1	NA	G6PC2	NA	ABSTRACT	We further validated 32 previously described T2D- and glycemic trait-loci, including G6PC2 and SIX3-SIX2 associated with fasting glucose.
1	NA	G6PC2	rs34177044	ABSTRACT	At G6PC2, we replicated a known fasting glucose-associated variant (rs34177044) and identified a second signal (rs2232326), a low-frequency (4%), probably damaging missense variant (S324P).
1	pancreatic	SIX3	NA	ABSTRACT	A variant within the lead fasting glucose-associated signal at SIX3-SIX2 co-localized with pancreatic islet expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) for SIX3, SIX2, and three noncoding transcripts.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	To identify variants functionally responsible for the fasting glucose association at SIX3-SIX2, we tested five candidate variants for allelic differences in regulatory function.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	The rs12712928-C allele, associated with higher fasting glucose and lower transcript expression level, showed lower transcriptional activity in reporter assays and increased binding to GABP compared to the rs12712928-G, suggesting that rs12712928-C contributes to elevated fasting glucose levels by disrupting an islet enhancer, resulting in reduced gene expression.
0	hypoglycemia	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Taken together, these analyses identified multiple loci associated with glycemic traits across China, and suggest a regulatory mechanism at the SIX3-SIX2 fasting glucose GWAS locus
0	diabetes	insulin	NA	ABSTRACT	Type 2 diabetes risk and levels of glucose, insulin, and HbA1c are heritable traits correlated with risk of other diseases and mortality.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	To identify genetic variants associated with these traits, we studied up to 7,178 men and women from nine provinces in China.
1	NA	G6PC2	NA	ABSTRACT	We found established variants that could affect fasting glucose located in or near genes named G6PC2 and SIX3.

0	NA	insulin	NA	INTRO	To further clarify the genetic contributions to normal variation in glycemic traits in a multi-provincial Chinese population, we performed a GWAS of fasting glucose, insulin, and HbA1c levels and T2D in subjects from the CHNS, using genetic data imputed to 1000 Genomes Phase 3 in up to 7,178 subjects.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We examined the population substructure within the CHNS and evaluated candidate functional regulatory variants at one locus using annotation and in vitro laboratory assays
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	To evaluate population substructure among 8,403 CHNS subjects with genotype data available, we constructed principal components (PCs) using a subset of variants (MAF > 0.05; pairwise LD r2 <0.02 in a sliding window of 50 variants).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Compared to HapMap 3 populations, the CHNS participants clustered closely with the Han Chinese in Beijing (CHB), the Han Chinese in Denver (CHD), and the Japanese in Tokyo (JPT) populations, with greater diversity than any of these populations (S1A Fig).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	A comparison to only the East Asian samples showed more clearly that the distribution of the CHNS extends beyond that of the CHB, CHD, and JPT samples (S1B Fig).

0	NA	insulin	NA	RESULTS	We performed genome-wide association analyses of fasting glucose and fasting insulin levels in up to 8,045,193 genotyped and imputed variants (MAF >0.01) from 5,786 non-diabetic individuals in the CHNS who provided fasting blood samples (S1 Table, S4 Fig).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We also performed a genome-wide association analysis of HbA1c in 7,178 nondiabetic individuals who provided fasting or non-fasting samples.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	In addition, 5,731 unrelated subjects were used to assess variant association with T2D status, including 748 cases and 4,983 controls.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	For each trait, we also searched for additional signals by conditioning on the lead variants (reciprocal conditional analyses).
0	NA	insulin	NA	RESULTS	Overall, a majority of CHNS subjects were female (54%) with a normal BMI (mean = 23.2 kg/m2), and subjects with T2D were older (cases: 59.7 years; controls: 51.2 years) with a higher BMI, higher fasting glucose levels, and higher fasting insulin levels (S1 Table)
1	NA	G6PC2	rs34177044	RESULTS	Analysis of fasting glucose confirmed eight loci previously identified in East Asian and European samples (G6PC2, SIX3-SIX2, PROX1, ABCB11, GCK, KANK1, GLIS3, and TCF7L2; S2 Table), two of which achieved genome-wide significance (rs34177044, near G6PC2, P = 6.9 x 10-12, Fig 2; rs895636, near SIX3-SIX2, P = 2.3 x 10-8, Table 1, Fig 3A, S5 Fig).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	At these two loci, we used stepwise conditional analyses to identify additional association signals at a locus-wide threshold of P <1 x 10-5.
1	NA	G6PC2	rs34177044	RESULTS	Conditional analysis including rs34177044 at the G6PC2 locus revealed a second signal (rs2232326, MAF = 0.04, Punconditioned = 1.8 x 10-9, Pconditioned = 2.0 x 10-6, Fig 2).
1	NA	NA	rs2232326	RESULTS	When conditioning only on rs2232326, rs34177044 was attenuated but remained significantly associated with fasting glucose (Pconditioned = 7.0 x 10-9); the attenuation suggests the two signals are distinct yet not fully independent.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Haplotype analyses (S3 Table) and regression models containing an interaction term with both variants (P = 0.69) do not suggest a haplotype effect between the two signals, providing further evidence that the two signals are separate.
1	NA	NA	rs34177044	RESULTS	While conditional analyses could be influenced by the moderate imputation quality of rs34177044 (r2 = 0.70) in CHNS, genotypes from the 1000 Genomes project show that the minor allele of rs2232326 is only inherited with the major allele of rs34177044 (East Asian LD r2 = 0.04, D' = 1.0).

1	NA	G6PC2	rs2232326	RESULTS	The lead variant in the second signal at G6PC2 (rs2232326) is a missense variant (S324P).
1	NA	NA	rs2232326	RESULTS	Amino acid 324 is located in a helix spanning the cell membrane, and the substitution of a proline for a serine in the middle of a helix may add kinks to the protein.
1	NA	G6PC2	NA	RESULTS	"In addition, both SIFT and PolyPhen predict this variant to be ""probably damaging"", suggesting that it may affect function of the G6PC2 protein."
1	NA	NA	rs2232326	RESULTS	Based on data from 1000 Genomes Phase 3, rs2232326 is rare in all ancestry populations (MAF: African, 0.2%; Admixed American, 0.3%; European, 0.3%; South Asian, 0.3%) except in East Asians (MAF 5%), and it has few (Admixed American, rs34102076; East Asian, rs139014876), to no (African, European, and South Asian) proxy variants (LD r2>0.80).
1	NA	G6PC2	NA	RESULTS	This variant contributed to a significant G6PC2 gene-based association with glucose in Europeans and other protein-coding variants within G6PC2 have been individually associated with fasting glucose levels (e.g.

0	NA	NA	rs492594	RESULTS	In the CHNS, rs492594 was nominally associated with fasting glucose levels (P = 0.002); other previously described coding variants were either monomorphic or did not pass imputation quality control thresholds in CHNS (S4 Table)
1	NA	G6PC2	NA	RESULTS	We examined whether the strength of fasting glucose associations at SIX3-SIX2 and G6PC2 varied by province (Table 2).
1	NA	NA	rs895636	RESULTS	At rs895636 (SIX3-SIX2), the minor allele frequencies (MAF) differed by as much as 0.12 between provinces.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Most of the provinces in which individuals have a relatively lower minor allele frequency (0.35-0.38) showed a stronger association between the variant and fasting glucose levels than similarly sized samples of individuals with higher MAF of 0.43-0.47.
1	NA	G6PC2	rs2232326	RESULTS	The opposite pattern was observed at rs2232326 (G6PC2), for which the province in which the largest MAF (0.09) showed the strongest association with fasting glucose levels.

0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	These expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) datasets were generated predominantly from European ancestry donors.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	GWAS and eQTL signals more clearly coincide when the GWAS variant and the variant most strongly associated with expression level of the corresponding transcript exhibit high pairwise LD (r2>0.80).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	To allow for differences in LD patterns across ancestries in the GWAS and eQTL datasets, we considered GWAS and eQTL signals to be possibly coincident at a less stringent threshold for pairwise LD values (r2>0.60, East Asian 1000G Phase 3).
1	NA	SIX3	rs895636	RESULTS	The association signal for fasting glucose in East Asians at the SIX3-SIX2 locus contained fifteen variants meeting this criterion (lead GWAS variant rs895636 and fourteen variants with East Asian LD r2>=0.60), and the association signal for islet SIX3 expression in Europeans contained 14 variants (lead variant and 13 variants with European LD r2>=0.60) (Fig 3B, S9 Table).
0	NA	NA	rs12712928	RESULTS	One variant, rs12712928, exhibited high LD (r2>0.80) with both the lead GWAS and eQTL variants (Fig 3C).
