0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Control subjects from PLCO previously genotyped at CGR using the Illumina HumanHap550v3 Genotyping BeadChip array were used for groups (A) and (C) (Supplementary Table 5), and did not overlap with control subjects included in PanScan I, II or III.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	CALBG/Alliance 80303 and control genotypes were imputed to OmniExpress SNP content in the same manner as described above for stage 1.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Quality control thresholds and exclusions for sample and loci in the replication are listed in Supplementary Table 5B.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Association results for the replication studies were adjusted for age, sex and study, and a meta-analysis of the three replication groups was performed using the fixed-effects inverse-variance method based on the beta estimates and standard errors (Supplementary Table 6).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	This was followed by a meta-analysis of stages 1, 2 and replication for the 13 SNPs using the same fixed-effects inverse-variance method
0	NA	NA	rs2736098	METHODS	A comparison of the genotyping calls from the imputation of PanScan I and II into OmniExpress array contents and confirmatory TaqMan assays (n= 511 samples from PanScan I and II) yielded an r2 of 0.74, 0.96, 0.56, 0.99, 0.98 and 1.00 for rs2736098, rs6971499, rs7190458, rs9581943, rs16986825 and rs1561927, respectively
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	To identify recombination hotspots, we used SequenceLDhot, a program that uses the approximate marginal likelihood method and calculates likelihood-ratio statistics at a set of possible hotspots.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We tested five unique sets of 100 control samples.
0	NA	v2.1	NA	METHODS	The PHASE v2.1 program was used to calculate background recombination rates, and LD heat maps were visualized using the snp.plotter program.
1	NA	TERT	NA	METHODS	For estimation of recombination hotspots between loci in TERT and CLPTM1L on chr5p15.33, we used the 1000G (version 3) CEU data
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	To estimate heritability explained by common SNPs present on GWAS arrays on the liability scale (lifetime disease risk of 0.015), we used GCTA on a set of LD-pruned SNPs (r2<0.5) that passed the following stringent quality control thresholds: MAF>1%, SNP missing rates <5%, subject missing rate <1%, and HWE P-values >10-4.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Non-autosomal SNPs and pairs of subjects with genetic relatedness >5% were removed.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	These analyses were run separately in PanScan I, II and III, adjusting for age, sex, study (or geographic region in PanScan III) and the significant principal components in each study.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	PanScan III analyses were restricted to participating studies that contributed both cases and controls.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	PanScan I, II, and III results were combined via meta-analysis.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We repeated the analyses restricted to the genome-wide significant SNPs in individuals of European ancestry to estimate the proportion of heritability tagged by these nine SNPs
0	pancreatic cancer	NA	NA	METHODS	We constructed a genetic risk score for pancreatic cancer, incorporating the susceptibility loci identified in PanScan I, II, and III.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	For this analysis, subjects could possess zero to 20 risk alleles, based on their genotypes at the 10 identified loci.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Odds ratios were calculated using multivariable-adjusted unconditional logistic regression with meta-analysis to combine data from stages 1 and 2, as done in the analyses of individual SNPs.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Replication samples were not genotyped for the four susceptibility loci identified in PanScan I and II, and therefore, these subjects could not be included in the risk score analysis.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Subjects with missing genotypes for one or more of the 10 SNPs (n=898) were assigned the most common genotype at that SNP among cases or controls.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	In sensitivity analyses, results were unchanged if these subjects were excluded.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Using 1000 Genomes CEU data, we identified SNPs with r2 >0.7 with our lead SNP.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We used HaploReg v2, a tool for exploring noncoding functional annotation using ENCODE data, to evaluate the genome surrounding our SNPs (Supplementary Table 12).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	In addition, we evaluated cis associations between all new and promising SNPs discovered in this study and the expression of nearby genes in skin biopsies, adipose biopsies and non-transformed peripheral blood samples from subjects of European descent from publically available data sets (Supplementary Table 12).
0	pancreatic cancer	NA	NA	METHODS	Gene set enrichment analysis was also performed for genes in pancreatic cancer risk loci identified in subjects of European descent (in a window of 100 kb centered on the most significant SNP in each locus) based on KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) annotations using GeneCodis3 with reporting of the corrected hypergeometric P-value
