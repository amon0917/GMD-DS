0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies among women worldwide.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Genetic factors play a significant role in breast cancer etiology.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	To date, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified approximately 75 genetic loci to be associated with breast cancer risk.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	With the exception of the studies we have conducted among East Asian women and one study conducted among women of African ancestry, all other published GWAS have been conducted among women of European ancestry.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Genetic risk variants identified to date from GWAS explain only about 10% of familial risk for breast cancer in East Asian women.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Given the difference in genetic architecture and environmental exposures between women of European and East Asian ancestry, additional GWAS need to be conducted among East Asian women to fully uncover the genetic basis of breast cancer risk
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	The current study was conducted as part of the Asia Breast Cancer Consortium (ABCC) to search for additional novel susceptibility loci for breast cancer.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Included in this study are data obtained from 22,780 breast cancer cases and 24,181 controls who were recruited in 14 studies conducted in multiple Asian countries (Supplementary Table 1).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The discovery stage (Stage 1) included two GWAS, in which 5,285 Chinese women (SBCGS-1) and 4,777 Korean women (SeBCS1) were scanned primarily using the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0, which consists of 906,602 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	After applying quality control (QC) filters described previously, 5,152 Chinese women (2,867 cases and 2,285 controls; 677,157 SNPs) and 4,298 Korean women (2,246 cases and 2,052 controls; 555,117 SNPs) remained in the current analysis.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Imputation was conducted for each study following the MACH algorithm using HapMap II release 22 CHB and JPT data (2,416,663 SNPs) as the reference.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Only SNPs with a high imputation quality score (RSQR >= 0.50) were analyzed for associations with breast cancer risk.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In the analyses of data from Chinese and Korean women, a total of 1,930,412 SNPs and 1,907,146 SNPs, respectively, were included.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	A meta-analysis of these GWAS data was conducted using a fixed-effects, inverse-variance meta-analysis with the METAL program.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	There was little evidence for inflation in the association test statistics for the studies included in Stage 1 (genomic inflation factors (lambda): lambda= 1.0426 for SBCGS-1, lambda= 1.0431 for SeBCS1, and lambda = 1.0499 for both studies combined; Supplementary Figure 1).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	When scaled to a study of 1,000 cases and 1,000 controls, lambda1,000 were 1.02, 1.02, and 1.01, respectively
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	To select SNPs for the Stage 2 replication, we used the following criteria: (1) P < 0.05 in the Stage 1 meta results; (2) same direction of association in both Stage 1 studies; (3) no heterogeneity observed between the two Stage 1 studies (P > 0.05 and I2 < 25%); (4) an imputation score of RSQR > 0.5 in both Stage 1 studies; (5) a minor allele frequency (MAF) of > 0.05 in both Stage 1 studies; and (6) not in strong LD (r2 < 0.5) with any of the known breast cancer susceptibility loci or any SNPs we had evaluated previously.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	For SNPs that met the above criteria but were in LD (r2 > 0.5) with each other, we selected only one SNP for replication.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	A total of 4,598 SNPs were selected, and assays for 4,071 SNPs were successfully designed using Illumina Infinium assays as a part of large-scale genotyping effort.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Of the 4,071 SNPs, 3,850 SNPs were successfully genotyped in an independent set of 3,944 cases and 3,980 controls selected from the Shanghai studies (SBCGS-2).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	After QC exclusions, 3,678 SNPs were included in the analyses of 3,472 cases and 3,595 controls
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	For Stage 3, the top 50 SNPs were selected for further replication in an independent set of 14,195 cases and 16,249 controls from 10 studies participating in the ABCC based on the following criteria: (1) P < 0.005 in the meta-analysis of Stage 1 and 2 data and (2) same direction of association in both Stages 1 and 2.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Of the 50 SNPs evaluated in Stage 3, 11 SNPs showed an association with breast cancer risk at P < 0.05 (Supplementary Table 2).
1	breast cancer	NA	rs4951011	INTRO	Combined analyses of data from all three stages identified three SNPs that were associated with breast cancer risk at the genome-wide significance level (P < 5.0 x 10-8): rs4951011 at 1q32.1, odds ratio (OR) = 1.09, P = 8.82 x 10-9; rs10474352 at 5q14.3, OR = 1.09, P = 1.67 x 10-9; and rs2290203 at 15q26.1, OR = 1.08, P = 4.25 x 10-8 (Table 1).
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	The association between breast cancer risk and each of these three SNPs was consistent across the studies included in the ABCC (Figure 1), and none of the tests for heterogeneity were statistically significant (P > 0.05) (Table 1).

0	breast cancer	ER	rs10474352	INTRO	The associations of SNPs rs10474352 and rs2290203 appeared to be stronger for estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer than for ER-negative breast cancer, and the heterogeneity test was of borderline significance for rs10474352 (P = 0.085) (Supplementary Table 4).
1	breast cancer	NA	rs4951011	INTRO	The associations of rs4951011 with breast cancer risk were similar for ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancer
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	We evaluated the three newly identified risk variants for associations with breast cancer risk in European-ancestry women using data from 16,003 cases and 41,335 controls derived from twelve breast cancer GWAS and included in the DRIVE GAME-ON Consortium.
1	breast cancer	NA	rs4951011	INTRO	SNPs rs4951011, rs10474352, and rs2290203 were all associated with breast cancer risk in women of European ancestry at P < 0.05 with the same direction of association as observed in East Asian women (Supplementary Table 5).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	However, the strength of the associations was weaker in European-ancestry women than in East Asian-ancestry women, and the frequencies of the risk alleles were quite different between these two populations
0	cancers	NA	NA	INTRO	We evaluated and annotated putative functional variants and candidate genes in each of the three newly identified loci using data from the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancer project, expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) databases as well as RegulomeDB and HaploReg v2.

1	NA	ARRDC3	rs10474352	INTRO	SNP rs10474352 is located on 5q14.3, 53,078 bp upstream of the ARRDC3 gene (Figure 2b).
1	breast cancer	ARRDC3	NA	INTRO	The ARRDC3 gene is a member of the arrestin gene family and is suspected of playing a role in breast cancer development.
1	breast cancer	ARRDC3	NA	INTRO	A gene cluster at 5q11-q23 that includes ARRDC3 was found to be deleted in 17% of breast cancer tumor tissue.
1	breast cancer	ARRDC3	NA	INTRO	Up regulation of the ARRDC3 gene in a breast cancer cell line has been shown to repress cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and in vivo tumorigenesis.
1	breast cancer	ARRDC3	NA	INTRO	We evaluated ARRDC3 gene expression in 87 breast cancer cases included in TCGA.
1	cancers	ARRDC3	NA	INTRO	The expression level of the ARRDC3 gene was significantly lower in tumor tissue than in adjacent normal tissue (P = 1.88 x 10-18) (Supplementary Table 6).
1	breast cancer	ARRDC3	NA	INTRO	This is consistent with a previous study showing that expression levels of the ARRDC3 gene were lower in breast tumor tissue compared with normal tissue and in metastatic tumor tissue compared with primary tumor tissue.
1	cancers	ARRDC3	NA	INTRO	Furthermore, lower ARRDC3 expression in tumor tissue has been associated with poorer disease-free survival in breast cancer patients.
0	NA	NA	rs10474352	INTRO	A search of RegulomeDB and HaploReg indicated that rs10474352 may be located in predicted AP-1and VDR motifs (Supplementary Table 7), suggesting a potential regulatory role.

1	NA	ARRDC3	rs421379	INTRO	However, rs421379 is not in LD with rs10474352 (r2=0 in both ASN and CEU data), the SNP in close proximity to ARRDC3 that was identified in our study.
0	breast cancer	NA	rs421379	INTRO	Furthermore, in our study, rs421379 had a low MAF (0.03-0.04) and was not associated with breast cancer risk (P = 0.2484 in Stage 1)
1	NA	PRC1	rs2290203	INTRO	SNP rs2290203 is located in intron 14 of the protein regulator of cytokinesis 1 (PRC1) gene (NM_003981) at 15q26.1 (Figure 2c).
1	NA	PRC1	NA	INTRO	This gene encodes the PRC1 protein, which is involved in cytokinesis and is a substrate for several cyclin-dependent kinases.
1	NA	PRC1	NA	INTRO	The PRC1 gene is down-regulated by the TP53 gene, and it is over-expressed in p53-defective cells.
1	breast cancer	PRC1	NA	INTRO	Interestingly, the PRC1 gene is included in a five-gene expression signature that predicted prognosis among breast cancer patients in a recent study.
1	cancers	PRC1	NA	INTRO	The expression level of the PRC1 gene was significantly higher in tumor tissue than in adjacent normal tissue (P = 4.62 x 10-30) among breast cancer cases included in TCGA (Supplementary Table 6).
1	NA	NA	rs2290203	INTRO	Our cis-eQTL analysis using TCGA data showed no association of rs2290203 with PRC1gene expression, but did reveal a correlation with expression of the RCCD1gene, which is 5,712 bp upstream of rs2290203.
0	NA	NA	rs2290203	INTRO	An eQTL analysis of human monocytes has also indicated that rs2290203 is a cis-eQTL for the RCCD1gene.
0	cancers	RCCD1	rs2290203	INTRO	In our study, the rs2290203 risk allele (G) was associated with lower RCCD1 expression in both tumor (P = 3.6 x 10-4) and adjacent normal tissue (P = 0.007) (Supplementary Figure 2).
0	cancers	NA	rs4544218	INTRO	However, these associations were no longer statistically significant after adjusting for the most significant cis-eQTL SNPs (rs4544218 for tumor tissue; rs59278520 for normal tissue), which are in strong LD with rs2290203 (Supplementary Figure 3).
0	breast cancer	NA	rs4544218	INTRO	Variant rs4544218 was not associated with breast cancer risk (P = 0.8925), and rs59278520 was marginally associated with breast cancer risk (P = 0.0518) in the SBCGS-1, Stage 1 samples.
