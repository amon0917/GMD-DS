0	NA	BRCAX	NA	ABSTRACT	In this study, we report the findings of the genetic architecture of BRCAX with novel and redefined candidate loci and their potential impacts on preventive strategy.
0	breast cancer	BRCAX	NA	ABSTRACT	We performed a genome-wide association study involving 1,469 BRCAX cases from the Korean Hereditary Breast Cancer study, and high-risk breast cancer cases (1,482 Asians and 9,902 Europeans) from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	We also evaluated the previously reported susceptibility loci for their roles in the high-risk breast cancers.
1	NA	PDE7B	NA	ABSTRACT	We have identified three novel loci (PDE7B, UBL3, and a new independent marker in CDKN2B-AS1) associated with BRCAX, and replicated previously reported SNPs (24 of 92) and moderate/high-penetrance (seven of 23) genes for Korean BRCAX.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	For the novel candidate loci, evidence supported their roles in regulatory function.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	We estimated that the common low-penetrance loci might explain a substantial part of high-risk breast cancer (39.4% for Koreans and 24.0% for Europeans).
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Our study findings suggest that common genetic markers with lower penetrance constitute a part of susceptibility to high-risk breast cancers, with potential implications for a more comprehensive genetic screening test
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Breast cancer is the most common female cancer worldwide, and its incidence rate is increasing rapidly in Asian populations including South Korea.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	The National Cancer Screening Program in Korea provides mammography tests for screening breast cancer for women aged 40-69 years.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	The effectiveness of this screening program, however, is controversial mainly because the validity of mammography-based test is lower for Asian women than for Caucasians About 4.8% and 11.1% of breast cancers were diagnosed before age 40 and 45, respectively, in the United States between 2005 and 2014.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The proportions of these early-onset cases almost tripled for Korean women during the same period (13.9% and 29.8%), although overall incidence rate is less than a half of that for Western women.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Early-onset breast cancer cases are generally more likely to have higher pathologic grade and to be receptor-negative tumors.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Given the low predictive value of mammography for Asian women, ultrasonographic breast examination might be introduced to improve the validity but at greater cost.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	An effective genetic screening test, if available, might be able to identify women at high-risk of breast cancers for personalized prevention programs.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	So far, to our knowledge, the genetic etiology of high-risk breast cancers is understudied particularly for Asian women with more burdens from high-risk breast cancers
0	breast cancer	BRCA1	NA	INTRO	Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 (hereafter referred to as BRCA1/2), the most important genetic susceptibility markers, account for up to 15% and 30% of the familial recurrence risk (FRR) of overall and high-risk breast cancers.
0	NA	BRCA2	NA	INTRO	Clinical practice guidelines are well-established for BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.
0	breast cancer	BRCA2	NA	INTRO	"Conversely, lack of proper knowledge has left the BRCA1/2 mutation non-carriers' genetic counseling largely unattended, although these non-carriers with strong family history show similar clinical presentations predictive of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers (""BRCAX"" cases), with four-fold or greater lifetime risk of breast cancer than the general population."
0	breast cancer	BRCA2	NA	INTRO	In Korea, breast cancer cases with early-onset (age < 40) or other indications suggesting a strong genetic burden are entitled to BRCA1/2 mutation testing covered by Korean National Health Insurance.
0	NA	BRCA2	NA	INTRO	"The test has found clinically significant BRCA1/2 mutations for only 15.7% of eligible patients (22.3% of examinees indicated by strong family history, and 8.8% by early-onset), to make the understanding of ""BRCAX genes"" a priority."
0	cancers	BRCAX	NA	INTRO	Several studies have been conducted to elucidate the genetic architecture of BRCAX cancers.
0	NA	BRCAX	NA	INTRO	Studies do not have replicated the novel loci from each other, suggesting that susceptibility loci for BRCAX might be population-specific, at least partly.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Asian women might have specific genetic susceptibility for the high-risk breast cancers, but, to our knowledge, no studies have been conducted toward this end
0	breast cancer	BRCAX	NA	INTRO	We conducted a genome-wide search for BRCAX genes involving 1,469 Korean female breast cancer cases who were eligible for the BRCA1/2 test but negative for causal mutations.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Then, we replicated our findings using the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) data.
0	NA	BRCAX	NA	INTRO	We also estimated the role of previously reported susceptibility loci on the risk of BRCAX occurrence.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Finally, we evaluated the impacts and estimated risk of those associated markers on high-risk breast cancers for Asians and Europeans

0	cancers	BRCAX	NA	RESULTS	Generally, replicated variants showed larger risk for BRCAX or high-risk cancers than the previous reports for all breast cancers.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Since the majority of known susceptibility markers were reported from studies of European populations, the number of replicated markers was larger for European cases compared with Korean or Asian cases.
0	NA	BRCAX	NA	RESULTS	However, the sum of %FRR (Sigma%FRR) of each replicated marker was largest for Korean BRCAX cases (29.8%), followed by European high-risk cases (24.0%) and Asian high-risk cases (10.6%).

0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Europeans have more familial cancers probably due to higher prevalence than Asians or inclusion criteria of each study.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	"It is not clear whether two major indications of being a ""high-risk"" type, i.e., early-onset and familial cases have differences in their genetic constitutions."
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In our study, differences in the association and effect size between populations for some variants might stem from the differences in this case composites
1	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	When GRS was re-estimated according to the risk allele counts of FGFR2/TOX3/ESR1, the estimated risk from GRS not only was larger but also showed a steeper increase suggesting an effect modification.
1	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The risk modification according to FGFR2/TOX3/ESR1 was more evident for BRCAX (Korean), partly because of its strict case definitions (Fig.

0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We also evaluated the impact of known and novel susceptibility loci for high-risk breast cancers.
0	NA	BRCAX	NA	DISCUSS	The estimated Sigma%FRR from replicated markers was 29.8% for Korean BRCAX with 24 markers.
0	NA	BRCAX	NA	DISCUSS	"The findings from replicated markers (29.8% FRR) might not be attributed to so-called ""winner's curse"" bias, an inflated impact estimation in the discovery set itself, because the Korean BRCAX served as a replication set."
0	NA	BRCAX	NA	DISCUSS	Three novel loci accounted for 9.6% of the FRR for Korean BRCAX.
0	NA	BRCAX	NA	DISCUSS	The impact of three novel loci on Korean BRCAX cases, however, might be inflated for having used the discovery set on itself.
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Novel candidate loci added 3.0% to Asian, but none to European high-risk cancers.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	When the %FRR of three novel loci was estimated from all types of Asian breast cancers, the estimate decreased to 0.75%, suggesting that these loci mainly account for the genetic risk of high-risk breast cancers
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Sum of FRR (Sigma%FRR) from common variants are considerably compatible between populations: 29.8-39.4% for Koreans, and 24.0% for Europeans, and 10.6-13.6% for other Asians.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	One reason why Sigma%FRR is smaller for Asians might be explained their heterogenic ethnic compositions (In this study, Asian high-risk breast cancer cases consisted of Japanese 28%, Chinese 30%, Asian American 16%, and others 25%).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	If associated markers have not been identical between ethnic groups, some variants more specifically associated with certain populations might be missed.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Moreover, replication was conducted using 92 markers, most of them were reported from studies of European ancestry.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Also, a smaller sample size could be another reason for fewer replicated markers in Asians.

0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	When we performed an analysis including late-onset breast cancer cases (6,130 cases and 6,371 controls), we could have replicated 24 loci (10 consistent, 12 added and two removed loci).
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Whether the difference is attributable to the power or the differences in the genetic susceptibility between high-risk and late-onset breast cancers is not conclusive.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The six additional loci, however, did not show any clues of possible association with high-risk breast cancers (p > 0.3), and we believe the differences in the genetic architecture between sporadic/low-risk and familial/high-risk breast cancers might explain a part of the discrepancy.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Korean data might have shown compatible Sigma%FRR of high-risk breast cancers with Europeans, partly due to their size and stricter definition for cases.
0	cancers	BRCA2	NA	DISCUSS	We believe it might be reasonable to interpret the findings that common variants explain as much Sigma%FRR of high-risk cancers as BRCA1/2 mutations.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We also examined the associations and their impacts on breast cancer predisposition genes with moderate/high-penetrance.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Although imputed markers covered most of the known variants, our approach might have materially underestimated their impacts, and cannot replace the findings from the sequence-based approach
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	A proper genetic screening program for BRCA/BRCAX, if implemented, might contribute to detecting high-risk women for providing personalized screening program such as ultrasonography.
0	NA	BRCAX	NA	DISCUSS	Additionally, it will provide information for consulting the relatives of BRCAX cases.
0	NA	BRCAX	NA	DISCUSS	Findings from our study support the necessity and possibility of developing a new genetic screening for BRCAX.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, our study alone does not provide other important information necessary for effective genetic screening, in particular, estimates of penetrance and predictive values of the test.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Estimating sensitivity and specificity of BRCAX-associated markers are required first in larger data.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Also, this study considered the genetic markers associated with the occurrence of high-risk breast cancer, and their potential implications for detecting high-risk populations.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	To provide evidence that support a new genetic screening program, further data about a reduced mortality rate from breast cancer might be required, but these are beyond scope of ours
0	NA	BRCAX	NA	DISCUSS	We believe that this study confers some advantages over previous BRCAX studies.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	First, the number of test-proven BRCA-negative cases was not modest (n = 1,469), and more than 11,300 high-risk breast cancer cases were included, larger than previous studies.
0	NA	BRCA2	NA	DISCUSS	Second, all the BRCA1/2 mutation status was more accurately identified by standard sequencing analysis of each BRCA1 and BRCA2 exon.
0	cancers	BRCA2	NA	DISCUSS	Third, we selected high-risk cases with genetic burdens using the similar indications as BRCA1/2 mutation test: age of onset, family history, history of other malignancy, and bilateral cancers.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Applying these strict indications might have enabled us to select cases with high genetic burdens.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Fourth, we attempted to re-evaluate the findings from our own GWAS study and previous studies jointly including both common variants in the GWAS catalog, and moderate/high-penetrance genes.
0	breast cancer	BRCAX	NA	DISCUSS	This approach might have provided more comprehensive views on the genetic architecture of BRCAX and high-risk breast cancers.
0	NA	BRCAX	NA	DISCUSS	Similarly, this approach enabled us to estimate the impacts of associated markers on the occurrence of BRCAX for different populations and context.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The impact estimates from our study will confer implications for genetic screening test of high-risk women.
0	NA	BRCAX	NA	DISCUSS	Finally, to our knowledge, this is the first Asian study focused on BRCAX cases, where epidemiologic features suggest unique susceptibility might exist
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This study also has several limitations.
0	NA	BRCA2	NA	DISCUSS	First, exact information about BRCA1/2 mutation status was scarce, and not available for most studies of the BCAC.
0	cancers	BRCA2	NA	DISCUSS	Applying the criteria for high-risk cancers only which were not confirmed to be BRCA1/2-negative might have decreased the power of detecting associated markers.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Nevertheless, this limitation might not have influenced toward increasing false-positive findings in the study.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Second, Asian cases in the BCAC data were limited so that the criteria for early-onset age were relaxed to the age 45, while the same criteria for having family history was applied.
0	NA	BRCAX	NA	DISCUSS	These relaxed criteria in the replication data might have reduced the power to detect susceptibility loci more specific to the BRCAX cases.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	When we estimated the associations for replicated and novel loci using different age criteria for Asian high-risk cases (938 cases for replication set when age 40 was used), direction and strength of associations were largely same with slightly less statistical power: the number of replicated markers and Sigma%FRR of them declined from 14 (10.6%) to eight (9.0%).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, ORs of three novel markers increased and Sigma%FRR increased from 3.0% to 3.8% accordingly.
0	cancers	BRCAX	NA	DISCUSS	Third, even with the sample size of 1,469 confirmed BRCAX cases, our study has limitations in power to newly detect relatively rare alleles (0.01 < MAF < 0.05) because of the scarcity of high-risk cancer cases.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We estimated that the relative risk should exceed 2.5 to be detected as novel with our sample size.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	"Fourth, although this not being the main purpose of our study, when we attempted to replicate the ""moderate/high-penetrance"" variants, the effects might have been underestimated because some of the variants were not exactly identified in our imputed genotype data."
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We believe the estimated impacts from these genes should have been underestimated.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The estimated impact of the common variants, however, is not likely affected by this limitations, because the frequency of the common risk alleles is independent of the rare alleles.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Fifth, the replication analysis of previously reported loci might have inflated as the replication set could include data of the discovery set.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Finally, as the mean age was different by affection status in the discovery set (cases: 40.2, controls: 55.1), the age was not used as a covariate, because we did not observe any difference in allele frequencies between controls (older) and those in the population with same age with cases (younger) (Supplementary Table S1).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	If there are some susceptibility loci which are expressed in an age-dependent manner, those markers could not have considered in this study.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, we believe older controls might be more appropriate in part due to they have lower chance of developing breast cancer compared to younger controls with similar mean age with the cases (40 years old)
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In conclusion, we have identified novel common susceptibility loci from GWAS and replicated some of both common/low-penetrance and rare/high-penetrance variants which were reported previously.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We also evaluated the contribution of those susceptibility loci including ours, to high-risk breast cancers of multiple populations.
0	breast cancer	BRCA2	NA	DISCUSS	Our findings also suggest that high-risk breast cancers, particularly for Asians, might consist of multiple layers with similar importance, including BRCA1/2, moderate/high-penetration genes, and selected common variants with augmented effects.
0	breast cancer	BRCA2	NA	DISCUSS	Our study might add information to consider prevention strategy of early-onset and high-risk breast cancers in Asia, and also to the genetic counseling for relatives of the high-risk breast cancer patients without a mutation in BRCA1/2 genes

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted using EIGENSTRAT, and the first three principal components were used for adjustment.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	METHODS	Since most cases were early-onset breast cancer and cohorts for control recruited adults with a limited age range, mean age was much younger in cases than controls.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Thus, allele frequencies of significant markers were presented by affection status and age groups, rather than adjusting for age
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	For the replication of the initial candidate loci, imputed data of Asian population from the BCAC were used.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The overall description about the BCAC was previously reported and in Supplementary Notes.
0	breast cancer	BRCA2	NA	METHODS	Since most of the cases in the BCAC lack BRCA1/2 mutation information, we included high-risk breast cancers defined as: breast cancer cases diagnosed before or at age 45 or cases with family history of breast cancer in first degree relatives.
