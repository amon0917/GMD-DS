0	Alzheimer's disease	CLU	NA	ABSTRACT	Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have recently identified CLU, PICALM and CR1 as novel genes for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD)
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	In a three-stage analysis of new and previously published GWAS on over 35000 persons (8371 AD cases), we sought to identify and strengthen additional loci associated with AD and confirm these in an independent sample.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	We also examined the contribution of recently identified genes to AD risk prediction
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	We identified strong genetic associations (p<10-3) in a Stage 1 sample of 3006 AD cases and 14642 controls by combining new data from the population-based Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium (1367 AD cases (973 incident)) with previously reported results from the Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGEN) and Mayo AD GWAS.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	We identified 2708 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with p-values<10-3, and in Stage 2 pooled results for these SNPs with the European AD Initiative (2032 cases, 5328 controls) to identify ten loci with p-values<10-5.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	In Stage 3, we combined data for these ten loci with data from the Genetic and Environmental Risk in AD consortium (3333 cases, 6995 controls) to identify four SNPs with a p-value<1.7x10-8.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	These four SNPs were replicated in an independent Spanish sample (1140 AD cases and 1209 controls)
0	NA	BIN1	rs744373	ABSTRACT	We showed genome-wide significance for two new loci: rs744373 near BIN1 (OR:1.13; 95%CI:1.06-1.21 per copy of the minor allele; p=1.6x10-11) and rs597668 near EXOC3L2/BLOC1S3/MARK4 (OR:1.18; 95%CI1.07-1.29; p=6.5x10-9).
0	Alzheimer's disease	CLU	NA	ABSTRACT	Associations of CLU, PICALM, BIN1 and EXOC3L2 with AD were confirmed in the Spanish sample (p<0.05).
1	Alzheimer's disease	CLU	NA	ABSTRACT	However, CLU and PICALM did not improve incident AD prediction beyond age, sex, and APOE (improvement in area under receiver-operating-characteristic curve <0.003)
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Two novel genetic loci for AD are reported that for the first time reach genome-wide statistical significance; these findings were replicated in an independent population.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Two recently reported associations were also confirmed, but these loci did not improve AD risk prediction, although they implicate biological pathways that may be useful targets for potential interventions
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	It is currently estimated that one of every five persons aged 65 years will develop Alzheimer's Disease (AD) in their lifetime, and that genetic variants may play an important part in the development of the disease.
1	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	INTRO	The substantial heritability of late-onset AD is inadequately explained by genetic variation within the well-replicated genes (apolipiprotein E (APOE(RefSeq NG_007084)), presenilin-1 (PSEN1(RefSeq NG_007386)), presenilin-2 (PSEN2(RefSeq NG_007381)), and amyloid beta precursor protein (APP(RefSeq NM_000484)).
0	NA	GAB2	NA	INTRO	Initial genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified putative new candidate genes (GRB2-associated binding protein (GAB2(RefSeq NG_016171)), protocadherin 11 x-linked (PCDH11X(RefSeq NG_016251)), lecithin retinol acyltransferase (LRAT(RefSeq NG_009110)), transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily C, member 4 associated protein (TRPC4AP(RefSeq NM_015638)) and regions of interest (e.g.
1	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	on chromosomes 14q, 10q, 12q) but no locus outside the APOE-region consistently reached genome-wide significance.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	These disappointing results are most likely explained by the modest sample size and hence limited statistical power of early studies to detect genes with small effects.
0	NA	CLU	NA	INTRO	Recently, two large GWAS, the UK-led Genetic and Environmental Risk in Alzheimer's Disease 1 consortium (GERAD1), and the European Alzheimer Disease Initiative (EADI) Stage 1, reported 3 new genome-wide significant loci for AD: within the CLU gene (GenBank AY341244) encoding clusterin (also called apolipoprotein J), near the PICALM gene (GenBank BC073961) encoding phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein, and within the CR1 (RefSeq NG_007481) gene encoding complement component (3b/4b) receptor 1
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	We performed a three-stage analysis of GWAS data to identify additional loci associated with late-onset AD.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Moreover, we sought to replicate genome-wide significant loci, both from the current analysis and previous reports, in an independent case-control population.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Finally, we utilized two large prospective population based studies to assess the improvement in incident AD risk prediction conferred by the recently described loci
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	METHODS	We used a three-stage sequential analysis to identify novel loci associated with late-onset AD (Figure 1).
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	METHODS	Our initial discovery was a meta-analysis combining new GWA data from white participants in the large, population-based Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium, with GWA data from the Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGEN) public release database and the Mayo AD GWAS.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The sample characteristics of the participants contributing to this discovery stage (stage 1) are summarized in Table 1.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Next, we combined results for our most suggestive findings (SNPs with p-value<10-3) with corresponding results in the EADI1 consortium (stage 2).
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	METHODS	Finally, in stage 3, we combined results for the most promising hits in stage 2 (selecting top SNPs from all loci that reached a p-value <10-5) with data from the non-overlapping studies within the GERAD1 consortium (excluding the Mayo AD GWAS, the only overlapping study).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	All participants (or their authorized proxies) in the contributing studies gave written informed consent including for genetic analyses.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Local institutional review boards approved study protocols.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Details of study sample selection for the contributing studies are described in section 2 of the Supplementary material (section 1 lists commonly used abbreviations) and in Supplementary Figures 1A to 1D
0	dementia	NA	NA	METHODS	In each study, dementia was defined using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders revised third or fourth edition (DSM-IIIR or DSM-IV) criteria.
0	dementia	NA	NA	METHODS	Among persons with dementia, all studies used the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria to define AD, and included persons with definite (diagnosis of AD pathologically confirmed at autopsy), probable or possible AD
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The individual studies in stage 1 were genotyped on different platforms as detailed in Table 1.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The EADI1 used the Illumina Quad 6.0 and GERAD1 was genotyped on various Illumina chips.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	In each of the CHARGE cohorts and in TGEN, we used the genotype data to impute to the 2.5 million non-monomorphic, autosomal SNPs described in HapMap (CEU population).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Imputations are needed when one wants to meta-analyze genome-wide association data across studies that have used different genotyping platforms, because the platforms differ in the SNPs genotyped.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Imputation methods and QC filters in each sample are described in the Supplementary material (Section 3)
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	All analyses were restricted to white persons, racial identity being self-defined by the participants (see section 2 of the online supplement for additional details).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We included a few white Hispanics and adjusted for population structure.
0	NA	CHS	NA	METHODS	Since only one of the CHARGE studies, CHS, had a small number of African American participants (n=574 with genotyping) this racial subgroup was too small for independent analysis.
0	NA	CHS	NA	METHODS	Linkage disequilibrium patterns are very different in African persons and this leads to greater uncertainty in imputation, as well as the possibility of false positive associations if data from two racial groups are combined when disease risk differs by race (a phenomenon called population stratification), hence African-American participants in the CHS study were excluded from these analyses.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Each study fit an additive genetic model - a 1 degree of freedom trend test - relating genotype dosage (0 to 2 copies of the minor allele) to study trait.
0	dementia	NA	NA	METHODS	In the CHARGE cohorts, prevalent cases were compared to controls free of dementia at the DNA draw date.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Participants were excluded if they declined consent or failed genotyping.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	For analysis of prevalent events in the CHARGE cohorts and for the case-control data from TGEN and Mayo we used logistic regression models.
0	dementia	NA	NA	METHODS	For the analysis of incident events in the CHARGE cohorts, participants who were free of dementia entered the analysis at the time of the DNA sample collection and were followed until the development of incident AD; participants were censored at death, at the time of their last follow-up examination or health status update when they were known to be free of clinical dementia, and when they developed dementia due to an alternate cause.
0	NA	Cox	NA	METHODS	We used Cox proportional hazards models to calculate hazard ratios with corresponding 95% confidence intervals after ensuring that assumptions of proportionality of hazards were met.
0	NA	CHS	NA	METHODS	In CHS, FHS, and the Rotterdam Study controls contributed one set of person-years to the prevalent analysis and a second, non-overlapping set of person-years to the incident analyses.
0	NA	Cox	NA	METHODS	Under the martingale property of Cox models, the two analyses are independent and their independence was confirmed in simulation studies.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Primary analyses were adjusted for age and sex and any evidence of population stratification.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Details of the screening for latent population substructure in each discovery sample are available in section 4 of the Supplementary material.
0	NA	CHS	NA	METHODS	In addition, CHS also adjusted for study site, and FHS accounted for familial relationships (by employing a Cox model with robust variance estimator clustering on pedigree to account for family relationships) and for whether the DNA had been whole genome amplified
0	Alzheimer's disease	CHS	NA	METHODS	Our stage 1 meta-analysis combined results from nine discrete sources: incident AD in the CHS, FHS, and Rotterdam Study, prevalent AD in the AGES, CHS, FHS, and Rotterdam Study, and the TGEN and Mayo case-control studies.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We used inverse-variance weighting (also known as a fixed-effects analysis) for meta-analysis applying genomic control to each study of stage 1.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	This approach assigns greater weight to more precise (study-specific) estimators; thus greater weight is given to studies, in which a given SNP was genotyped or more effectively imputed, and to studies with larger sample sizes.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Details of meta-analyses are available in the Supplementary material (Section 5).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We retained only those SNP-phenotype associations that were based on results from at least two of the nine discovery samples and where the minor allele frequency was >=2%.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	For stages 2 and 3, we again used inverse-variance meta-analysis but without genomic control adjustment.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We decided a priori on a genome-wide significance threshold of 1.7x10-8 which gives, for a three stage sequential analysis, the same control of false-positives as a single study's use of p<5x10-8.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The 3 stages of meta-analyses were completed in May to August 2009
0	Alzheimer's disease	ACE	NA	METHODS	Significant hits from stage 3 of the discovery phase were replicated in an independent Spanish case-control sample (the Fundacio ACE) of 1140 AD patients (mean age 78.8+-7.9years, 69.9% women) compared to 1209 general population controls (49.9+-9.2years; 52.8% women).
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	METHODS	All AD patients fulfilled DSM-IV criteria for dementia and NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for possible and probable AD.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Both cases and controls were whites.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Further details of the sample are provided in the Supplementary online appendix (section 6).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Genotyping was undertaken using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) coupled to Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Effect sizes for single markers were calculated by unconditional logistic regression analysis using SPSS v13.0.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Replication was completed in October 2009
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	In secondary analyses, we also examined results for previously reported loci.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	For these loci, which included the recently reported loci by the EADI1 and GERAD1 consortia, we restricted our analysis to the previously unpublished CHARGE data.
0	NA	PCDH11X	NA	METHODS	We did not assess the association with PCDH11X since we only focused on autosomal SNPs in these analyses.
1	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We did examine associations with the top 15 candidate genes listed in the Alzgene database (http://www.alzforum.org/res/com/gen/alzgene), as of 8/12/2009 including the APOE/TOMM40/APOC1 locus and 12 genes outside that locus.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Further details of SNPs selected and results for these SNPs are provided in section 7 and in eTable 3 in the Supplementary material
0	Alzheimer's disease	CHS	NA	METHODS	We sought to estimate the impact of recently identified loci on 10-year risk prediction in the general population using the data for prospectively ascertained, incident AD in the two largest community-based cohort studies at our disposal (Rotterdam Study and CHS).
0	NA	PICALM	NA	METHODS	In these analyses, we only included SNPs from the two loci that were shown to be genome-wide significant in previous publications, and that we replicated nominally within CHARGE, PICALM and CLU (<0.05).
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	METHODS	Moreover, the analysis was restricted to incident AD to avoid survival bias and was restricted to population-based samples, because case-control studies may overestimate the effects of the genes if cases and controls were not randomly selected from the populations in which AD risk prediction is to be applied.
1	Alzheimer's disease	apolipoprotein E	NA	METHODS	The improvement in risk prediction was investigated by comparing three sequentially incremental AD risk prediction models that first incorporated age- and sex- alone, and then added data on risk allele status at the APOE, and finally risk allele status at the CLU and PICALM loci.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We did not assess the utility of novel loci uncovered in this paper (using CHARGE as part of the discovery sample) to avoid the risk of overestimating effects by using the same sample for gene discovery and risk prediction.
0	NA	Cox	NA	METHODS	Prediction models were constructed using Cox proportional hazards methods using the R-package survcomp.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	APOEepsilon4 status was included as a discrete variable (0, 1, or 2 alleles) and the other two genetic loci as dosages; all gene effects were examined using additive models.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The accuracy of risk prediction for each model was assessed as the discriminative accuracy, measured by the Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	AUC theoretically ranges from 0.50 (as predictive as tossing a coin) to 1.00 (perfect prediction)
0	dementia	NA	NA	RESULTS	The stage 1 meta-analysis had 8935 dementia-free individuals (age 72+-7 years) of whom 973 developed incident AD over an average follow-up time of 8+-3 years, and 2033 prevalent cases of AD who were compared to 14642 dementia-free controls.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	In this discovery analysis based on the CHARGE cohorts, TGEN and the Mayo GWAS, there was no evidence of spurious inflation of p-values or significant population-stratification (see Supplementary Figure 2 for the quantile-quantile plot comparing the observed and expected p-value distributions).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Supplementary figure 3 illustrates the primary findings from the stage 1 meta-analysis in a Manhattan plot showing genome-wide p-values for all interrogated SNPs across the 22 autosomal chromosomes.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	After stage 1, 2708 SNPs had a p-value<10-3 and were studied in stage 2.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	In stage 2, pooling these results with data from EADI1, 38 SNPs in ten loci had a p-value<10-5.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Finally, in stage 3, the most significant SNPs from these ten loci were meta-analysed with the non-overlapping studies from GERAD1.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The findings of stages 1, 2, and 3 analyses at these 10 loci are presented in Table 2.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Additional details are provided in eTable1, which shows chromosomal location, adjacent genes, sample- and stage-specific estimates of relative risks, 95% confidence intervals and p-values for each of the 38 SNPs selected in stage 2 analyses.
0	NA	NA	rs744373	RESULTS	Figures 2 and 3 are regional association plots for the two SNPs not previously reported to have reached genome-wide significance, rs744373 and rs597668 on chromosomes 2 and 19, respectively.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	In each Figure we show the linkage-disequilibrium (with the index SNP) and stage 1, 2 and 3 association results for the index SNP and stage 1 results for all SNPs within 200kb on either side of the index SNP at that locus, as well as gene locations and recombination rates in the region.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Regional association plots for the other loci listed in Table 2 are presented as Supplemental Figures 4 to 8
1	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	In stage 1, 11 SNPs in the APOE/TOMM40/APOC1 region reached our pre-set threshold for genome-wide significance (see eTable 1 and Supplemental Figure 3).
0	NA	CLU	rs11136000	RESULTS	In stage 2, two additional loci, rs11136000 in CLU, and a locus (rs11771145) at chromosome 7 in the 5' upstream promoter/regulatory region of EPH receptor A1 (EPHA1(GenBank AH007960)) reached genome-wide significance.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	However, the latter became non-significant after adding GERAD1 data in stage 3, though the effect seen in GERAD1 was in the same direction in that the same allele was associated with an increased risk of AD.
1	Alzheimer's disease	apolipoprotein E	rs2075650	RESULTS	In stage 3, genome-wide significant evidence for association with AD was reached at the APOE (rs2075650; p=1.04x10-295), CLU (rs11136000; p=1.62x10-16) and PICALM (rs3851179; p=3.16x10-12) loci, and for two novel loci on chromosomes 2 (rs744373; p=1.59x10-11), and 19 (rs597668; p=6.45x10-9).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Table 2 shows the odds ratios associated with the minor allele for each of these SNPs.
0	NA	BIN1	rs744373	RESULTS	Rs744373 is within 30Kb of the gene bridging integrator 1 (BIN1(RefSeq NG_012042)) (Figure 2), while rs597668 is within 60Kb of six genes including exocyst complex component 3-like 2 (EXOC3L2(RefSeq NM_138568)), biogenesis of lysosomal organelles complex-1, subunit 3 (BLOC1S3(RefSeq NG_008372)), and MAP/microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 4 (MARK4(GenBank BC071948)) (Figure 3)
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We replicated the four associations that reached our preset genome-wide significance threshold (1.7x10-8) in an independent sample of cases and controls (see Table 3).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Effect sizes in the replication cohort were similar to those observed in the discovery sample; each of these associations reached p-value <0.05
1	Alzheimer's disease	apolipoprotein E	rs597668	RESULTS	Since rs597668 is on chromosome 19, fairly close to the APOE locus, we undertook conditional analyses to examine whether its association with AD was independent of APOEepsilon4.
1	Alzheimer's disease	NA	rs2075650	RESULTS	We conducted two analyses with AD (among persons with directly genotyped APOEepsilon4 status) in the CHARGE, TGEN and Mayo sample, adjusting (i) for our strongest association in the APOE/TOMM40/APOC1 locus (rs2075650) and (ii) for the actual APOEepsilon4 SNP, rs429358.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	In each case, we found that the association was attenuated but a marginal signal remained when adjusting for APOEepsilon4 (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.08-1.24, p=3.9x10-4 without adjustment and OR 1.17, 1.07-1.23, p=8.7x10-4, and OR 1.10, 1.00-1.16, p=0.05 for analyses (i) and (ii), respectively.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We also examined the effect of adjusting for age, sex and presence of at least one APOEepsilon4 allele (using a dominant genetic inheritance model) in the Spanish replication sample and here again the results were attenuated (OR 1.24, CI 1.02x1.51, p=0.03).
1	NA	apolipoprotein E	rs597668	RESULTS	These findings are consistent with the moderate to low level of linkage disequilibrium observed between rs597668 and SNPs within the APOE and TOMM40 region (r2<0.01 according to HapMap CEU data, see also Figure 3)
1	Alzheimer's disease	NA	rs6857	RESULTS	In our secondary analyses examining replication of published findings in the previously unreported CHARGE data, 6 intronic or 3' UTR SNPs in the APOE/TOMM40/APOC1 region (rs6857, rs2075650, rs4420638, rs157582, rs6859 and rs10119) reached a genome-wide significance threshold of <1.7x10-8, and we replicated the top SNPs within two out of the three recently reported genetic loci associated with AD in prior GWAS: CLU (rs11136000, OR 0.90, CI 0.82-0.98, p=0.02) and PICALM (rs3851179, OR 0.90, CI: 0.83-0.99, p=0.02); see eTable 1 and the Supplementary methods for additional details.
0	NA	CR1	rs3818361	RESULTS	We did not find a significant association with the top CR1 SNP (rs3818361) in the CHARGE data.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	However 13 SNPs within the gene showed nominal significance (0.001<p<0.05), as shown in eTable 2.
0	NA	NA	rs3818361	RESULTS	Further, adding CHARGE and TGEN data on rs3818361 to the previously reported EADI1 and GERAD1 data - Mayo data were here included in the GERAD1 data - showed that results now reached genome-wide significance (OR 1.15, 1.11-1.20, p=1.04x10-11 (Supplemental Figure 9)
1	Alzheimer's disease	NA	rs4362	RESULTS	Among the 54 SNPs selected from the top 12 candidate genes (outside the APOE/TOMM40/APOC1 locus) listed in the Alzgene website, we found evidence for a nominal association of rs4362 in the angiotensin conversting enzyme (ACE(RefSeq)) gene and rs1784933 in the sortilin-related receptor L(DLR class A) repeats-containing (SORL1(RefSeq)) gene with AD (risks associated with each copy of the minor allele were 0.92, CI 0.85-0.99, p=0.03, and 1.33, CI 1.03-1.72, p=0.03, respectively; eTable 3 in Supplementary material)
0	Alzheimer's disease	PICALM	NA	RESULTS	We assessed the extent to which APOEepsilon4, PICALM and CLU can improve predictive models for risk of incident AD in the general population.
0	NA	CHS	NA	RESULTS	The addition of APOEepsilon4 carrier status to a prediction model including age and sex only, increased the AUC from 0.826 (95%CI 0.806-0.846) to 0.847 (95%CI 0.828-0.865) in the Rotterdam study and from 0.670 (95%CI 0.625-0.723) to 0.702 (95%CI 0.654-0.754) in the CHS study.
0	NA	CLU	NA	RESULTS	Further inclusion of risk allele status for CLU and PICALM improved the AUC only minimally to 0.849 (95%CI 0.831-0.867) in the Rotterdam Study and to 0.705 (95%CI 0.654-0.751) in CHS.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The corresponding Receiver Operating Characteristic curves are shown in Supplemental Figure 10
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We report results of an international three-stage genome-wide analysis to study genetic variation underlying late-onset, sporadic AD.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We studied over 35,000 persons (8371 AD cases), constituting the largest sample analyzed to date.
1	Alzheimer's disease	apolipoprotein E	NA	DISCUSS	In the gene discovery phase we showed genome-wide significance for two novel loci related to AD, one on chromosome 2 and a second locus on chromosome 19 that seems independent of APOE.
0	Alzheimer's disease	BIN1	NA	DISCUSS	We note that BIN1 was previously identified as showing suggestive association with AD in the recent GWAS from the GERAD1; our study now finds the association for the first time to be genome-wide significant, which is a major step forward.
0	NA	CLU	NA	DISCUSS	Furthermore, we replicated both these loci as well as the recently identified loci, CLU and PICALM in an independent sample.
0	Alzheimer's disease	CLU	NA	DISCUSS	Although genetic variation at the CLU and PICALM loci did modify the risk of AD in our population-based sample, and their discovery represents a significant advance in understanding the pathophysiology of AD, these polymorphisms had a very limited impact on prediction of AD risk
0	NA	BIN1	NA	DISCUSS	The locus on chromosome 2q14.3 is adjacent to the bridging integrator 1 (BIN1) gene, which is one of two amphiphysins, and is expressed most abundantly in the brain and muscle.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Amphiphysins promote caspase-independent apoptosis and also play a critical role in neuronal membrane organization and clathrin mediated, synaptic vessel formation, a process disrupted by Abeta.
0	seizures	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Knock-out mice with decreased expression of the amphiphysins have seizures and major learning deficits.
0	Alzheimer's disease	BIN1	NA	DISCUSS	Altered expression of BIN1 has been demonstrated in aging mice, in transgenic mouse models of AD and in persons with schizophrenia
1	Alzheimer's disease	apolipoprotein E	rs597668	DISCUSS	The 19q13.3 locus (rs597668), a site distal to and not in linkage disequilibrium with SNPs in the APOE locus, had been suspected, in an early linkage study, to harbor a gene for AD.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	There are 6 genes adjacent to this locus, two of which are part of pathways linked to Alzheimer pathology.
0	schizophrenia	BLOC1S3	NA	DISCUSS	The protein product of BLOC1S3, called 'Biogenesis of lysosomal organelles complex-1, subunit 3' is expressed in the brain, regulates endosomal to lysosomal routing, and has been implicated in schizophrenia.
0	NA	MARK4	NA	DISCUSS	The second gene, MARK4 or MAP/microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 4, is inducible, expressed only in the brain, and plays a role in neuronal differentiation.
0	Alzheimer's disease	MARK4	NA	DISCUSS	MARK4 is a kinase that phosphorylates tau, is polyubiquitinated in vivo, and is a substrate of the aging-related deubiquitinating enzyme USP9X; hence it may play a role in the abnormal tau phosphorylation seen in AD.
0	NA	EXOC3L2	rs597668	DISCUSS	Little is known of the function of the gene closest to rs597668, exocyst complex component 3-like 2 gene (EXOC3L2), also referred to as protein 7 transactivated by hepatitis B virus X antigen (XTP7) gene
0	Alzheimer's disease	CLU	NA	DISCUSS	When evaluating the added value of the new AD genes in clinical risk prediction, we focused on the 2 recently reported AD genes that were replicated in our population-based studies, CLU and PICALM and found that they minimally improved prediction of incident AD beyond age, sex and APOEepsilon4 based models; the increase in AUC was 0.002 in the Rotterdam Study and 0.003 in CHS.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	There are two reasons for this.
1	Alzheimer's disease	CLU	NA	DISCUSS	First, the associations of CLU and PICALM with AD risk were markedly lower than those of age and APOE, and therefore a major improvement was not expected.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This fits with recent insights on polygenic models that assume there are 10,000s of risk alleles, each with a small (~5% increase in relative risk) effect throughout the whole genome, rather than a discrete number of alleles with moderate effects.
0	schizophrenia	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Such models appear to underlie the susceptibility to schizophrenia risk and a similar model may be applicable to AD.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Second, the extent to which risk factors improve risk prediction depends on the predictive performance of the initial risk model.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Added risk factors need to have stronger effects to improve a risk model with high AUC than to improve a model with lower AUC.
1	Alzheimer's disease	apolipoprotein E	NA	DISCUSS	AD risk prediction based on age, sex and APOE already has very high discriminative accuracy, the AUC was 0.826 in the Rotterdam Study and 0.670 in CHS, which implies that further improvements require many new variants or variants with strong effects.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Whether such improvements are to be expected will depend for a large part on our ability to unravel the underlying genetic architecture and to identify and quantify environmental risk factors, including complex interactions.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The obvious next step for genetic research in AD will be to further increase the sample size of GWAs and evaluate further genetic models
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Strengths of this study include the large sample of clinic and community-based cases and controls and the subsample of prospectively ascertained incident AD that permitted the exploration of incident risk prediction algorithms.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The observed associations are unlikely to be due to population stratification since the discovery and replication samples were restricted to whites of European origin and were also investigated for latent population substructure
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The study also has limitations.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Despite our large sample size, we had limited power to detect associations with small effect sizes and associations with rare variants.
0	dementia	NA	NA	DISCUSS	While all studies used accepted clinical or pathological criteria to define dementia and AD, phenotypic heterogeneity between samples may have limited our ability to detect some associations.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Moreover, the controls in the Spanish replication sample were younger than the cases and their cognitive status had not been formally examined.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, whereas this could reduce our power to observe an association, it would not invalidate the associations we did observe.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Further, the frequency distribution of minor and major alleles among the Spanish controls was similar to that noted in the discovery sample and in the HapMap CEU sample
0	Alzheimer's disease	CLU	NA	DISCUSS	In conclusion, this meta-analysis of GWAS data from several of the largest AD GWAS studies to date confirms previously known and recently described associations (CLU and PICALM) and shows genome-wide significance and replication for two biologically plausible, novel loci on chromosomes 2 and 19
