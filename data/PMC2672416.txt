0	Type 2 diabetes	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified multiple new genomic loci at which common variants modestly but reproducibly influence risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D).
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Established associations to common and rare variants explain only a small proportion of the heritability of T2D.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	As previously published analyses had limited power to discover loci at which common alleles have modest effects, we performed meta-analysis of three T2D GWA scans encompassing 10,128 individuals of European-descent and ~2.2 million SNPs (directly genotyped and imputed).
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Replication testing was performed in an independent sample with an effective sample size of up to 53,975.
1	NA	JAZF1	NA	ABSTRACT	At least six new loci with robust evidence for association were detected, including the JAZF1 (p=5.0x10-14), CDC123/CAMK1D (p=1.2x10-10), TSPAN8/LGR5 (p=1.1x10-9), THADA (p=1.1x10-9), ADAMTS9 (p=1.2x10-8), and NOTCH2 (p=4.1x10-8) gene regions.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	The large number of loci with relatively small effects indicates the value of large discovery and follow-up samples in identifying additional clues about the inherited basis of T2D
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Genome-wide association studies are unbiased by previous hypotheses concerning candidate genes and pathways, but challenged by the modest effect sizes of individual common susceptibility variants and the need for stringent statistical thresholds.
1	obese	TCF7L2	NA	INTRO	For example, the largest allelic odds ratio of any established common variant for T2D is ~1.35 (TCF7L2), with the nine other validated associations to common variants (excluding FTO, which has its primary effect through obesity) having allelic odds ratios between 1.1 and 1.2.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	To augment power to detect additional loci of similar and/or smaller effect, we increased sample size by combining three previously published GWA studies (Diabetes Genetics Initiative [DGI], Finland-United States Investigation of NIDDM Genetics [FUSION], and Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium [WTCCC]), and extended SNP coverage by imputing untyped SNPs based on patterns of haplotype variation from the HapMap dataset (Table 1)
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We started with a set of genotyped autosomal SNPs that passed quality control (QC) filters in each study: in WTCCC, 393,143 SNPs from the Affymetrix 500k chip (MAF>0.01; 1,924 cases and 2,938 population-based controls from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium); in DGI, 378,860 SNPs from the Affymetrix 500k chip (minor allele frequency [MAF]>0.01; Swedish and Finnish sample of 1,464 T2D cases and 1,467 normoglycaemic controls, including 326 discordant sibships); and in FUSION, 306,222 SNPs from the Illumina 317k chip (MAF>0.01, 1,161 T2D cases and 1,174 normal glucose tolerant controls from Finland) (Supplementary Table 1).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	There were 44,750 SNPs (MAF>0.01) directly genotyped in all three studies across the two platforms.

0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Using these directly measured and imputed genotypes, we tested for association of each SNP with T2D in each study separately, corrected each study for residual population stratification, cryptic relatedness or technical artifacts using genomic control, and then combined these results in a genome-wide meta-analysis across a total of 10,128 samples (4,549 cases, 5,579 controls) (Methods; Supplementary Methods).

0	obese	FTO	NA	INTRO	We also observed evidence for association (p<10-3) at eight of the ten established T2D loci (as well as at the FTO obesity locus) (Supplementary Table 3).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	This is unsurprising, as these same data supported discovery of many of these loci.
1	NA	PPARG	NA	INTRO	Since our goal was to identify new loci, we excluded 1,981 SNPs in the immediate vicinity of these T2D susceptibility loci from further analysis (with the exception of a signal near PPARG, which was followed-up), and examined the remainder of the autosomal genome (Methods; Supplementary Methods).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Even after excluding known loci, we saw a strong enrichment of highly associated variants: 426 with p values <10-4, compared to 217 under the null

0	NA	p<10-5	NA	INTRO	We identified eleven SNPs (ten separate signals, nine of which represent novel loci) with p<0.005 in stage 2, for which the combined stage 1 and stage 2 data (based on direct genotyping of stage 1 samples, where previously imputed) generated p<10-5.

0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The distribution of p values for these 11 SNPs was again inconsistent with a null distribution: all nine new and independent SNPs had effects in the same direction as in the stage 1 + 2 meta-analysis (p=0.002), and seven had p<0.05 in the direction of the original association (p=2.1x10-10) (Table 2)
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Based on the combined stage 1-3 analyses, six signals reach compelling levels of evidence (p=5.0x10-8 or better) for T2D association (Table 2).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	As in all LD-mapping approaches, characterization of the causal variants responsible, their effect sizes, and the genes through which they act will require extensive resequencing and fine-mapping.

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We also assessed our results using random effects meta-analysis to better account for any heterogeneity between the studies (Supplementary Table 6).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Locus-specific and combined sibling relative risk estimates were calculated using sample size-weighted estimates of the effect size and risk-allele frequency derived from stage 2 replication samples only, and under the assumption of allelic and locus independence, as described by
1	NA	NA	L359P	METHODS	Eleven SNPs (rs2641348, rs10490072, rs7578597, rs17036101, rs4607103, rs9472138, rs864745, rs12779790, rs1153188, rs10923931, and rs7961581) were followed up in the stage 3 samples, from the deCODE, KORA, Danish, HUNT, NHS, GEM Consortium (CCC, EPIC, ADDITION/Ely, Norfolk) and METSIM studies (Supplementary Table 1; Supplementary Methods)
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We combined stage 1, 2 and 3 data using both meta-analysis approaches (fixed-effects model to combine ORs and weighted p value-based z-statistic combination across all sample sets) described above (Stage 1 meta-analysis).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We also assessed our results using random effects meta-analysis (Supplementary Table 6).
1	NA	NA	rs7578597	METHODS	We observed some evidence for heterogeneity across studies (the I2 statistic ranged from 0 to 57.8% depending on SNP), with rs7578597 and rs10923931 displaying the largest fold differences in association p value between the fixed- and random-effects model analyses.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Differences in strength of association across studies (leading to evidence for heterogeneity) could reflect interesting biological associations that vary from study to study depending on subject ascertainment scheme
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We have adopted two strategies in reporting the findings from this study.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	In the first, we performed GC-correction of data from DGI, FUSION and WTCCC prior to stage 1 meta-analysis.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We corrected each individual study for the GC inflation observed (directly genotyped and imputed data separately), and combined results across studies.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We present the genome-wide distribution of association statistics in Supplementary Figure 1.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We note that, after study-specific genomic control adjustment, the estimated inflation factor for the stage-1 meta-analysis test statistic was 1.04
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	In the second, we combined GC-uncorrected data from DGI, FUSION and WTCCC for stage 1 meta-analysis and did not correct the meta-analysis test statistics for the overall GC (to guard against over-conservativeness in the estimate of strength of association for interesting signals).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We also present the genome-wide distribution of these statistics in Supplementary Figure 1
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	For the combination of data across stages 1, 2 and 3, we also adopted these two strategies (of using GC-corrected and GC-uncorrected stage 1 data).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	In the first, we performed individual GC-correction of DGI, FUSION and WTCCC stage 1 data prior to meta-analysis with stage 2 and stage 3 data (an approach which may be over-conservative where, as here, none of the T2D-associated SNPs has particular hallmarks of stratification) (Supplementary Note).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	In the second, we combined only uncorrected data (except for the deCODE data, where we have applied GC correction given a more marked genomic control inflation [GC ~1.3] in that sample).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We present the resulting data from both approaches (of using GC-corrected and GC-uncorrected stage 1 data for stage 1-3 meta-analysis) in Supplementary Table 6 and a comparison of results (showing very small differences) in the Supplementary Note.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	All data presented elsewhere in the manuscript reflect the GC-corrected analysis strategy outcome
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	For each SNP in Table 2, we assessed the additive SNP association in the stage 1 and 2 samples before and after including body mass index in the logistic regression model.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	For each genotyped and imputed SNP surrounding a specific T2D signal we assessed the additive SNP association in the stage 1 sample before and after including the Table 2 SNP from the same region in the model.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We analyzed the data and adjusted for covariates for the stage 1 and stage 2 analysis of each sample.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Data were combined across studies as described above.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The ORs and CIs were calculated using a fixed-effects model and p values were calculated using the weighted z-score method.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	For the UK stage 1 samples, we did not have BMI information available for ~1,500 of the population-based controls.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We therefore carried out the conditional BMI analyses by using all T2D cases and only those controls for whom BMI data were available
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Quantitative trait analyses were carried out in the UK, DGI and FUSION samples for the 11 SNPs taken forward to stage 3.
0	NA	insulin	NA	METHODS	We tested BMI, quantitative glycemic traits (fasting and 2 hour glucose and insulin, HOMA-IR), lipid traits (total, HDL and LDL cholesterol, and serum triglycerides) and blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), where available, for association using an additive genetic model (Supplementary Methods)

1	NA	JAZF1	NA	FIG	For each of the (A) JAZF1, (B) CDC123/CAMK1D, (C) TSPAN8/LGR5, (D) THADA, (E) ADAMTS9 and (F) NOTCH2/ADAM30 regions, genotyped and imputed SNPs passing QC across all three stage 1 studies are plotted with their meta-analysis p values (as -log10 values) as a function of genomic position (with NCBI Build 35).
0	NA	NA	NA	FIG	In each panel, the SNP taken forward to stages 2 and 3 is represented by a blue diamond (meta-analysis p value across stages 1-3), and its initial p value in stage 1 data is denoted by a red diamond.
0	NA	NA	NA	FIG	Estimated recombination rates (taken from HapMap) are plotted to reflect the local LD structure around the associated SNPs and their correlated proxies (according to a white to red scale from r2=0 to r2=1; based on pairwise r2 values from HapMap CEU).
