0	lung cancer	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	To explore the impact of common variation on the risk of developing lung cancer we conducted a two-phase genome-wide association (GWA) study.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	In Phase 1, we compared the genotypes of 511,919 tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNPs) in 1,952 cases and 1,438 controls; in Phase 2, 30,568 SNPs were genotyped in 2,465 cases and 3,005 controls.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	SNP selection was based on best supported P-values from Phase 1 and two other GWA studies of lung cancer.
1	NA	NA	rs12914385	ABSTRACT	In the combined analysis of Phases 1 and 2, the strongest associations identified were defined by SNPs mapping to 15q25.1 (rs12914385; P = 3.19 x 10-16), 5p15.33 (rs4975616; P = 6.66 x 10-7), and 6p21.33 (rs3117582; P = 9.13 x 10-7).
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Variation at 15q25.1, but not 5p15.33 or 6p21.33, was strongly associated with smoking behaviour with risk alleles correlated to higher consumption.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Variation at 5p15.33 was shown to significantly influence induction of lung cancer histology.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Pooling data from the four series provided 21,620 genotypes for 7,560 cases and 8,205 controls.
1	lung cancer	NA	rs8034191	ABSTRACT	A meta-analysis provided increased support that variation at 15q25.1 (rs8034191; P = 3.24 x 10-26), 5p15.33 (rs4975616; P = 2.99 x 10-9), and 6p21.33 (rs3117582; P = 4.46 x 10-10) influences lung cancer risk.
0	NA	NA	rs748404	ABSTRACT	The next best-supported associations were attained at 15q15.2 (rs748404: P = 1.08 x 10-6) and 10q23.31 (rs1926203; P = 1.28 x 10-6).
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	These data indicate few common variants account for 1% of the excess familial risk underscoring the necessity of having additional large sample series for gene discovery
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	While >80% of the population attributable risk of lung cancer can be ascribed to tobacco smoking, several lines of evidence indicate that inherited genetic factors influence the development and progression of lung cancer; in particular epidemiological studies have consistently shown an elevated risk of lung cancer in relatives of lung cancer cases after adjustment for smoking
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Recently genome-wide association (GWA) studies of lung cancer have shown common variation at 15q24-25.1 as a determinant of risk.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Two studies found that the same alleles at this locus increased risk of lung cancer and influenced tobacco smoking behaviour.
0	NA	CHRNA3	NA	INTRO	Genes mapping to this region of association include CHRNA3, CHRNA4, CHRNA5, PSM4, LOC123688, and IREB2.
0	NA	CHRNA	NA	INTRO	The CHRNA genes encode the nicotinic receptor subunits; in addition to playing a role in development of nicotine dependence, nicotine receptors also influence cell proliferation and apoptosis.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Hence these genes represent strong candidates for combined lung cancer susceptibility and predilection to smoking.
0	NA	PSMA4	NA	INTRO	PSMA4 encodes the fourth component of the proteasome which plays a role in protein degradation and IREB2 is involved in iron metabolism which may thus impact on oxidative damage.
0	lung cancer	TERT	NA	INTRO	A second lung cancer locus identified through the GWA studies maps to 5p and includes the genes encoding TERT and CLMPTL1.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	In addition to these loci we and others have found statistically significant evidence implicating a third locus at 6p as a risk factor for lung cancer
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	We have previously reported the results of the most extreme hits from Phase 1 of our GWA study with independent replication, identifying 15q25, 5p and 6p as disease loci for lung cancer.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Here, we report comprehensive findings from our GWA study.

0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	To facilitate the identification of additional risk variants we conducted a meta-analysis pooling our UK-GWA Phase 1 and Phase 2 with two other studies: IARC-GWA and Texas-GWA.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Pooling was based on the 21,620 autosomal SNPs genotyped in all three GWA studies which had MAFs >1% and no departure from HWE (P <= 10-5 in cases and controls)

0	lung cancer	Transglutaminase 5	rs504417	RESULTS	Two other SNPs associated with lung cancer risk at P < 10-5 also map to 15q15.2 (rs504417 and rs11853991, 41,341,518bp and 41,344,841bp respectively) and are in strong LD with rs748404 (respective r2 values for: rs748404-rs504417, rs748404-rs504417 are 0.65 and 0.68 based on HapMap CEU, and 0.59 and 0.61 based on UK-GWA Phase 2 controls) rs748404 maps 3' to Transglutaminase 5 (TGM5), with rs504417 and rs11853991 mapping to intron 1 of this gene
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	On the basis of MAFs and associated genotypic risks we estimate the 5p15.33 and 6p21.33 variants individually account for ~1% of the excess familial risk, with the 15q25.1 locus having a much greater impact (~5%).
0	lung cancer	MAF	NA	RESULTS	To gain insight into the basis of the inherited risk of lung cancer in general we estimated the power of our analyses to identify disease-associated loci with different MAF which would account for 1% of the familial risk (Figure 3).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	With the UK-GWA study we had greater than 90% power to harvest variants with similar characteristics to 15q25.1.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	However, we only had ~30% and 40% power to identify variants such as 5p15.33 and 6p21.33 which have much weaker effects.
0	NA	MAF	NA	RESULTS	Using all four datasets our meta-analysis was well powered to identify common variants (MAF >0.15), provided each accounts for >= 1% excess risk.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Clearly for variants such as 5p15.33 power still remained limited
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	These analyses provide increased support that variation at 15q25.1, 5p15.33, and 6p21.33 influences the risk of developing lung cancer.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our estimate of the contribution of 15q25.1, 5p15.33 and 6p21.33 loci to the excess familial risk of lung cancer is likely to be conservative as the effect of the causal variant will typically be larger than the association detected through a tag SNP.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This is especially relevant with respect to the 15q25.1 association as we provide evidence for two independent loci.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Furthermore, since a high proportion of UK-GWA study Phase 2 controls were spouses and unrelated friends of lung cancer cases, over-matching on life-time smoking exposure (i.e., cases and controls may have been more likely to be concordant on smoking status than individuals of the general population) may have impacted on study findings.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Hence risk estimates for smoking-related SNPs identified in our analysis may be attenuated.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In addition multiple causal variants may exist at each locus including low frequency variants with significantly larger effects on risk.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This may impact significantly on the contribution of CHRNA5-A3 region to the familial risk of lung cancer, especially as our analysis provides evidence to support independent alleles at this locus
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Identification of the causal variants for these loci will be challenging, contingent on resequencing and fine mapping studies.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	While in part speculative current data provides information on the probable genetic basis of the associations at 15q25.1, 5p15.33, and 6p21.33.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	While there is strong evidence that a major component (some would assert all) of the lung cancer risk associated with 15q25.1 is mediated through propensity to smoke and hence a higher exposure to smoking-related carcinogens, it does not exclude the possibility 15q25.1 variation also has a direct effect on lung cancer risk as has also been proposed
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Whilst our UK study does not support the tenet of two independent loci at 5p15.33 for lung cancer which has recently been proposed, data from both IARC and Texas provides strong evidence for an independent locus (Supplementary Table 6).
0	lung cancer	NA	rs2736100	DISCUSS	Stratification of UK data by histology does, however provide strong evidence that rs2736100 genotype influences the histology of lung cancer induction favouring development of NSCLC-adenocarcinoma (Table 2).
0	NSCLC	NA	rs2736100	DISCUSS	It is therefore noteworthy in that the Texas GWA study was based on analysis of only NSCLC cases and despite its relatively small size a strong association between rs2736100 and risk was detected.
1	lung cancer	CLPTM1L	NA	DISCUSS	Both CLPTM1L and TERT which map to 5p represent attractive candidates for lung cancer susceptibility a priori assuming the causal variant exerts an influence through a cis effect.
0	lung cancer	TERT	rs401681	DISCUSS	The biology of TERT makes it an attractive candidate for a gene that influences lung cancer risk and moreover association between rs401681 risk allele and shorter telomere length has recently been reported.
1	lung cancer	PAH	NA	DISCUSS	High levels of PAH adducts correlate with lung cancer risk and as a major effect of platinum on cells is through adduct formation, CLPTM1L (alias CRR9) is also an attractive lung cancer susceptibility gene as it encodes a transcript whose over-expression has been linked to cis-platinum resistance
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The 6p21.33 association could be mediated through any number of transcripts mapping to the region of LD.
1	lung cancer	BAT3	NA	DISCUSS	BAT3 represents a strong candidate for lung cancer susceptibility as it is implicated in apoptosis and the protein complexes with E1A-binding protein p300, required for acetylation of p53 in response to DNA damage.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	As the region of LD at 6p21.33 is extensive and contains a large number of transcripts, dissection and elucidation of the causal variant make this the most refractory to interrogation
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Findings from this GWA study provide insight into the allelic architecture of predisposition to lung cancer.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Pooling data from our study with two other GWA studies provided a combined analysis of 7,560 cases and 8,205 controls.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Nevertheless we have failed to identify additional loci to 5p15.33, 6p21.33 and 15q25.1.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	As our power to detect the major common loci conferring risks of 1.2 or greater was high we consider that there are unlikely to be many additional SNPs (tagged by the Illumina 550K array) with similar effects for alleles with frequencies > 0.2 in populations of European ancestry.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Inevitably we had low power to detect alleles with smaller effects and/or MAFs < 0.1.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	By implication, variants with such profiles may represent a much larger class of susceptibility loci for lung cancer and current GWA based strategies based on the currently available commercial arrays are not optimally configured to identify low frequency variants with potentially stronger effects.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Thus there may a large number of low penetrance variants that remain to be discovered.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Further efforts to expand the scale of GWA meta-analyses, in terms of both sample size and SNP coverage, and to increase the number of SNPs taken forward to large-scale replication may thus lead to the identification of additional variants for lung cancer.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Twin studies have not however, provided evidence for heritable factors for the risk of lung cancer.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The identification of disease-causing alleles for lung cancer may thus be inherently harder than for other cancers in which familial aggregation of a major lifestyle/environmental risk factor is less likely to be a confounder
