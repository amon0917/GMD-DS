1	NA	RHOBTB2	rs992531	RESULTS	According to Kaplan-Meier Plotter, one of the two cis-eQTL genes associating with rs992531, RHOBTB2, was associated with survival consistently with the association seen in the eQTL analysis.
0	NA	RHOBTB2	NA	RESULTS	Low expression of the RHOBTB2 gene was associated with poor prognosis among ER positive patients (HR = 1.17; 95% CI 1.05-1.31; P = 0.0038) whereas among ER-negative patients the effect was opposite (HR = 0.87; 95% CI 0.77-0.98; P = 0.02) (Supplementary Figure 8).
1	NA	RHOBTB2	rs1550281	RESULTS	This is consistent with the results of the cis-eQTL analysis: the heterozygote and rare homozygote genotypes of rs1550281 (a tag SNP for rs992531, r2 = 0.414, D' = 1) were associated with decreased RHOBTB2 expression, which in turn was associated with poor survival

1	NA	RAB9P1	NA	RESULTS	In line with the eQTL result, high RAB9P1 expression was associated with better survival (HR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.71-0.91, P = 8.1 x 10-4).
1	NA	RAB9P1	NA	RESULTS	The effect was similar in ER-positive cases, HR = 0.75; 95% CI 0.61-0.92, P = 5.7 x 10-3 and in ER-negative cases, HR = 0.73; 95% CI 0.56-0.97, P = 0.028, indicating that the association between RAB9P1 expression and survival is not specific to the ER-positive subgroup.
1	NA	RAB9P1	NA	RESULTS	Since the cis-eQTL RAB9P1 gene is a pseudogene, and a pseudogene may affect the function of its cognate protein coding gene, we also investigated its parent gene, RAB9A.
0	cancers	RAB9A	NA	RESULTS	In the Kaplan-Meier plotter analysis, high RAB9A expression was associated with poor survival among patients with ER-positive cancers who received endocrine treatment (HR = 2.05 (1.48-2.83), P = 8.6 x 10-6) whereas an opposite effect was seen among ER-negative cases (HR = 0.70 (0.53-0.94), P = 0.015) (Supplementary Figure 9)

0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Rab GTPases have central roles in tumour progression and the development of drug resistance, and are dysregulated in many cancers, including breast cancer.
0	breast cancer	RAB9A	NA	DISCUSS	Rab GTPases, including RAB9A, are also involved in the regulation of autophagy, a biological process known to facilitate the progression of ER-positive breast cancer cells to anti-oestrogen resistance.
0	NA	RAB9A	NA	DISCUSS	In KM-plotter data, high expression of RAB9A was associated with poor survival in the ER-positive subgroup, and the ER-positive endocrine treated subgroup, whereas an opposite effect was seen in the ER-negative subgroup.
1	Neurological and Communication Disorders	RAB9P1	rs7701292	DISCUSS	The biological rationale for the rs7701292 association might thus be that under-expression of RAB9P1, possibly due to impaired HIF-1beta mediated regulation, may upregulate RAB9A expression or activity, leading to anti-oestrogen resistance and consequent poor survival (Figure 1B)
1	NA	RHOBTB2	rs992531	DISCUSS	There appears to be a possible functional link between the rs992531 and rs7701292 loci and their putative target genes RHOBTB2 and RAB9A.
