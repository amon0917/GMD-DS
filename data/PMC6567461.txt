0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in American women.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Early detection and improved treatment modalities have led to a remarkable reduction in the mortality rate of breast cancer patients, and currently more than 3.5 million breast cancer survivors are living in the USA.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Given that approximately 70% of breast cancer patients receive adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) after breast surgery to improve clinical outcomes, it is critical to address cancer survivorship issues relating to RT-induced symptoms which may affect the quality of life (QOL).
0	pain	NA	NA	INTRO	Among many symptoms, pain occurs in up to 60% of breast cancer survivors, where more than half of them report moderate to severe pain.
0	pain	NA	NA	INTRO	Unmanaged pain can interrupt planned RT schedules and impact the accurate delivery of therapeutic radiation doses to tumor tissues, which can thus diminish the potential benefits of adjuvant RT.
0	pain	NA	NA	INTRO	Persistent pain after cancer treatment is also critical, affecting cancer survivor's functional performance and productivity.
0	pain	NA	NA	INTRO	Moreover, once pain develops, it may last for more than 17 years after completion of RT
0	pain	NA	NA	INTRO	In addition to RT planning and treatment parameters, age, body mass index (BMI), medication, lifestyle factors such as smoking and exercise, and coexisting morbidities can contribute to pain perception during RT; however, inter-individual genetic variations can also influence post-RT pain severity.
0	cancers	NA	NA	INTRO	Several studies have reported genetic variants associated with cancer treatment-related pain among breast cancer patients.
0	pain	interleukin (IL)-13	rs1295686	INTRO	For example, genotype AA for interleukin (IL)-13 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1295686 was associated with both pain and lymphedema after breast cancer surgery.
0	breast pain	p<10-5	NA	INTRO	Also, SNPs in cytokine genes IFNG1, IL, and NFKB1 have been associated with severe breast pain following breast cancer surgery.
0	Neurological and Communication Disorders	cytidine deaminase	NA	INTRO	Genetic variations in cytidine deaminase (CDD) contributed to chemotherapy-induced neuropathy.
0	arthralgia	cytochrome P450	NA	INTRO	Furthermore, variations in cytochrome P450 (CYP) and vitamin D receptor (VDR) genes have been associated with aromatase inhibitor-related arthralgia.
0	pain	NA	NA	INTRO	However, there is a scientific knowledge gap regarding the molecular mechanisms or the genetic variants influencing pain in patients receiving adjuvant RT
0	pain	NA	NA	INTRO	Thus, to identify susceptibility loci for post-RT pain, we completed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 1,344,832 SNPs in a prospectively followed cohort of breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant RT for breast cancer.
0	pain	NA	NA	INTRO	As part of this study, we completed gene-based association analyses and functional enrichment pathway analyses to describe the biological profiles underlying genetic mechanisms of post-RT pain.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Gene-based association approach considers the joint actions of multiple SNPs within a gene and assigns a representative p value for a gene.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	If a gene contains more than one causative SNPs with small or moderate effect, then joint effects of several SNPs within that gene may be more detectable than single SNP effect.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Functional enrichment pathway analysis, using the gene list produced by gene-based association analyses, is complementary to GWAS in finding risk loci as well as interpreting GWAS results in terms of biological features or function

0	pain	NA	NA	DISCUSS	According to the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog, a total of eight studies reported 30 SNPs associated with any pain.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Among these eight studies, four studies reported nine SNPs reaching a genome-wide significance (p values <= 5 x 10-8), while the other four studies identified suggestive susceptibility loci with p values <= 5 x 10-6.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In 2013, Kim et al.
0	pain	ZNF429	rs2562456	DISCUSS	reported the first GWAS of pain that identified rs2562456 in ZNF429 gene to be significantly associated with acute post-surgery pain (N = 112; p = 2.0 x 10-10).
0	pain	CCT5	rs13361160	DISCUSS	In 2013, a large study with 7099 Europeans reported another genome-wide significant SNP, rs13361160 in CCT5 gene for widespread pain (p = 1.2 x 10-8).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, this significance was attenuated when it was combined with the replication sample of 9469 Europeans (p = 4.7 x 10-7)
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In 2016, Reyes-Gibby et al.
0	pain	NA	rs3862188	DISCUSS	reported another genome-wide significant SNP, rs3862188 in RP11-634B7.4 gene for severe pre-treatment pain in head and neck cancer patients (N = 1368; p = 3 x 10-8).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Reyes-Gibby et al.
0	neuropathic pain	NA	rs10950641	DISCUSS	identified 2 years later additional four SNPs which had statistically significant associations with neuropathic pain in head and neck cancer patients (N = 1043; rs10950641, p = 3 x 10-14; rs4804217, p = 3 x 10-9; rs6796803, p = 6 x 10-9; rs4775319, p = 1 x 10-8).
0	pain	NA	NA	DISCUSS	These findings suggest that statistical power may increase when GWAS targets specific types of pain such as neuropathic pain.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Another approach to increase statistical power would be a meta-analysis.
0	chronic back pain	NA	rs12310519	DISCUSS	A recent study of meta-analysis of individual data from 15 cohorts (N = 158,000) reported three SNPs significantly associated with chronic back pain (rs12310519, p = 5 x 10-19; rs7833174, p = 4 x 10-13; rs4384683, p = 2 x 10-10).
0	pain	CD3E	NA	DISCUSS	Susceptibility genes identified previously for any type of pain traits included CD3E, HMGB1P46, C5, DDC, DIS3L2, ESRRG, GFRA2, DOK2, GPD2, IL1R1, LCLAT1, MCM3, PRKCA, RORA, SNX8, SOX5, TESC, and ZSCAN20.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	None of these genes reached the pre-defined significance level of p < 2.5 x 10-6 in our study
0	pain	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We identified 13 enriched biological pathways for post-RT pain, which were clustered into two groups by DAVID functional annotation module: glucuronidation and olfactory receptor activities.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Glucuronidation activity is involved in detoxification and xenobiotic metabolism of substances such as drugs, bilirubin, and fatty-acid derivatives.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Glucuronidation transfers glucuronic acid component of uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronic acid to a substrate by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase to make substances more water-soluble, so they can be excreted from body or less toxic.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The ascorbate and aldarate metabolism pathway include glucuronidation in the upstream processes of ascorbate synthesis.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Ascorbate, which is well known as vitamin C, plays a critical role as an antioxidant in many biological processes such as detoxification of exogenous compounds.
0	pain	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Vitamin C has a beneficial effect on pain relief in different pain conditions including cancer pain by decreasing oxidative stress and/or inflammation, which can both be caused by anti-cancer treatments.
0	pain	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Ascorbate also functions as a cofactor for a family of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of neurotransmitters and neuropeptide hormones that can modulate pain transmission
0	pain	OR10V1	NA	DISCUSS	Olfactory receptor activity can be aligned with our findings of OR10V1 as one of the genes associated with post-RT pain.
0	NA	OR52N1	NA	DISCUSS	We also found three additional olfactory receptor genes (OR52N1, OR4C12, OR4A47) included in the top 30 genes.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Recently, Reyes-Gibby et al.
0	pain	NA	NA	DISCUSS	have reported that genetic variants in RP11-634B7.4 gene, which is annotated as antisense to the three olfactory receptor genes, OR13G1, OR6F1, and OR14A2, were significantly associated with severe pre-treatment pain among patients with head and neck cancer at genome-wide significance levels.
0	Inflammation Laboratory's JDRF	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The olfactory receptors are members of G-protein-coupled receptors, which are involved in signal transduction and play important roles in many physiological processes including sensory perception, regulation of behavior and mood, regulation of immune system activity and inflammation, and tumor growth and metastasis.
0	pain	MAPK1	NA	DISCUSS	The authors speculated that olfactory receptor genes may be involved in pain pathway via activating downstream mitogen-activated kinases (MAPK) signaling pathway, by linking to their previous finding of MAPK1/ERK2 as a novel target gene for cancer pain.
0	cancer pain	MAPK1	NA	DISCUSS	In fact, there have been many animal experiments to modulate neuropathic cancer pain by inhibiting MAPK signaling pathway using upstream effectors, such as R419, adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase activator, and bisphosphonates.
0	cancer pain	MAPK1	NA	DISCUSS	Considering that majority of breast cancer pain is neuropathic in nature, the investigation of a functional mechanism which connects olfactory receptors, MAPK pathway, and pain perception in breast cancer patients may seem worthwhile.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	More studies in larger populations are needed to validate our findings
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This study has several strengths and limitations.
0	pain	NA	NA	DISCUSS	To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of GWAS of post-RT pain among breast cancer patients of different race and ethnicity.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Considering that majority of GWAS data currently available are for NHW, the results from diverse race/ethnic background have more potential for generalizability.
0	pain	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Second, the ascertainment of outcome variables was relatively homogeneous compared to large consortium-based studies because we obtained self-reported pain severity data using the same questionnaires from all participating centers.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The first limitation of this study is the relatively small sample size, which might have limited the statistical power of the analysis.
1	NA	NA	rs16970540	DISCUSS	Based on our findings of rs16970540, with minor allele frequency of 0.1, OR of 2.2, and type 1 error rate of 5 x 10-8, we had only 17% statistical power to be able to reject the null hypothesis.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We will need 694 cases and 1673 controls to have at least 80% of statistical power.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	So, a larger joint GWAS with multiple cohorts is warranted to validate our findings.
0	pain	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In addition to limited statistical power, the failure of GWAS may be attributed to the complex nature of the phenotype, post-RT pain, we evaluated.
0	pain	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Pain is a more complex functional end-point, which is affected by multiple genes within a pathway rather than a simple Mendelian disease.
0	pain	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We employed gene-based association analyses and pathway-based analyses to increase statistical power as well as to find additional genetic loci underlying molecular mechanisms of post-RT pain.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Another limitation would be the lack of replication with an independent dataset
0	pain	NA	NA	CONCL	In the current study, we conducted GWAS, gene-based association analyses, and pathway-based functional enrichment analyses to evaluate the genetic risk loci for acute post-RT pain among breast cancer patients.
1	pain	LIG3	NA	CONCL	We identified two biological processes, glucuronidation activity and olfactory receptor activity, in addition to the potential role of LIG3, ABCC4/MPR4, and EGFL6 from GWAS, were involved in post-RT pain, which showed that post-RT pain is a polygenic trait.
0	pain	NA	NA	CONCL	Post-RT pain can be affected by DNA damage/repair, transporter and receptor activity in signal transduction, and cellular detoxification via glucuronidation activity.
0	pain	NA	NA	CONCL	Larger studies are warranted to validate our findings to facilitate the discovery of underlying genetic/molecular mechanisms of pain related to cancer treatments.
0	cancer pain	NA	NA	CONCL	The results can ultimately contribute to the development of prevention and/or intervention strategies to improve cancer pain management and QOL in cancer patients
