0	Type 2 diabetes	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Substantial progress has been made in identification of type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk loci in the past few years, but our understanding of the genetic basis of T2D in ethnically diverse populations remains limited.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	We performed a genome-wide association study and a replication study in Chinese Hans comprising 8,569 T2D case subjects and 8,923 control subjects in total, from which 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms were selected for further follow-up in a de novo replication sample of 3,410 T2D case and 3,412 control subjects and an in silico replication sample of 6,952 T2D case and 11,865 control subjects.
1	NA	CDKAL1	rs10886471	ABSTRACT	Besides confirming seven established T2D loci (CDKAL1, CDKN2A/B, KCNQ1, CDC123, GLIS3, HNF1B, and DUSP9) at genome-wide significance, we identified two novel T2D loci, including G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 5 (GRK5) (rs10886471: P = 7.1 x 10-9) and RASGRP1 (rs7403531: P = 3.9 x 10-9), of which the association signal at GRK5 seems to be specific to East Asians.
1	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	In nondiabetic individuals, the T2D risk-increasing allele of RASGRP1-rs7403531 was also associated with higher HbA1c and lower homeostasis model assessment of beta-cell function (P = 0.03 and 0.0209, respectively), whereas the T2D risk-increasing allele of GRK5-rs10886471 was also associated with higher fasting insulin (P = 0.0169) but not with fasting glucose.

0	Type 2 diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	The prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) has increased dramatically in China during the past few decades, and currently >92 million Chinese adults are estimated to have T2D.
0	obese	NA	NA	INTRO	Although nutritional transition, lifestyle changes, and increasing obesity prevalence are important risk factors driving the epidemic in China, genetic factors also play a major role in T2D susceptibility.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified >50 T2D susceptibility loci, predominantly in populations of European ancestry, but also in East and South Asians.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Risk variants at these loci are generally of modest effect and altogether explain only 10-15% of the heritability of T2D.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	East Asians, including Chinese, have been shown to be genetically more susceptible to developing T2D than Western populations, but the genetic mechanism underlying this ethnic difference remains poorly understood.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Although at least 14 T2D loci have been identified through GWAS in East Asian populations, these loci are not sufficient to explain the ethnic difference in T2D susceptibility.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Moreover, some of these loci remain to be validated in additional independent cohorts.

0	NA	G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 5	NA	FIG	Values of the GRK5 relative expression levels were natural log transformed before analysis
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We compared the LD structure of the two novel T2D loci between Chinese Hans and Europeans and Japanese (Supplementary Figs.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	6 and 7A), respectively.
1	NA	G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 5	NA	RESULTS	Different pairwise LD patterns were observed between Chinese Hans and Europeans at both GRK5 (P = 0.0432) and RASGRP1 (P = 0.0043) loci, but not between Chinese Hans and Japanese (P >= 0.101) (Supplementary Table 14).
1	NA	NA	rs10886471	RESULTS	The risk allele frequencies of both GRK5-rs10886471 and RASGRP1-rs7403531 in East Asians (0.79 and 0.33 in the HapMap CHB population and 0.74 and 0.45 in the HapMap JPT population for rs10886471 and rs7403531, respectively) were also higher than those in Europeans (0.48 and 0.28 for rs10886471 and rs7403531 in HapMap CEU population, respectively) (Supplementary Table 13)
1	NA	G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 5	rs10886471	DISCUSS	In this study, we not only confirmed more than 20 previously reported loci, but also identified two novel T2D loci: GRK5 (rs10886471) and RASGRP1 (rs7403531).
1	NA	G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 5	rs10886471	DISCUSS	The SNP rs10886471 maps to an LD block within intron 3 of the GRK5 gene, the only gene in this LD block (Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	6).
1	NA	G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 5	rs10886471	DISCUSS	Regional plots showed that rs10886471 represents the strongest association signals at the GRK5 locus (Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	3A and Supplementary Fig.

0	Inflammation Laboratory's JDRF	G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 5	NA	DISCUSS	GRK5 belongs to the GPCR kinase family and plays a crucial role in phosphorylation of multiple GPCRs and non-GPCR substrates, such as glucagon receptor, beta2-adrenergic receptor, Hsp70-interacting protein, and nuclear factor-kappaB1/p105, which are either key regulators of glucose homeostasis or inflammation.
0	NA	G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 5	NA	DISCUSS	Disruption of GRK5 leads to decreased production of multiple inflammatory cytokines/chemokines and decreased nuclear factor-kappaB activation both in vivo and in vitro.
1	NA	G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 5	rs10886471	DISCUSS	The T2D risk-increasing allele of rs10886471 was also associated with higher GRK5 mRNA expression levels, higher fasting insulin, but not with fasting glucose, suggesting that it might impair insulin sensitivity by increasing inflammatory response and consequently contributes to T2D risk in Chinese Hans or East Asians.
1	NA	G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 5	NA	DISCUSS	Notably, GRK5 is a population-specific T2D locus and the T2D association of GRK5-rs10886471 was not replicated in populations of European origin.
1	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The risk allele frequency of GRK5-rs10886471 in Chinese Hans was also much higher than in Europeans (0.79 and 0.48 in HapMap CHB and CEU populations, respectively), and the corresponding population attributable risk in Chinese Hans was estimated to be 8.66%.
0	NA	G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 5	NA	DISCUSS	Moreover, there are significant different LD structure for GRK5 (P = 0.0432) locus between Chinese Hans and Europeans
1	NA	RASGRP1	rs7403531	DISCUSS	The second novel association signal (rs7403531) is located at chr15q14 and in intron 2 of the RASGRP1 gene (Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	7A), which has also been replicated in Europeans from the DIAGRAM Consortium (Supplementary Tables 8 and 13).
0	NA	NA	rs7403531	DISCUSS	Although no heterogeneity of effect was observed between Chinese Hans and Europeans, the risk allele frequency of rs7403531 in Chinese Hans was moderately higher than in Europeans (0.33 and 0.28 in HapMap CHB and CEU populations, respectively).
0	NA	NA	rs12593201	DISCUSS	Regional plots showed that the strongest association signal at this locus was observed with an imputed SNP rs12593201 (r2 = 0.81 with rs7403531) (Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	3B and Supplementary Fig.
0	DIAGRAM plus GWAS	NA	NA	DISCUSS	5), which also showed a stronger T2D association in the DIAGRAM plus GWAS meta-analysis (P = 2.4 x 10-3) (Supplementary Table 13).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Conditional analysis in stage 1 samples suggested that neither of the SNPs were likely to be the SNP driving the association (P >= 0.11).
0	insulin-treated diabetes	NA	rs7403531	DISCUSS	Notably, rs7403531 was in modest LD (r2 = 0.46 in HapMap CEU population) with a variant (rs7171171) previously shown to be associated with type 1 diabetes (T1D) in populations of European ancestry, but they are not in LD in Chinese Hans (r2 = 0.03 in HapMap CHB population) (Supplementary Fig.
1	NA	RASGRP1	NA	DISCUSS	7B), suggesting that the T2D association at RASGRP1 is unlikely to be driven by the T1D-associated SNP.
1	NA	RASGRP1	NA	DISCUSS	RASGRP1 encodes the RAS guanyl releasing protein 1 (RasGRP1) that functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, which is required for the activation of Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways and critically mediates the development and function of both T and B lymphocytes.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	RasGRP1-deficient mice exhibit defects in lymphocyte proliferation, inflammatory cytokine production, and apoptosis.
1	NA	RASGRP1	NA	DISCUSS	RASGRP1 is highly expressed in lymphocytes but also in various other cells, including pancreatic beta-cells.
0	Inflammation Laboratory's JDRF	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Its dysfunction in beta-cells may lead to islet inflammation and impaired beta-cell function, which are considered as major factors involved in T2D pathogenesis.
1	NA	NA	rs7403531	DISCUSS	In accordance with this, the T2D risk-increasing allele of RASGRP1-rs7403531 was also associated higher plasma glucose and lower HOMA-B, suggesting that the T2D risk conferred by rs7403531 is likely mediated through an impaired beta-cell function.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, more functional studies are required to draw a firm conclusion
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	To test possible misclassification of T1D in our study, we also examined associations of all known T1D-associated variants with T2D in our stage 1 samples.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In contrast to the multiple replicated T2D loci, very few of the T1D-associated variants showed a trend toward association with T2D (P values: 0.01-0.05, P for binomial test = 0.24) (Supplementary Table 15), suggesting a low misclassification rate in our stage 1 sample.
1	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Moreover, we observed a similar OR (combined P = 1 x 10-3; OR = 1.09) when we performed secondary association analyses for RASGRP1-rs7403531 in 5,678 T2D case and 8,438 control subjects from several hospital-based case-control studies, in which all T2D case subjects were negative for glutamic acid decarboxylase and insulin autoantibody tests.
1	NA	RASGRP1	NA	DISCUSS	All of these results, together with the facts that all genotyped T2D case subjects in our study were >30 years of age and had no prior history of T1D, suggested that the observed T2D association signals at RASGRP1 and GRK5 were unlikely to be driven by T1D-associated variants or by case misclassification in our study
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Taken together, this study is the largest GWAS of T2D performed in Chinese Hans thus far.
1	NA	G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 5	NA	DISCUSS	We have identified two novel loci (GRK5 and RASGRP1) that are associated with T2D at genome-wide significant levels.
0	NA	G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 5	NA	DISCUSS	In particular, the association signal at GRK5 seems to be specific to East Asians, but this finding needs to be confirmed in further studies.
1	NA	KCNQ1	NA	DISCUSS	We have also confirmed the known T2D loci at KCNQ1, CDKAL1, CDKN2B, CDC123, HNF1B, GLIS3, and DUSP9 at genome-wide significant levels.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our findings not only provide new insights into the pathophysiology of T2D, but may also shed light on the ethnic differences in T2D susceptibility
