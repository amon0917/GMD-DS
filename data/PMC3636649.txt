0	diabetes	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and a multistage meta-analysis of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Punjabi Sikhs from India.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Our discovery GWAS in 1,616 individuals (842 case subjects) was followed by in silico replication of the top 513 independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (P < 10-3) in Punjabi Sikhs (n = 2,819; 801 case subjects).
0	NA	p<10-4	NA	ABSTRACT	We further replicated 66 SNPs (P < 10-4) through genotyping in a Punjabi Sikh sample (n = 2,894; 1,711 case subjects).
1	NA	SGCG	rs9552911	ABSTRACT	On combined meta-analysis in Sikh populations (n = 7,329; 3,354 case subjects), we identified a novel locus in association with T2D at 13q12 represented by a directly genotyped intronic SNP (rs9552911, P = 1.82 x 10-8) in the SGCG gene.
0	NA	p<10-4	NA	ABSTRACT	Next, we undertook in silico replication (stage 2b) of the top 513 signals (P < 10-3) in 29,157 non-Sikh South Asians (10,971 case subjects) and de novo genotyping of up to 31 top signals (P < 10-4) in 10,817 South Asians (5,157 case subjects) (stage 3b).
1	NA	p<10-5	NA	ABSTRACT	In combined South Asian meta-analysis, we observed six suggestive associations (P < 10-5 to < 10-7), including SNPs at HMG1L1/CTCFL, PLXNA4, SCAP, and chr5p11.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Further evaluation of 31 top SNPs in 33,707 East Asians (16,746 case subjects) (stage 3c) and 47,117 Europeans (8,130 case subjects) (stage 3d), and joint meta-analysis of 128,127 individuals (44,358 case subjects) from 27 multiethnic studies, did not reveal any additional loci nor was there any evidence of replication for the new variant.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Our findings provide new evidence on the presence of a population-specific signal in relation to T2D, which may provide additional insights into T2D pathogenesis
0	Type 2 diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	South Asians (people originating from the Indian subcontinent) comprise more than a quarter of the global population and contribute the highest number of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	According to latest estimates, ~61 million people in India alone are currently afflicted with T2D, and their number is projected to increase to ~101 million by 2030.
0	coronary artery disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Consequently, ~60% of the world's coronary artery disease (CAD), a principal cause of mortality in individuals with T2D, is expected to occur in India.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	There is considerable ethnic difference in the prevalence and progression of T2D and CAD.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In addition to environmental factors, genetic factors influence disease susceptibility.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The incidence of T2D and CAD is about three to five times higher in immigrant South Asians compared with Euro-Caucasians, and the age of onset of T2D is roughly a decade earlier in South Asians than in Europeans.
0	multifactorial disease	NA	NA	INTRO	The higher prevalence of T2D among South Asians settled in developed countries compared with the host population reflects the genetic and ethnic predisposition to cardiometabolic disease under an adverse environment and the joint effects of genes and environment in the predisposition to T2D.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	For these reasons, we conducted ethnic-specific genetic studies in a Sikh population to dissect genetic pathways that may contribute to T2D etiology in different ethnic groups
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The vast majority of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on T2D so far have been performed on Europeans.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Studies on non-European populations, especially those with unique demographic and cultural histories, are important for identifying population-specific linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns and environmental factors that may modulate disease risk or protection.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Interestingly, many, but not all, of the common loci originally identified in Europeans have been replicated in non-European groups.
0	NA	GRB14	NA	INTRO	Recent GWAS in non-European populations have yielded intriguing new variants, including six novel signals in South Asians represented by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near GRB14, ST6GAL1, VPS26A, HMG20A, AP3S2, and HNF4A in our recent meta-analysis of GWAS.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Given the existence of marked genetic variability among South Asian communities, in addition to diversity in culture, language, caste system, physical appearance, and diet, they do not constitute a single homogeneous community.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Therefore, screening populations with a different genetic and racial background or environmental exposures may improve insights about the disease and genetic risk factors
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	People from India have a complex racial history complicated by the presence of a caste system that has prohibited interbreeding to a great extent and consequently separated people into numerous endogamous groups.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The Sikhs, a relatively young, inbred population of ~26 million (2% of the Indian population), are from the northwestern province of India and follow a distinct and unique religion born ~500 years ago in Punjab.
0	obese	NA	NA	INTRO	"They have an interesting background for ""nontraditional"" disease enrichment in the absence of conventional risk factors such as smoking, obesity, and a diet rich in meats."
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Sikhs do not smoke or chew tobacco because of religious and cultural compulsions, and ~50% of them are lifelong vegetarians.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Despite the absence of these lifestyle-related risk factors, T2D and CAD have reached epidemic proportions in Sikhs.
0	diabetes	FTO	NA	INTRO	Our initial genetic studies in a Sikh cohort as part of the Asian Indian Diabetic Heart Study (AIDHS) or the Sikh Diabetes Study (SDS) revealed an association of FTO and MTNR1B, ADIPOQ, and PPARG polymorphisms with T2D and risk factors in the absence of obesity.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In this investigation, we conducted a GWAS in a relatively homogenous Punjabi Sikh population of 1,850 individuals and performed multistage replication in up to 27 case-control studies of Punjabi, other South Asian, East Asian, and Caucasian ancestries (total n = 128,127; 44,358 T2D case and 83,769 control subjects) (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Study design of the discovery, replication, and meta-analysis phases was optimized to detect new population-specific and multiethnic T2D loci (Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	1).
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	One important difference in the current study from our previous South Asian GWAS is that in the previous study, the SNPs that were common between South Asians and Europeans were selected for replication based on the European Diabetes Genetics Replication and Meta-analysis (DIAGRAM) sample.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	However, in this study, the SNP selection was prioritized based on the top signals (P < 10-3) from our discovery Sikh cohort
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Our primary Sikh GWAS (discovery) cohort used in this investigation is comprised of 1,616 individuals from the Punjabi Sikh population that was a part of the AIDHS (also named the SDS).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The AIDHS/SDS has unique characteristics that are ideal for genetic studies.
0	long QT syndrome	NA	NA	METHODS	Sikhs are strictly a nonsmoking population, and ~50% of participants are teetotalers and life-long vegetarians.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	All individuals for the GWAS discovery cohort were recruited from one geographical location.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	METHODS	Diagnosis of T2D was confirmed by scrutinizing medical records for symptoms and use of medication and measuring fasting glucose levels according to the guidelines of the American Diabetes Association, as described previously.
0	NA	insulin	NA	METHODS	Data on lipids, insulin, glucose, anthropometric measurements, education, socioeconomic status, job grade, diet, and physical activity were available on >95% of the AIDHS/SDS individuals selected for this study.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Dietary questions involving alcohol consumption were scored using a scale from 0 to 5; details are described elsewhere.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	T2D is often asymptomatic and remains undiagnosed for many years, especially in people from the developing world due to poor healthcare provisions.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the actual age of onset of T2D in Sikhs may range from 39 to 42 years of age compared with the observed age at diagnosis (46 years).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	This age is in sharp contrast to the mean age at onset of 60 years or above in developed countries.

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Impaired glucose tolerance is defined as a 2-h OGTT >7.8 mmol/L (>140 mg/dL) but <11.1 mmol/L (<200 mg/dL).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The 2-h OGTTs were performed according to the criteria of the World Health Organization (75-g oral load of glucose).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	BMI was calculated as weight (kg)/height (m)2, and waist-to-hip ratio was calculated as the ratio of abdomen or waist circumference to hip circumference.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	METHODS	Subjects with type 1 diabetes, or those with a family member with type 1 diabetes, or rare forms of T2D subtypes (maturity-onset diabetes of the young) or secondary diabetes (from, e.g., hemochromatosis or pancreatitis) were excluded from the study.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The selection of control subjects was based on a fasting glucose <100.8 mg/dL or a 2-h glucose <141.0 mg/dL.
0	glucose homeostasis	NA	NA	METHODS	Subjects with impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance were excluded when data were analyzed for association of the variants with T2D.

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Age, sex, BMI, and 5 or 10 principal components to adjust for residual population stratification were included as covariates.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	As the existing HapMap2 or HapMap3 and 1000 Genomes data do not include Sikhs, the 5 or 10 principal components used for this correction were estimated using our Sikh population sample and not the HapMap populations.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	After association analyses, the genomic control inflation factor (lambda) was 1.0, so no adjustments were made (Supplementary Fig.

1	NA	TCF7L2	rs7903146	RESULTS	Upon meta-analysis of 31 loci in Asians (South Asians and AGEN+), genome-wide associations were only seen in TCF7L2 (rs7903146, P = 1.93 x 10-38) and IGF2BP2 (rs1470579, P = 1.54 x 10-13) (Supplementary Table 9).
1	NA	TCF7L2	rs7903146	RESULTS	In joint multiethnic meta-analysis on 128,127 individuals from 27 studies, only two previously known loci, TCF7L2 (rs7903146, P = 8.53 x 10-75) and IGF2BP2 (rs1470579, P = 1.81 x 10-19), showed robust associations.
1	NA	SGCG	rs9552911	RESULTS	Interestingly, none of the Punjabi hits could be independently confirmed in AGEN+ or DIAGRAM+ (notably, the lead rs9552911 variant from SGCG was monomorphic in DIAGRAM+) (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 10).
1	NA	SGCG	NA	RESULTS	Lookup of 50 kb upstream and downstream of SNPs within the SGCG locus in the publicly available data of the Meta-Analyses of Glucose and Insulin-Related Traits Consortium (MAGIC) study on glycemic trait GWAS revealed several nominal associations of SNPs with fasting blood glucose and 2-h glucose levels (Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	3).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Some of these SNPs also showed an association with fasting blood glucose and waist or waist-to-hip ratio in Sikhs (Supplementary Table 11), but none of these were in LD (r2 >0.20) with our lead SNP
1	NA	SGCG	NA	RESULTS	We examined the expression of SGCG and neighboring genes (FLJ46358, MIPEP, SACS, and sTNFRSF19) within 1 Mb of the index SNP by cis expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis using adipose tissue, skin, and lymphoblastic cell line gene expression data from the MuTHER Consortium, comprising healthy female twins of European ancestry from Britain.
1	NA	SGCG	NA	RESULTS	Several SNPs in the SGCG region were associated with significantly elevated (PeQTL < 10-4 to < 10-9) expression of SGCG mRNA in adipose tissues (Supplementary Table 12 and Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	4).
1	NA	SGCG	rs572303	RESULTS	One adipose eQTL from MuTHER (rs572303, PeQTL = 5.47 x 10-4) located within SGCG showed a nominally significant association with increased waist circumference in Sikhs (beta = 0.67, P = 5.2 x 10-2) (Supplementary Table 11).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	As shown in Supplementary Fig.
1	NA	SGCG	rs9552911	RESULTS	4, the LD patterns in the region (~1.46 Mb) surrounding the SGCG variant (rs9552911) varied in East Asians (JPT), Africans (YRI), Caucasians (CEU), Gujarati Indians (GIH), and Sikhs.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Interestingly, in Caucasians and Yorubians, this variant was monomorphic.
0	NA	NA	rs9552911	RESULTS	However, several alternative SNPs from this region in Europeans were nominally associated with fasting blood glucose (MAGIC study, r2 ranging from 0.10 to 0.20 with the index SNP [rs9552911]) and mRNA expression of adipose cells in the MuTHER study (r2 ranging from 0.14 to 0.26 with the index SNP).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	These data suggest that population differences may underlie the weak LD.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	It is possible that a single causal variant may be responsible for these associations, but LD may differ between Sikhs, Europeans, and other populations
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We further looked to compare the distributions of inbreeding coefficients and autozygosity as described by Nalls et al.. As expected, the inbreeding coefficients in our sample were higher compared with two outbred populations of European Americans, Coriell, and Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) (F = 0.041 +- 0.018 in Sikhs vs. F = 0.007 +- 0.019 in Coriell and F = -0.3 +- 0.012 in BLSA), as assessed by Nalls et al..
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	However, these results were similar to other Indian populations previously reported by Reich et al.. No significant difference in inbreeding was observed between case and control subjects (P = 0.59).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Autozygosity analysis determined that there were 19 +- 7 homozygous segments >1 Mb in length, with an average length of 2.0 +- 0.95 Mb.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Hence, fewer but longer autozygous segments were found in our population than in outbred populations.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	No correlation of measures of autozygosity to age was observed (P > 0.05) across decades of age
1	NA	SGCG	rs9552911	DISCUSS	In this GWAS and multistage meta-analysis, a novel locus at 13q12 in the SGCG gene (rs9552911, P = 1.82 x 10-8) was identified as associated with T2D susceptibility in Punjabi Sikhs from Northern India
1	autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy	SGCG	NA	DISCUSS	SGCG is a member of the sarcoglycan complex of transmembrane glycoproteins mutated in autosomal recessive muscular dystrophy, in particular limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2C (LGMD2C).
1	breast cancer	SGCG	NA	DISCUSS	SGCG is expressed in skeletal muscle, and its high expression is also seen in vascular smooth muscle cells as well as in breast cancer cell lines.
1	Alzheimer's disease	SGCG	NA	DISCUSS	Founder mutations in SGCG that cause LGMD2C predate migration of the Romani gypsies of Europe out of India around 1100 AD.
1	NA	SGCG	NA	DISCUSS	Due to complete endogamy, this genetically isolated community had an increased incidence of autosomal recessive LGMD2C.
0	dystrophic cardiomyopathy	NA	NA	DISCUSS	SGCG-targeted knockout mice displayed a variety of phenotypes, including dystrophic cardiomyopathy and defects in skeletal muscle, metabolism, homeostasis, growth, apoptosis, aging, and behavior.
0	glucose homeostasis	SGCG	NA	DISCUSS	Mice lacking the sarcoglycan complex including SGCG in adipose and skeletal muscle were shown to be glucose intolerant and exhibited whole-body insulin resistance due to impaired insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle
0	NA	NA	rs9552911	DISCUSS	"The allelic distribution of the less common ""A"" (protective) allele of rs9552911 ranged from 0.06 to 0.15 in South Asians and differed between other South Asians (0.11) and Punjabi Sikhs (0.08) (see details in Supplementary Table 13)."
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Further replication in large independent datasets of South Asians and Punjabi Sikhs would be needed to confirm the pattern of observed association.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In view of the complex racial history complicated by a well-defined caste system, Indian populations display a great deal of genetic and cultural diversity.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Studies suggest that genetic affinity among endogamous communities in India is inversely correlated with geographic distance between them.
0	NA	NA	rs9552911	DISCUSS	Therefore, it is possible that undetected causal variant(s) or multiple rare variants in LD with this marker arose on a haplotype tagged by rs9552911 in Punjabi Sikhs after divergence from other South and West Indian populations.
0	NA	NA	rs9552911	DISCUSS	This variation in the index SNP rs9552911 does not appear to be of recent origin, as suggested by comparative genomic analysis (Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	5).
1	NA	PPARG	NA	DISCUSS	Two important nuclear hormone receptors and transcription factors (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma [PPAR-gamma] [1 and 2] and PPAR-alpha) bind to the promoter and intron 1 of the SGCG gene.
1	diabetes	insulin	NA	DISCUSS	Further, the maturity-onset diabetes of young 4 (MODY4) locus at chromosome 13q12, represented by insulin promoter factor 1 or PDX-1, lies next to the SGCG locus.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Therefore, further in-depth examination by targeted resequencing in the extended region and functional studies may reveal putative causative variants in this extended region and provide insight into the physiological relevance of the observed association
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In summary, our study identified a novel locus associated with T2D in a population of Punjabi Sikh ancestry from Northern India.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	These findings not only provide new information on previously unknown regions associated with T2D but demonstrate a putative population-specific association that could lead to additional biological insights into T2D pathogenesis
