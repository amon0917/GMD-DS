0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) primary genome-wide association (GWA) scan on seven diseases, including the multifactorial, autoimmune disease, type 1 diabetes (T1D), shows significant association (P < 5 x 10-7 between T1D and six chromosome regions: 12q24, 12q13, 16p13, 18p11, 12p13 and 4q27.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Here, we attempted to validate these and six other top findings in 4,000 individuals with T1D, 5,000 controls and 2,997 family trios that were independent of the WTCCC study.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	We confirmed unequivocally the associations of 12q24, 12q13, 16p13 and 18p11 (Pfollow-up <= 1.35 x 10-9; Poverall <= 1.15 x 10-14), leaving eight regions with small effects or false-positive associations with T1D.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	We also obtained evidence for chromosome 18q22 (Poverall = 1.38 x 10-8) from a genome-wide association study of nonsynonymous SNPs.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Several regions, including 18q22 and 18p11, showed association with autoimmune thyroid disease.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	This study increases the number of T1D loci with compelling evidence from six to at least ten
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	There is convincing evidence for association of six loci with T1D: the first, discovered over 25 years ago and having by far the largest effect, are the HLA class II genes on chromosome 6p21 in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC).
1	NA	insulin	NA	INTRO	Other loci include the gene encoding insulin (INS) on 11p15, CTLA4 on 2q33, PTPN22 on 1p13, the interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain (IL2RA, also known as CD25) region on 10p15 and, most recently, the IFIH1 (also known as MDA5) region on 2q24 (ref., ref.).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	These genes explain only some of the familial clustering of T1D (Supplementary Table 1 online).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We have assumed for T1D the classical model of a small number of genes with large effects and a large number of genes with small effects.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	If this genetic model is correct, notwithstanding a major role for (unknown) environmental factors, there should be many more new genes (and pathways) to be discovered, provided sample sizes, study design and genotyping technology suffice
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Here, we followed up on the most statistically significant results from two GWA studies: a nonsynonymous SNP (nsSNP) case-control study of 13,378 SNPs in 3,400 affected individuals and 3,300 controls and the WTCCC study using an Affymetrix 500K Mapping Array GWA GeneChip on 2,000 cases and 3,000 controls.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	There was a substantial overlap of samples (1,834 cases and 1,134 controls) between these studies, but we still had independent samples available for follow-up (up to 4,000 affected individuals and 5,000 controls available from the same DNA collections and 2,997 parent-child trios)
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Based on the WTCCC GWA study, we initially genotyped 11 SNPs with TaqMan technology that had shown association with P <= 1.64 x 10-5 (with five having P values < 5 x 10-7) from 11 chromosome regions not previously associated with T1D.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We genotyped samples from 4,000 affected individuals and 5,000 controls and from 2,997 parent-child trios that were independent of the WTCCC study (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 2 online).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Four of these regions showed convincing evidence of disease association: chromosomes 12q24, 12q13, 16p13 and 18p11 in independent cases and controls (P <= 1.82 x 10-6), in families (P = 5.23 x 10-3 to 1.07 x 10-6) and overall (P = 1.15 x 10-14 to 1.52 x 10-20) (Table 1, Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	1 online).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Results from SNPs in the T1D-associated MHC region will be presented elsewhere and were excluded from the analyses presented here
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We developed and applied a strategy for follow-up genotyping as a first step toward defining the disease association of the region.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Our aims were to explore in a preliminary way (i) whether there were SNPs even more strongly associated with T1D in a region, (ii) whether the T1D association was due to one or more causal variants and (iii) more precisely where those variants might be within the region (Supplementary Note online)
0	NA	PTPN2	NA	INTRO	On chromosome 18p11, the 114-kb region of strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) contained only one gene: PTPN2 (encoding T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase) (Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	1).
1	NA	PTPN2	rs2542151	INTRO	We selected 11 SNPs from this interval for genotyping based on their pattern of LD with the original SNP found to be associated in the WTCCC study (rs2542151); two SNPs in introns 3 (rs1893217) and 7 (rs478582) of PTPN2 were more associated with T1D than the original WTCCC SNP and were independently associated with disease (Supplementary Table 3 online).
0	NA	PTPN2	NA	INTRO	We also resequenced nine of the ten exons of PTPN2 and 3 kb of each of the 3' and 5' regions, uncovering 19 new SNPs and 7 new deletion-insertion polymorphisms.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We did not identify any coding variants or obvious splice mutations (Supplementary Note).
0	NA	PTPN2	NA	INTRO	However, noncoding variants could alter expression of the alternative PTPN2 45-kDa isoform, which is known to dephosphorylate STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription), a major regulator of immune signaling, including in the IL-2 pathway
1	NA	NA	rs17696736	INTRO	On chromosome 12q24, the most WTCCC-associated SNP , , rs17696736 (ref.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	), is located within a large (>1.2-Mb) LD block that contains several genes of possible functional relevance to T1D (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	1 (ref.)).
1	NA	SH2B3	rs17696736	INTRO	We genotyped four SNPs for which the LD r2 values with rs17696736 ranged from 0.59 to 0.82; rs3184504, an nsSNP in exon 3 of SH2B3 encoding a pleckstrin homology domain (R262W), had the highest association (P = 1.73 x 10-21; odds ratio (OR) = 1.33, 95% confidence interval (c.i.)
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	= 1.26-1.42).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	This single nsSNP was sufficient to model the association of the entire region (Supplementary Table 3)
1	NA	NA	rs12708716	INTRO	In the 16p13 region, SNP rs12708716, which was found to be associated with T1D in the WTCCC study (ref.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	), remained the most associated after genotyping of additional SNPs (Supplementary Note).
1	NA	KIAA0350	rs12708716	INTRO	LD between HapMap SNPs and rs12708716 localized the association to intron 18 of KIAA0350 (Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	1).
1	NA	KIAA0350	NA	INTRO	The KIAA0350 LD block is flanked by two strong functional candidate genes, CIITA (activator of the MHC class II gene transcription) and SOCS1 (suppressor of cytokine signaling).
1	NA	KIAA0350	NA	INTRO	We resequenced exonic and flanking sequences and genotyped SNPs from these two genes, but neither was responsible for the observed association in KIAA0350 (Supplementary Note).
1	NA	KIAA0350	NA	INTRO	We resequenced the 24 exons and potentially regulatory 5' and 3' sequences of KIAA0350 and found 12 new SNPs, none of which were an obvious functional candidate (Supplementary Note).
0	NA	dexamethasone-induced transcript	NA	INTRO	We also note that the dexamethasone-induced transcript (DEXI) may also be in the LD-defined region; further resequencing and genotyping of the entire region is required
1	NA	KIAA0350	NA	INTRO	KIAA0350 is a widely expressed and highly conserved transcript of unknown function with a recognized putative C-type lectin domain encoded by exon 14 (according to Ensembl; see URL below).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	However, alignment of the domain across species suggested that this domain cannot be considered functional based on homology alone.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Further bioinformatics analyses showed that exon 12 may encode an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) (Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	2 and the T1DBase PosterPages (see URL below) ).
0	NA	SH2B3	NA	INTRO	ITAMs bind proteins such as SH2B3 (SH2B adaptor protein 3) (also known as LNK, Lymphocyte adaptor protein) that contain SH2 signaling domains.
1	erythroblastic leukemia viral	SH2B3	NA	INTRO	We also noted that SH2B3 binds ERBB3 (v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 3 (avian)) (ref.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	), which has the highest association with T1D in the other chromosome 12 region, 12q13.
0	autoimmune pancreatic	NA	NA	INTRO	Therefore, we identified potential functional links between the new candidate genes and previously identified loci in interactions between antigen presenting cells (for example, dendritic cells) and T lymphocytes during T cell repertoire formation and immune inflammatory events leading to autoimmune pancreatic beta-cell destruction in T1D
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Of the remaining loci, two are probably false positives (2p13 and 1q32; P > 0.7 in the new 4,000 cases and 5,000 controls), and five could be true effects (P < 0.05; Table 1).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We followed up on the SNPs in chromosome regions 4q27, 5q14, 2q11, 10p11 and 12p13 in the families, obtaining weak (P <= 0.0307) or no (P >= 0.0653 for 5q14 and 12p13) support for disease association (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 2)
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We carried out further genotyping of the 4q27 region (Supplementary Fig.
0	diabetes	IL2	rs6534347	INTRO	1) because (i) it contains the IL2 gene, which has been identified as a susceptibility gene in the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse model of T1D; (ii) the chromosome 10p15 region, containing the gene encoding the IL-2 receptor, IL2RA, is associated with T1D and autoimmune thyroid disease and (iii) using imputation, the WTCCC study reported a SNP (rs6534347) in the 4q27 region with an apparently strong association with T1D (OR = 1.30, 95% c.i.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	= 1.10-1.55; P = 4.48 x 10-7).
0	NA	IL-2	NA	INTRO	We resequenced the region encompassing genes IL2 through IL21 and found 178 new SNPs but observed neither IL2 and IL21 coding variants nor obvious regulatory or splice variants (Supplementary Note).Follow-up genotyping provided some support for association of this region with T1D, but finer localization within the 200-kb region on chromosome 4q27 was not possible owing to strong LD (Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	1).
0	NA	IL-2	rs3136534	INTRO	We did not obtain support for the presence of an effect as large as OR = 1.3 in the region from IL2 to IL21; our most associated SNP was rs3136534, 3' of IL2 (OR = 1.11, 95% c.i.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	= 1.05-1.18; Pall cases and controls = 1.62 x 10-4; Supplementary Note)
0	NA	IL-2 receptor	NA	INTRO	The IL-2 receptor, which is critical for immune function and regulation, is a trimeric molecule of alpha (IL2RA), beta (IL2RB, also known as CD122) and gamma (IL2RG) chains.
0	NA	IL-2 receptor	rs3218253	INTRO	We noted that SNP rs3218253 in intron 1 of IL2RB shows evidence of T1D association in the WTCCC study (P = 1.59 x 10-4), but we found no convincing support for T1D association (Supplementary Note).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	This suggests that the WTCCC result was a false positive, emphasizing, along with other findings presented here, the fact that most results in a GWA study at P < 10-6 are false positives, even in a sample as large as that used in the WTCCC study
1	NA	PTPN22	rs763361	INTRO	Using 2,700 case and 3,500 control follow-up samples, we genotyped 14 out of 7,446 nsSNPs from the nsSNP GWA study that had minor allele frequencies (MAF) >= 0.01 and P values <1 x 10-3 (Table 2 and Supplementary Table 2).In addition to the previously reported PTPN22 and IFIH1 region associations, we found one other locus with consistent statistical support for a T1D association: rs763361 in the T lymphocyte costimulation gene CD226 (ref.)
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	on chromosome 18q22 (Pfollow-up = 9.46 x 10-6 and Poverall = 1.38 x 10-8; Table 2 and Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	1).
1	NA	CD226	NA	INTRO	The CD226 nsSNP could alter splicing of exon 7 of the gene (Supplementary Note)
1	NA	CD226	rs1445898	INTRO	In addition to CD226, we found evidence (Pall cases and controls <= 8.25 x 10-4) for nsSNPs rs1445898 (in CAPSL on 5p13), rs380421 (in C20orf168 on 20q13), rs3194051 and rs6897932 (in IL7R on 5p13) and rs213950 (in CFTR on 7q31) (Table 2).In the family collection (2,997 parent-child trios), we obtained consistent evidence of disease association for all of these nsSNPs (that is, P < 0.05 and allelic ORs in the same direction as the original study) except rs1445898 (in CAPSL; P = 0.0885) (Table 2 and Supplementary Table 2).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Confirmation of these potential associations will require further studies
0	NA	SH2B3	rs3184504	INTRO	The SH2B3 nsSNP rs3184504 was originally excluded from our nsSNP GWA analysis, as the genotype clustering was of marginal quality.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Recently, we attempted to recover additional poorly clustered nsSNPs from the nsSNP GWA study by identifying for each nsSNP the batches of cases or controls lowering the quality of the fluorescent signal and excluding them.
0	NA	SH2B3	rs3184504	INTRO	Although it reduced the sample size, this exclusion improved the clustering of nsSNP rs3184504 in SH2B3 (P = 2.0 x 10-12; OR = 1.30, 95% c.i.
1	NA	PTPN22	NA	INTRO	= 1.20-1.39 in 3,712 cases and 2,682 controls), making it the nsSNP with the second highest association with T1D in the study, after PTPN22 (Table 2)
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	One other outcome of the nsSNP scan analyses, regarding geographical variability in nsSNP allele frequencies, pertains to two potential questions.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	First, does population structure increase the false-positive rate in case-control association studies (see Methods)?
0	infectious disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Second, are the allelically variable regions of genes responsible for host resistance to infectious disease, which are subject to selection pressures, also candidate susceptibility loci for autoimmune disease.
1	NA	IFIH1	rs1990760	INTRO	For example, the IFIH1 nsSNP rs1990760 (ref.
0	autoimmune thyroid disease	NA	NA	INTRO	), which is associated with T1D and autoimmune thyroid disease (Tables  2 and 3), showed some variability in frequency across Great Britain (3.11% from north to south; P = 6.33 x 10-4; Supplementary Table 4) and is known to function as the pathogen recognition receptor (PRR) for picornavirus and enterovirus RNA molecules.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We analyzed the nsSNPs for allele frequency differences between geographical regions of Great Britain (Supplementary Table 4).
0	NA	TLR1	N248S	INTRO	The most geographically variable nsSNP was in the PRR Toll-like receptor 1 (TLR1), N248S (rs4833095) on chromosome 4p14 (Supplementary Table 4).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	This region also showed extreme geographical variation in the WTCCC study.
0	NA	TLR1	NA	INTRO	The TLR1 nsSNP was even more stratified than the three nsSNPs analyzed in the well-established geographically variable lactase persistence gene (LCT) (Supplementary Table 4, which has been under recent selection to allow adult consumption of cows' milk.
0	NA	TLR2	NA	INTRO	In a heterodimeric receptor with TLR2, TLR1 recognizes lipopeptides from Mycobacteria, the causes of leprosy and tuberculosis (Supplementary Note).
0	NA	TLR1	N248S	INTRO	The SNP in TLR1 causing the N248S variantand/or other variants in LD with it in the neighboring TLR6 and TLR10 genes could have been under selection for resistance to these and other infectious diseases (Supplementary Note and Supplementary Table 4), thus helping to explain their extreme geographical variation across Great Britain and Europe and between the major ethnic groups (Supplementary Note).
0	NA	TLR1	N248S	INTRO	However, the SNP causing the TLR1 N248S variant (rs4833095) was not associated in any convincing way with T1D (Supplementary Table 4)
0	Graves' disease	NA	NA	INTRO	As the autoimmune thyroid disease Graves' disease is known to share genetic susceptibility with T1D, we genotyped 13 T1D-associated SNPs in 2,200 individuals with Graves' disease.
1	NA	AFF3	rs9653442	INTRO	We found some evidence of association for 2q11 (rs9653442, intergenic AFF3 to LOC150577), 4q27 (rs17388568, in Tenr-IL2), 5p13 (rs1445898, in CAPSL), 18p11 (rs1893217 and rs478582, in PTPN2) and 18q22 (rs763361, in CD226) (Table 3 and Supplementary Table 5 online).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Except for the SNP in the Tenr-IL2 region, all alleles were associated in the same direction as in T1D.
1	NA	IFIH1	rs1990760	INTRO	We note that the IFIH1 nsSNP, rs1990760 (ref.
0	Graves' disease	NA	NA	INTRO	), also showed some evidence of association with Graves' disease (Table 3).
0	autoimmune disease	NA	NA	INTRO	These data suggest that these genes may be acting as more generalized susceptibility loci for autoimmune disease
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Some, but not all, authors predict that in human association studies, the distribution of genotypes between unlinked disease loci will deviate from a multiplicative model, and hence, statistical power could be improved in the detection of novel loci using gene-gene interaction analyses.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In case-only gene-gene interaction analyses between the new candidates and the known T1D loci, we did not find any evidence of deviation from the model of multiplicative (random) effects, sex effects or age-at-diagnosis effects (Table 4).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We can model that the previously identified and newly associated SNPs account for approximately 48% of familial clustering of T1D, compared with an estimated 41% for the MHC region alone.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Together, and estimating an environmental contribution of approximately 20% (ref.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	), about one-third remains unexplained.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	This residual could be due to numerous as-yet-undetected susceptibility loci, which we expect to range in relative risk effect size up to 20 %, consistent with the expected and emerging L-shaped distribution of allelic effect sizes for the ten loci so far confirmed (Fig.

0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Rare causal variants will also have a role
1	pancreatic	PTPN2	NA	INTRO	Our results place the genetic basis of T1D in a genome-wide context.The known genes and the new candidates (such as PTPN2 and CD226) indicate that T1D is caused, in a permissive environment, by a combination of immune recognition of pancreatic islet antigens (including insulin), T cell repertoire development, immune regulation and other unknown pathways (for example, a pathway including the potential candidate KIAA0350 protein) that have common functional variation
