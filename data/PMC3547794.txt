0	lung cancer	SLC17A8	NA	METHODS	To determine the expression levels of NRIH4 and SLC17A8, we collected 46 paired lung cancer tissues from the patients who had undergone resection between June 2009 and April 2010 from the Nantong Cancer Hospital.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	METHODS	All cases were histopathologically diagnosed lung cancer without radiotherapy or chemotherapy before surgical operation
0	NA	SLC17A8	NA	METHODS	Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to determine the mRNA expressions of NRIH4 and SLC17A8.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	METHODS	RNAs from lung cancer tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues were isolated with the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We used TaqMan gene expression probes (Applied Biosystems Inc.) to perform qRT-PCR assay.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	All real-time PCR reactions, including no-template controls and real-time minus controls, were run by using the ABI7900 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems Inc.) and performed in triplicate.
0	NA	beta-actin	NA	METHODS	beta-actin gene was used to normalize the expression levels.
0	NA	beta-actin	NA	METHODS	A relative expression was calculated using the equation 2-DeltaCt (Ct, Cycle Threshold), in which DeltaCt  = Ct gene-Ct beta-actin
0	NA	NA	rs12296850	METHODS	We applied the publicly available data from GTEx (Genotype-Tissue Expression) eQTL Browser, eQTL.Chicago.edu and Gene Expression Analysis Based on Imputed Genotypes (see URLs) to perform cis-eQTL analysis and evaluated the cis association between rs12296850 and the expression of nearby genes in a variety of cells/tissues, including lymphoblastoid cell lines, monocytes, fibroblasts, liver and brain tissues
