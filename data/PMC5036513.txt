0	cancers	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	As nearly 50% of cancer patients have radiotherapy, our work could benefit many people
0	cancers	NA	NA	INTRO	Radiotherapy is used in the treatment of up to 50% of cancer patients and around 40% of long-term cancer survivors underwent radiotherapy at some point in their treatment.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	For example, approximately half of the 1.1 million men diagnosed with prostate cancer worldwide each year receive radiotherapy, and the 5-year relative survival rates approach 100% for non-metastatic disease.
0	toxicity	NA	NA	INTRO	Although modern treatments minimize radiation doses to surrounding normal tissues, some men develop long-term toxicity.
0	toxicity	NA	NA	INTRO	The risk of severe toxicity limits doses, which aim to keep the prevalence below 5%.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Mild and moderate effects are common (10-50% of those treated), impact negatively on quality-of-life, and are an important factor when men consider treatment options
0	cancers	NA	NA	INTRO	There is a need for a test that reflects a cancer patient's radiosensitivity and predicts the likelihood of toxicity.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Many assays have been explored but none proved sufficiently reliable for clinical application.
0	toxicity	NA	NA	INTRO	Over the past 15 years interest increased in identifying the genetic variants associated with risk of toxicity.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The rationale behind the work is that a future test based on a germline polygenic risk score will not suffer from the poor reproducibility associated with other assays measuring radiosensitivity
0	error bars	NA	NA	INTRO	Mutations associated with well-characterized radiosensitivity syndromes such as ataxia telangiectasia are rare and do not explain the general inter-individual variation in toxicity following radiotherapy.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Rather, it is hypothesized that common genetic variants, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) account for most of the heritability of radiosensitivity.
0	toxicity	NA	NA	INTRO	Studies have begun to identify common variants associated with radiotherapy toxicity.
0	toxicity	HSPB1	rs2868371	INTRO	Candidate gene studies showed rs2868371 in HSPB1 (MIM 602195) and rs1800469 in TGFB1 (MIM 190180) are associated with late effects of lung radiotherapy; and rs1800629 in TNF (MIM 191160) and rs1139793 in TXNRD2 (MIM 606448) are risk SNPs for late toxicity following breast radiotherapy.
0	toxicity	TANC1	NA	INTRO	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified a locus on chr11q14.3 associated with rectal bleeding and a locus on chr2q24.1 within TANC1 (MIM 611397) associated with overall toxicity following radiotherapy for prostate cancer.
0	toxicity	NA	NA	INTRO	Another study showed more associations at the p-value < 5 x 10- 7 level than expected by chance, providing the strongest evidence to date that many common genetic variants are associated with risk of toxicity
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Recently published GWAS have limitations that we aimed to overcome by using a meta-analysis approach.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The published studies used a multi-stage approach, where a small first-stage cohort was analyzed for a genome-wide panel of SNPs and only the most significant SNPs were genotyped in validation datasets.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Thus, true positive SNPs were likely missed because they were not tested in the full set of individuals.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Here, the Radiogenomics Consortium undertook a meta-analysis of four GWAS in order to maximize statistical power to discover additional risk variants.
0	toxicity	NA	NA	INTRO	It is known that risk factors for late toxicity include not only genetics but also dosimetric parameters, co-morbidities, and patient demographics.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The latter factors can vary between cohorts as can the treatment (e.g.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	in prostate cancer: external beam or brachytherapy; type of fractionation - large or small doses per fraction; variable use of hormone therapy; variable use of surgery) and scales used to assess toxicity.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	There were concerns, therefore, whether the heterogeneity across cohorts might limit our ability to identify variants
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	This study is important because our ability to identify enough SNPs for a risk profile for clinical implementation is dependent on combining multiple heterogeneous cohorts.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The aim was to show that multi-center radiotherapy cohorts could be harmonized and analyzed to identify risk SNPs by increasing the number of individuals analyzed in a single stage.

0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Identification of multiple loci in this single-stage meta-analysis versus single loci in published GWAS that used a staged approach is consistent with the increased power.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The meta-analysis showed that heterogeneity in radiotherapy datasets is not a barrier for future multi-cohort radiogenomic studies.
0	haemorrhage	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The absence of significant SNPs associated with rectal bleeding is consistent with the relatively limited statistical power.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Most common variants identified via GWAS have more modest effects (ORs 1.15 to 1.5) than this study was powered to detect.
0	haemorrhage	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our group previously reported an excess of associations at the p < 5 x 10- 7 level for rectal bleeding showing many SNPs should be identified as sample sizes increase.
0	toxicity	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In addition, our current approach of dichotomizing toxicity at grade 0 versus grade 1 or worse and considering two years of follow-up may not be optimal for rectal bleeding, which could be explored as our radiogenomic cohorts increase
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The significant SNPs lie in non-coding regions, as is common in GWAS where ~ 64% of identified SNPs lie in enhancer regions.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Gene enhancer elements are noncoding segments of DNA involved in regulating transcriptional programs.
0	allergy	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Their location is predicted by DNase I hypersensitive regions of open chromatin flanked by sties of histone methylation.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	These enhancers can be active (associated with the acylation of lysine 27 of histone 3 [H3K27Ac]) or repressed (correlated with histone marks H3K27Me3 and H3K9Me3).
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Although premature to speculate on the functional consequences of these SNPs, they lie in intronic regions of genes that are expressed in tissues exposed to radiation during treatment of prostate cancer and are involved in the symptoms experienced by men having radiotherapy for this malignancy.
0	toxicity	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Fine mapping studies and functional characterization of causal variants contained within these loci should expand our understanding of the biology underlying the pathogenesis of radiotherapy toxicity
0	NA	NA	rs17599026	DISCUSS	rs17599026 was genotyped to check the quality of the imputed data from RADIOGEN and RAPPER.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Direct genotyping confirmed the high quality of the imputation, but we were unable to genotype directly the other two SNPs for which imputed data were used for all four cohorts.
0	NA	NA	rs7720298	DISCUSS	rs7720298 had high imputation information scores (> 0.95) in all three studies of urinary decreased stream, lending confidence to this association.
0	toxicity	NA	rs11230328	DISCUSS	However, rs11230328 had a lower imputation quality (< 0.70) in two of the four studies of overall toxicity, and it is not present in the latest 1000 Genomes Project release (v5a; 05/02/2013).
0	NA	NA	rs11230328	DISCUSS	Thus, rs11230328 may represent a spurious association
0	toxicity	NA	NA	DISCUSS	None of the previously studied candidate gene SNPs for radiotherapy toxicity were among the top loci identified in this meta-analysis, consistent with a recent validation study showing no evidence for association between 92 candidate SNPs and radiotherapy toxicity among ~ 1600 individuals treated with radiotherapy for breast or prostate cancer.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	No SNP discovered in previous GWAS was identified in this de novo analysis, likely due to methodological differences.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The published locus on chr2q24.1, identified in RADIOGEN and replicated in RAPPER and Gene-PARE, was excluded because the MAFs of the tagging SNPs were < 5%, the threshold set in this meta-analysis to maximize statistical power.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Subsequent to the meta-analysis, we tested SNPs in the chr2q24.1 locus for replication in CCI (the only cohort not included in the initial publication) using the methods of the originally published paper.
0	toxicity	NA	rs264651	DISCUSS	All seven previously reported SNPs showed a consistent direction of association with overall toxicity in CCI, and rs264651 showed a statistically significant association (linear regression beta = 0.66; 95% CI 0.06, 1.27; p-value = 0.03).
0	toxicity	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The locus was also tested for association with the three individual toxicity endpoints investigated in this paper, and appeared to be predominantly associated with urinary toxicity (Table S5).
0	NA	NA	rs7582141	DISCUSS	SNPs rs7582141, rs6432512, rs264588, and rs264631 were significantly associated with an increased risk for decreased urinary stream and increased urinary frequency (meta-analysis p-values < 0.05, Table S5).
0	NA	NA	rs264663	DISCUSS	The directions of the associations were consistent across the other three SNPs, with rs264663 and rs264651 reaching statistical significance for urinary frequency.
0	haemorrhage	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The direction of the association of six of the seven SNPs was consistent for the rectal bleeding endpoint, but none of the SNPs approached statistical significance, suggesting that the urinary endpoints are predominantly driving the association of this locus with overall toxicity.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This finding thus supports the initial report that chr2q24.1 is a risk locus for late radiotherapy toxicity in prostate cancer.
0	haemorrhage	NA	rs7120482	DISCUSS	rs7120482 on chr11q14.3 was previously identified in Gene-PARE and replicated in a combined dataset that included RADIOGEN and CCI, but the association with rectal bleeding was restricted to a recessive inheritance model.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In this meta-analysis, dominant and recessive models were not considered in order to avoid an increased burden of multiple comparisons correction.
0	NA	NA	rs7120482	DISCUSS	Subsequent to this meta-analysis, we tested rs7120482 for replication in RAPPER (the only cohort not included in that initial publication) using the methods of the originally published paper.
0	haemorrhage	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The initial association with rectal bleeding was not replicated in RAPPER (odds ratio = 0.74; 95% CI 0.08, 7.33; p-value = 0.79).
0	toxicity	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This lack of replication could be due to differences in the radiotherapy regimen or scoring of toxicity - the incidence of rectal bleeding was low in RAPPER (3%) compared with the other studies (10% to 18%).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, the initial association fell just short of genome-wide significance and might be a false positive result.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	At this early stage of radiogenomic GWAS we expect some initial associations to be lost as sample sizes increase and false-positive findings are reduced, as seen in other GWAS meta-analyses.
0	erectile dysfunction	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Finally, Gene-PARE previously identified risk SNPs for erectile dysfunction, but this endpoint was not assessed in the other studies in the meta-analysis.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Thus, previously identified SNPs remain important, and the meta-analysis reports additional loci
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This study has several strengths.
0	toxicity	NA	NA	DISCUSS	First, toxicity was assessed prospectively in all four studies, which minimizes recall bias.
0	toxicity	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Second, baseline information ensures any SNP-toxicity associations identified occur because of the radiotherapy rather than any pre-existing (possibly tumor-related) symptoms.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Third, a multivariable approach accounted for relevant treatment and clinical variables.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Radiogenomics involves phenotypes that occur in response to an environmental exposure (i.e.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	therapeutic radiation) that is measurable and can be adjusted for.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Fourth, reliable and current imputation methods were used to obtain comparable and dense SNP maps across the four studies, allowing meta-analysis of studies involving different SNP genotyping platforms.
0	toxicity	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Without imputation, only 15,144 SNPs were common to all four datasets, reducing the likelihood of identifying SNPs associated with late radiotherapy toxicity
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This study has limitations.
0	toxicity	NA	NA	DISCUSS	First, the four studies were designed independently and involved different methods for recording toxicity.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Endpoints needed harmonizing and the approach might be sub-optimal, but serves as a useful guide for future radiogenomics studies involving multiple cohorts.
0	toxicity	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Although endpoints were dichotomized to minimize differences in toxicity grades across the cohorts, the simulation experiment showed minimal loss of statistical power.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Second, there was the heterogeneity in radiotherapy protocols.
0	toxicity	NA	NA	DISCUSS	For example, Gene-PARE included individuals who received brachytherapy with EBRT, which increases urinary toxicity.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Similarly, the proportion of individuals who received androgen deprivation differed across the studies.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This heterogeneity was adjusted for using multivariable analysis and by a meta-analysis approach.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Importantly, none of the top SNPs showed evidence of heterogeneity in effect size across studies (Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, Table 8).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The first SNPs identified are those that rise above such noise in the data, and the significance of our work is that we can find variants despite imperfect datasets.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We attempted to control for differences in radiation dose by adjusting for total biologically effective dose in each GWAS.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, this is a surrogate for the doses received by specific normal tissues.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Future cohorts with detailed dosimetry data to the different organs at risk will improve on our ability to identify SNPs.
0	toxicity	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The heterogeneity in cohorts should be embraced, as any predictive test must use SNPs that are associated with toxicity across treatment centers and protocols.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Last, in order to minimize confounding by population structure, the present analysis was restricted to individuals of European ancestry.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	It will be important for future studies to focus on other ancestral groups, both for replication of the loci identified here and for discovery of additional loci
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	While this study was successful in identifying radiosensitivity SNPs via a meta-analysis of GWAS, it is modestly sized compared with GWAS of other diseases and traits, and it should be viewed as the starting point for expanded radiogenomics studies.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Given that our study was not powered to detect SNPs with odds ratio < 2, many true positive SNPs will have been missed.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Also, though the SNPs identified here reach statistical significance and show consistency across multiple independent studies, there is still a possibility that they will fail to replicate in other cohorts.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This is a challenge in GWAS, but meta-analysis and replication studies have proved successful in validating hundreds of risk SNPs for a wide variety of diseases and phenotypes.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Future large GWAS meta-analyses will identify additional SNPs, and this work is underway.
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The Radiogenomics Consortium is a participant in the OncoArray Network, which is a large collaborative effort to gain new insight into the genetic architecture and mechanisms underlying several cancers as well as outcomes related to the their treatment.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Approximately 5000 additional DNA samples from individuals treated with radiotherapy for prostate cancer are being genotyped using the customized OncoArray, and meta-analysis of this greatly expanded set of GWAS data using the methods developed in this paper will uncover additional risk SNPs, provide a platform for further validation of the SNPs identified here, and serve as the basis for future post-GWAS analyses on these confirmed loci
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The last decade saw a rapid expansion of knowledge of the genetics of disease susceptibility in the general population.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Numerous large collaborative GWAS showed that polygenic risk profiles can be built based on multiple SNPs each conferring small effects but together a significant proportion of susceptibility to common diseases.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	With the rapid decline in costs for genetic testing, there is growing acceptance that risk prediction models incorporating genetic and environmental factors will be important in future healthcare provision.
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In 2012 there were an estimated 32.6 million people alive five years after being diagnosed with cancer (http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/international/statistics.htm), and many will be living with the consequences of treatment.
0	toxicity	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Research developing models predicting susceptibility to long-term radiation effects is important and the findings reported here shows that heterogeneous radiotherapy cohorts can be combined to identify common genetic variants associated with toxicity.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The work provides a basis for larger collaborative efforts to identify enough variants for a future test involving polygenic risk profiling
