0	retinopathy and nephropathy complications	NA	NA	INTRO	Nephropathy constitutes a frequent and serious complication of diabetes mellitus.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	Approximately 20%-40% of patients with type two diabetes (T2D) will develop diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and many will further progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) via a relentless decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR).
0	Kidneys in Diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	According to Yang et al, the increased prevalence of diabetic nephropathy (DN) in Taiwan is the main cause of the increases in prevalence and incidence of ESRD.
0	T2DM-ESRD	NA	NA	INTRO	Notably, analysis of the international statistics collected in the US Renal Data System indicates that Taiwan has the highest incidence and the second highest prevalence of ESRD worldwide.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	Several risk factors for developing DN have been identified, such as age, duration of diabetes, albuminuria grade, early GFR decline, increased or variability of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and systolic blood pressure (SBP), serum uric acid, presence of concomitant microvascular complications and positive family history.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Additionally, hereditary components are considered to constitute a significant risk factor for DN.
0	NA	TCF7L2	NA	INTRO	Numerous genes, such as TCF7L2, ACE and SHROOM3 were identified to be associated with DN through a candidate gene approach, genome-wide association study (GWAS) or meta-analysis.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	However, the genetic mechanism of DN remains unclear.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	Furthermore, research suggests that the presence of diabetic retinopathy (DR) may be considered as a vital clinical biomarker for the diagnosis of DKD among patients with diabetes and microalbuminuria (MAU).
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	DN and DR comprise two major microvascular complications of diabetes and occur with a high concordance rate in patients with diabetes.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	Studies have suggested that these two diabetic complications might share common pathogeneses, such as glucose metabolism, angiogenesis, inflammation and oxidative stress.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Therefore, genetic loci with pleiotropic effects, whereby one genetic locus can affect more than one phenotype, may underlie the association between DR and DKD phenotypes.
0	NA	IL-10	NA	INTRO	However, to date only a few genetic polymorphisms have been reported to be associated with these two complications, including interleukin (IL)-10 and SLC2A1.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	The aim of this study is to investigate whether DR-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) exert a pleiotropic effect on renal function outcomes among patients with diabetes.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The DR-related SNPs were identified by replicating published SNPs and via GWAS among patients with T2D in Taiwan.

0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Here, we investigated whether DR-related SNPs affect renal function among patients with diabetes.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We identified a total of 33 DR-related SNPs by replicating SNPs on candidate genes previously identified through meta-analyses and GWAS (10 SNPs were replicated) and through GWAS performed on our subjects with DR with eGFR >60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and ACR <300 mg/g (23 SNPs were identified).
0	retinopathy and nephropathy complications	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The DR-related SNPs contributed no individual or cumulative genetic effect on the nephropathy risk, eGFR status or ERFD outcome among patients with diabetes, as confirmed by multivariate logistic regression models
0	retinopathy	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Current literature suggests that the presence of one pre-existing microvascular complication (retinopathy or nephropathy) may contribute to the development of another.
0	retinopathy and nephropathy complications	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Retinal vascular geometry can independently predict the incidence of renal dysfunction and may be a useful tool to identify individuals at high risk for renal disease early in the course of type one diabetes (T1D).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	El-Asrar et al  reported that patients with T1D and DR were 13.39 times more likely to develop DKD than those without DR.
0	eye damage	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Moreover, Yang et al  reported that the urine proteome specific for eye damage could predict chronic renal insufficiency (eGFR, 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) in a 5.3 years prospective cohort for T2D
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, only a few genetic reports support possible pleiotropy between DN and DR. Hosseini et al  tested previous suggestive signals for DN for association with severe DR, but none of the loci showed a significant association after multiple testing.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In the present study, we identified DR-related SNPs from GWAS and performed replication by using patients with DR and MAU among the Han population in Taiwan.
0	NA	STAT4	NA	DISCUSS	In addition, some of the identified genes, such as guanylate cyclase 1 soluble subunit beta 1, signal transducer and activator of transcription-4 and G protein-coupled receptor 35 were reportedly related to renal perfusion and renin release, cell proliferation and differentiation and vascular endothelial relaxation.
0	retinopathy and nephropathy complications	NA	NA	DISCUSS	These pathophysiological associations may be related to nephropathy or diabetic complications; however, none of the genetic variants significantly correlated with DN risk among patients with T2D in previous studies or the present study.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This may be owing to limited statistical power or might suggest the lack of genetic pleiotropy effect among these two tested diabetic complications
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We recognize several limitations that may contribute to the lack of significant findings in the present study.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	First, a limited number of DR-related SNPs were identified, which may be due to the small sample size for the process of genetic marker selection, although a matched case-control study design was used in the present study to control for potential confounding factors.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, the effect sizes obtained from such matching may differ from the effect sizes in the whole sample.
0	NA	NA	rs6841985	DISCUSS	Therefore, we performed an analysis in which we replicated 33 identified DR-SNPs in a larger population (234 DR and 2368 non-DR), from which 3 DR-related SNPs (rs6841985 from GWAS; rs1559438 and rs56170305 from replication) remained significantly related to DR status.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The wGRS was calculated based on the effect sizes for the three DR-related SNPs obtained from the larger population.
0	retinopathy and nephropathy complications	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, these three DR-related SNPs still contributed to no individual (see online supplementary table S7) or cumulative genetic effect on the nephropathy risk, eGFR status or ERFD outcome in the multivariate logistic regression models (see online supplementary table S8-9).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Second, the validity of association (with DR) at many of these loci is unconfirmed or lacks robust replication.
0	retinopathy	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This may be due to differences among studies regarding the phenotype definition, the method used to identify retinopathy, ethnic population or other confounding factors.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Although the self-reported DR status was used in the present study, we confirmed high consistency in our limited database between the self-reported DR status and that reported by an ophthalmologist (n=749; accuracy: 612/749=81.7%).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Furthermore, a high validity of self-report of laser treatments of DR, as compared with fundus photography grading, was observed in the EDIC study T1D cohort.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Third, inadequate statistical power may have contributed to the lack of significant associations between single loci and eGFR status and ERFD outcome.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Dichotomized outcomes (for eGFR and ERFD) were used in the present analyses, which may reduce the power as compared with the analysis of the outcomes as quantitative measures.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, when the continuous quantitative eGFR was considered as the outcome, and the continuous quantitative wGRS was used as predictor in the linear regression models (with the sample size increased to 3100), no significant effect of wGRS was observed on eGFR outcome even after controlling for other potential confounding factors (see online supplementary table S10).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Moreover, the logistic regression models based on conventional variables have high discriminatory power with AUC of 0.88 (on eGFR status) and 0.70 (on ERFD risk) in this study, and inclusion of genetic predictor variants (wGRS) did not significantly change the AUCs.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Based on these results, there could be either no pleiotropic effect between these two diabetic complications or the effect sizes of DR-related SNPs on eGFR status and ERFD outcomes may be small.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Therefore, larger sample sizes are warranted in these two evaluations.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The use of modified equations for calculating eGFR based on Asian populations may also be worth considering in future studies.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Lastly, the information of medical use, such as antihypertension or statin therapy, was not collected for the subjects during enrollment.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This is potentially relevant to blood pressure and lipids levels and might have confounded the results
0	retinopathy and nephropathy complications	NA	NA	CONCL	In conclusion, we identified no individual or cumulative genetic effect of the DR-related SNPs on nephropathy risk, eGFR status or ERFD outcome among patients with diabetes in Taiwan using multivariate logistic regression models.
0	NA	NA	NA	CONCL	Further evidence for the pleiotropy of microvascular complications should be sought using a cohort of a larger size in the near future
