0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a public health priority for the 21st century.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Risk reduction currently revolves around lifestyle changes with much research trying to elucidate the biological underpinnings.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	We show that self-report of parental history of Alzheimer's dementia for case ascertainment in a genome-wide association study of 314,278 participants from UK Biobank (27,696 maternal cases, 14,338 paternal cases) is a valid proxy for an AD genetic study.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	After meta-analysing with published consortium data (n = 74,046 with 25,580 cases across the discovery and replication analyses), three new AD-associated loci (P < 5 x 10-8) are identified.
0	Alzheimer's disease	ADAM10	NA	ABSTRACT	These contain genes relevant for AD and neurodegeneration: ADAM10, BCKDK/KAT8 and ACE.
0	NA	VKORC1	NA	ABSTRACT	Novel gene-based loci include drug targets such as VKORC1 (warfarin dose).
0	Alzheimer's disease	TOMM40	NA	ABSTRACT	We report evidence that the association of SNPs in the TOMM40 gene with AD is potentially mediated by both gene expression and DNA methylation in the prefrontal cortex.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	However, it is likely that multiple variants are affecting the trait and gene methylation/expression.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Our discovered loci may help to elucidate the biological mechanisms underlying AD and, as they contain genes that are drug targets for other diseases and disorders, warrant further exploration for potential precision medicine applications
0	Alzheimer's disease	apolipoprotein E	NA	INTRO	The genetic epidemiology of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) has advanced over the last decade, with >20 independent loci associated with the disease in addition to APOE.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Presently, the largest meta-analytic genome-wide association study (GWAS) for LOAD employed a two-stage study design.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	First, 17,008 cases were compared to 37,154 controls.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	A total of 11,632 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with P < 1 x 10-3 from this meta-analysis were included in the second stage that compared 8,572 cases to 11,312 controls.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	A meta-analysis of the SNPs included in stages 1 and 2 was also performed
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	One difficulty in traditional studies of AD is case ascertainment:either directly for prevalent cases or indirectly through prospective cohort studies for incident cases.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	A recent GWAS study on a subset of the UK Biobank cohort used information from family history (parent or first-degree relative with AD or dementia) as a proxy-phenotype for the participants.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	When meta-analysed with the GWAS summary data highlighted above, four new loci were identified
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	The UK Biobank proxy-phenotype AD question, which is used here, does not incorporate biomarker data that are required for a clinical diagnosis.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	However, it is easy to administer at scale and we show that it has a near-unit genetic correlation with the AD results from the LOAD meta-analysis, where many of the samples also lacked a confirmed diagnosis by biomarker levels or autopsy
0	dementia	NA	NA	INTRO	In the present study, we related proxy-phenotype information on dementia (i.e., reporting a parent with Alzheimer's dementia or dementia) to genetic data from 314,278 individuals from the UK Biobank cohort to identify new AD-associated loci.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	This sample includes individuals from the previous proxy-phenotype AD study by Liu et al.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	GWA studies were conducted separately for maternal and paternal AD due to a 1.7-fold difference in disease prevalence:9.6% and 5.5%, respectively.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The summary statistics from these models were meta-analysed with those from the largest publicly available case-control study.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Sensitivity analyses showed that an overlap of controls in the maternal and paternal GWAS did not bias the results.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Genetic correlation analysis showed the self-reported measure of parental AD to be an accurate proxy for clinical diagnosis, validating the global meta-analysis.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In addition, we tested for causal evidence of our SNP-AD associations being mediated through gene expression and DNA methylation in the prefrontal cortex
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	UK Biobank data (http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk) were collected on over 500,000 individuals aged between 37 and 73 years from across Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland) at the study baseline (2006-2010), including health, cognitive and genetic data

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Downstream quality control steps conducted for the current analysis included removing (1) those with non-British ancestry based on both self-report and a principal components analysis, (2) outliers based on heterozygosity and missingness, (3) individuals with sex chromosome configurations that were neither XX nor XY, (4) individuals whose reported sex did not match inferred sex from their genetic data and (5) individuals with >10 putative third-degree relatives from the kinship table.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	This left a sample of 408,095 individuals.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	METHODS	To remove the possibility of double contributions from sibs, whose parents will have the same AD status, we first considered a list of all participants with a relative (N = 131,790).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	A genetic relationship matrix was built for these individuals using GCTA-GRM and a relationship threshold of 0.025 was applied to exclude related individuals.

0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	METHODS	There were 314,278 instances where AD information was available on at least one parent.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	METHODS	Given the expected difference in disease prevalence due to sex differences in longevity:AD prevalence was 1.7-fold higher in mothers compared to fathers:GWA studies were performed separately for maternal and paternal AD
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The GWA studies were conducted using BGENIE.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	METHODS	The outcome variable was the residuals from a linear regression model of maternal or paternal AD on age of parent at death or at time of the offspring's self-report, assessment centre, genotype batch, array and 40 genetic principal components.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The predictor variable was the autosomal SNP and an additive model was considered
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	METHODS	The GWAS linear regression coefficients were converted to odds ratios using observed sample prevalences of 0.096 and 0.055 for maternal and paternal AD, respectively.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Subsequently, the log-odds were multiplied by two so that the effect sizes are reported on the same scale as a traditional case-control design.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Briefly, the conversion to odds ratios uses the following equation, derived in Lloyd-Jones et al., where k = disease prevalence, p = population allele frequency and beta = the estimated SNP regression coefficient on the binary disease scale from the GWAS: .
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	SEs for the log-odds were then calculated based on the adjusted OR and the P-value from the initial GWAS (Supplementary Note 1).
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	METHODS	The ORs and SEs were then carried forward to a SE-weighted meta-analysis in METAL, first to create a UK Biobank parental meta-analysis, and then with the stage 2 summary output from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) study and the stage 1 output for the SNPs that did not contribute to stage 2.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	METHODS	Linkage disequilibrium score (LDSC) regression was used to estimate the genetic correlation between the maternal and paternal AD GWAS results and to test for residual confounding in the meta-analysis by examining the LDSC intercept
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The number of independent loci from the meta-analysis was determined by using the default settings in FUMA.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Independent lead SNPs had P < 5 x 10-8 and were independent at r2 < 0.6.

0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	METHODS	To test for pleiotropic associations between SNPs and AD and gene expression/DNA methylation in the brain, summary data-based Mendelian randomisation (SMR) was performed.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	GWAS summary output from the meta-analysis of UK Biobank and IGAP (sample size specified as 314,278 + 74,046 = 388,324) were included along with expression Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) summary output from the Common Mind Consortium, which contains data on >600 dorsolateral prefrontal cortex samples, and DNA methylation QTL summary output on 258 prefrontal cortex samples (age >13).

0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	METHODS	The SMR P-value highlights candidate transcripts or methylation sites through which a cis SNP may be acting on the outcome, AD.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	METHODS	The heterogeneity in dependent instruments (HEIDI) P-value indicates evidence for a single causal SNP (effect on AD is mediated through the transcript/methylation site if P > 0.05) or different SNPs affecting AD and the transcript/methylation site if P < 0.05
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	There were 27,696 cases of maternal AD (260,980 controls, prevalence of 9.6%) and 14,338 cases of paternal AD (245,941 controls, prevalence of 5.5%) in the UK Biobank.
0	Alzheimer's disease	SE	NA	RESULTS	The genetic correlation between maternal and paternal AD was not significantly different from unity (rg = 0.65, SE 0.59), although the SE is large.
0	Alzheimer's disease	SE	NA	RESULTS	Both traits had a high genetic correlation with the case-control summary output from the IGAP study: rg with maternal and paternal AD was 0.91 (SE 0.24) and 0.67 (0.40), respectively, both not significantly different from unity but with large SEs
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Prior to meta-analysing the UK Biobank parental summary statistics with the IGAP output, we investigated the influence of overlapping proxy controls in UK Biobank.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	The P-values from a single GWAS of parental AD status (0, 1 or 2 parents with AD) correlated 0.99 with those from a meta-analysis of separate maternal AD and paternal AD; the regression of -log10 P-values on each other gave an intercept of 0 and a slope of 1.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	A meta-analysis of the summary statistics from the maternal and paternal results is therefore essentially equivalent to the analysis of parental AD status.

0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The main strength of the study is the proxy-phenotype approach, which resulted in over 42,000 proxy cases for the GWAS analysis.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, the question used to determine parental AD status may have resulted in some responders being unable to discriminate Alzheimer's disease and dementia from other dementia sub-types, which have different presentations and genetic architectures.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This method of proxy-case ascertainment may have influenced the loci uncovered.
0	dementia	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Parental dementia status is partly dependent on longevity, with age being the biggest risk factor for AD.
