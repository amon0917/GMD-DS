0	AMD	NA	NA	INTRO	Advanced age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (MIM 603075) is a leading cause of visual impairment and blindness in people older than 60 years.
0	AMD	NA	NA	INTRO	AMD is a common, late-onset disease that is modified by covariates including smoking and body mass index and has recurrence ratios for siblings of a case that are 3-6-fold higher than in the general population.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The burden of this disease is increasing among the growing elderly population.
0	visual loss	NA	NA	INTRO	Among individuals aged 75 or older, approximately one in four have some sign of this disease and about one in 15 have the advanced form with visual loss.
0	AMD	NA	NA	INTRO	There are two main forms of advanced AMD.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The neovascular (NV), or 'wet', form is characterized by in-growth of choroidal vessels under the retina.
0	Geographic atrophy	NA	NA	INTRO	Geographic atrophy (GA), the advanced 'dry' form of the disease, occurs when there is full thickness loss of the outer retinal layers, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and choriocapillaris in the central macula.
0	multifactorial disease	VEGFA	NA	INTRO	Although anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy has significantly improved the functional and morphological outcomes for patients with NV disease, there are currently no effective therapies or preventive strategies for GA
0	AMD	CFH	NA	INTRO	Several genetic loci have been associated with advanced AMD, including complement pathway genes CFH, C2, CFB, C3, CFI and the ARMS2/HTRA1 region.
0	AMD	LIPC	NA	INTRO	Recent genome-wide studies in large cohorts have also identified the association between advanced AMD and variants in LIPC, a gene in the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) pathway, and TIMP3, and suggested association with other loci in the HDL pathway.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The discovery of the multiple associations with complement-related genes revealed an unanticipated central role for this pathway in disease pathogenesis.
0	AMD	NA	NA	INTRO	This has led directly to the initiation of multiple clinical trials of drugs that alter the complement pathway in AMD patients.

0	AMD	NA	NA	INTRO	To identify additional loci that contribute to the genetic risk of advanced AMD and to illuminate new candidate physiological processes that might be involved, we performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association study (GWAS) for advanced AMD that consisted cases/controls from the Tufts/Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) GWAS Cohort Study, the Michigan, Mayo, Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS), Pennsylvania (MMAP:Michigan, Mayo, AREDS, Pennsylvania Cohort Study) Cohort Study, as well as controls from the Myocardial Infarction Genetics Consortium (MIGen) and the Genetic Association Information Network (GAIN) Schizophrenia Study.

0	AMD	NA	rs1999930	DISCUSS	In this study aiming to find new genetic factors for advanced AMD, we report a genome-wide significant association near FRK/COL10A1 (rs1999930, P = 1.1 x 10-8), a locus not previously implicated in advanced AMD.

0	AMD	cone-rod homeobox	rs943080	DISCUSS	Individuals with the protective allele (C) at rs943080 may have decreased binding of CRX at the locus, leading to decreased expression of VEGFA, which in turn protects these individuals from development of neo-vascularization involved in wet AMD.

0	AMD	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The sample size of this study is the largest of all published association studies for advanced AMD to date.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	A major advantage of the study design is the careful diagnosis of cases across all cohorts.
0	AMD	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Since we included only subjects with advanced AMD in our study and excluded subjects with intermediate or large drusen, heterogeneity due to phenotype definition is reduced.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, it is possible that associations exist for other endophenotypes, like macular drusen, an early or intermediate stage of the disease, as suggested for loci in the HDL pathway
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our novel findings are not likely caused by population admixture or population substructure, because subjects in all cohorts are of European ancestry, and we adjusted for the genetic ancestry components in our study.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The large number of replication cohorts and samples reduced the chance of false-positive findings.
0	NA	NA	rs1999930	DISCUSS	The effect sizes of both rs1999930 and rs4711751 in the replication cohorts are smaller than the effect sizes estimated in the TMMG analysis.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The larger effect size observed in the discovery cohort (TMMG) could be due to a 'winner's curse' phenomenon where association is often exaggerated relative to the estimated effect in follow-up studies
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	For this study, we utilized the generally accepted genome-wide level of significance (P < 5 x 10-8) as our threshold for association.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, that threshold assumes a multiple hypothesis testing burden of ~1 000 000 independent SNPs.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Indeed, in our study, since we used the 1000 Genomes Project imputation data, there were many more individual SNPs tested.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, many of those SNPs are highly inter-correlated.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	To our knowledge, there are no empirical studies that address levels of genome-wide significance for the 1000 Genomes Project-derived data
0	AMD	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our genetic risk score model provides a framework for future research, and the clinical utility of genetic risk profiling of advanced AMD needs to be further evaluated in independent samples.
0	AMD	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Compared with other complex diseases, the associated risk variants for advanced AMD are more informative in terms of predicting risk of disease.
0	AMD	NA	NA	DISCUSS	As this prediction model only included genetic risk factors, we expect an improvement of the performance of advanced AMD risk assessment with additional environmental and demographic factors in prospective studies as in our previous calculations

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The TMMG data set genotyped by AFFY 6.0 (644 413 SNPs passing quality control checks) was imputed using the phased CEU and TSI samples (566 haplotypes) as part of Pilot 3 of the 1000 Genomes Project as a reference by BEAGLE version 3.0.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Separate imputation was performed on the TMMG data set genotyped on the ILMN 370 (329 315 SNPs passing quality control checks) using the same method.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	For the meta-analysis of GWAS, we included only imputed genotypes with imputation quality scores >0.6, where the score is defined as the ratio-of-variances (empirical/asymptotic) of each genotype.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	This score is commonly applied as a quality filter for imputed genotypes and is equivalent to the RSQR_HAT value by MACH and the information content (INFO) measure by PLINK.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Since the imputation accuracies are relatively low for SNPs with low MAF, we only included imputed genotypes of common variants (MAF >0.01) in the analysis.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	A consensus set of 6 036 699 high-quality SNPs from each imputed data set was analyzed by PLINK, using a generalized linear model controlling for the genotyping platform and genetic ancestry based on principal component analysis.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The imputed genotypes were coded by the genotype probabilities (dosages) for each SNP, which were given less weights in the analysis than individuals with certain genotypes coded by (0, 1, 2).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The eigenvector scores with nominal significant (P < 0.05) association with case/control status (principal components 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11 and 16) and the original genotyping platform were included as covariates in the analysis.
