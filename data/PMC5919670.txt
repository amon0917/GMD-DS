0	carcinomas of the colon	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	To identify variants associated with a breast-colorectal cancer phenotype, we analyzed genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from cases and controls that met the following criteria: cases (n = 985) were women with breast cancer who had one or more first- or second-degree relatives with colorectal cancer, men/women with colorectal cancer who had one or more first- or second-degree relatives with breast cancer, and women diagnosed with both breast and colorectal cancer.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Controls (n = 1769), were unrelated, breast and colorectal cancer-free, and age- and sex- frequency-matched to cases.
0	carcinomas of the colon	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	After imputation, 6,220,060 variants were analyzed using the discovery set and variants associated with the breast-colorectal cancer phenotype at P<5.0E-04 (n = 549, at 60 loci) were analyzed for replication (n = 293 cases and 2,103 controls)
0	carcinomas of the colon	ROBO1	rs7430339	ABSTRACT	Multiple correlated SNPs in intron 1 of the ROBO1 gene were suggestively associated with the breast-colorectal cancer phenotype in the discovery and replication data (most significant; rs7430339, Pdiscovery = 1.2E-04; rs7429100, Preplication = 2.8E-03).

0	carcinomas of the colon	ROBO1	NA	ABSTRACT	The results of this exploratory analysis did not find clear evidence for a susceptibility locus with a pleiotropic effect on hereditary breast and colorectal cancer risk, although the suggestive association of genetic variation in the region of ROBO1, a potential tumor suppressor gene, merits further investigation
0	carcinomas of the colon	NA	NA	INTRO	Population-based studies have revealed a strong clustering of breast and colorectal cancer within some families.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	"This clustering has given rise to speculation that there are ""breast-colon"" cancer susceptibility genes for which there are variants that predispose to co-occurrence of breast and colorectal cancer."
0	cancers	BRCA1	NA	INTRO	While co-occurrence of these two common cancers in some families could be due to chance, there is evidence that members of families with segregating germline mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2 and CHEK2 genes (which are associated with breast cancer) are also at moderately increased risk of colorectal cancer.
0	Lynch syndrome	MLH1	NA	INTRO	Similarly, families with germline mutations in the MLH1 or MSH2 genes responsible for Lynch syndrome, or with mutations in the LKB1/STK11 gene responsible for Peutz-Jeghers syndrome are known to cosegregate the two cancers.
0	carcinomas of the colon	NA	NA	INTRO	However, these relatively rare syndromes cannot explain all the observed familial clustering of breast and colorectal cancer
0	carcinomas of the colon	BRCA2	NA	INTRO	Daley et al., using a sib-pair analysis of a genome-wide linkage scan of 33 families with a breast-colorectal cancer phenotype, detected multiple linkage peaks, one of them in the region of BRCA2.
0	cancers	HIC1	NA	INTRO	They also detected other novel linked regions, including D17S1308 on chromosome 17p, in close proximity to the candidate gene hypermethylated in cancer 1 gene, HIC1.
0	carcinomas of the colon	NA	NA	INTRO	Two recent population based studies have also found suggestive evidence for a positive genetic correlation between colorectal and breast cancer.
0	cancers	NA	NA	INTRO	Lindstrom and colleagues quantified genetic correlation between different cancer types and found shared heritability of 0.22 for breast and colorectal cancer (P = 0.01).
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Similarly, Yu and colleagues used the vast Swedish Family-Cancer Database, to identify a modestly increased risk of breast cancer among families of probands affected with colorectal cancer, after excluding cases with a known hereditary predisposition.
0	carcinomas of the colon	NA	NA	INTRO	Further evidence to support the hypothesis that there are additional susceptibility genes is the observation that many families/persons fit our definition of a breast-colorectal cancer phenotype (clustering of breast and colorectal cancer in at least two first- or second-degree relatives in a family, or persons affected with synchronous or metachronous breast and colorectal cancers), but do not have mutations in the known breast or colorectal cancer genes.
0	cancers	NA	NA	INTRO	These families/persons, however, often exhibit features of an inherited predisposition, such as cancer diagnosis at a young age, a Mendelian inheritance pattern, and presence of multiple cancers such as both breast and colorectal cancers in the same person.
0	carcinomas of the colon	NA	NA	INTRO	Such families/persons are suggestive of yet undiscovered susceptibility genes for breast and colorectal cancers and continue to be a challenge for clinical geneticists and their patients because of the difficulty in estimating cancer risk for relatives and defining strategies for future surveillance
0	carcinomas of the colon	NA	NA	INTRO	The identification of genetic markers associated with the risk of a breast-colorectal cancer phenotype has clinical implications for prevention and screening/surveillance guidelines.
0	carcinomas of the colon	NA	NA	INTRO	Further, it could aid in identifying families/persons who are at high-risk of an inherited predisposition for breast and colorectal cancer, but do not have any of the known high-penetrance mutations.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Therefore the aim of this study was to identify novel susceptibility markers for this understudied phenotype using a genome-wide association study (GWAS) that included discovery and replication phases.
0	carcinomas of the colon	NA	NA	INTRO	We hypothesized that this phenotype is clinically distinct from known hereditary breast and colorectal cancer predisposition syndromes and that unique susceptibility genes influence genetic predisposition to a breast-colorectal cancer phenotype, putting some families and persons at increased risk of both breast and colorectal cancer

0	carcinomas of the colon	CHEK2	1100delC	DISCUSS	Subsequently, the idea of a distinct hereditary breast and colorectal cancer phenotype (HBCC) was proposed by Meijers-Heijboer and colleagues, when they found a significant association of the CHEK2 1100delC mutation with HBCC using a subset of familial breast cancer families that did not carry the BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations.
0	HBCC syndrome	CHEK2	1100delC	DISCUSS	However, a larger study did not confirm the HBCC syndrome as a separate entity linked to the CHEK2 1100delC mutation, suggesting that HBCC could be due to chance or yet undiscovered genes.
0	carcinomas of the colon	NA	NA	DISCUSS	A similar message was conveyed in a commentary by Lipton and colleagues, who suggested that other than the known clinical syndromes, many breast-colorectal cancer families probably result from chance clustering of two common cancers or through a genetic predisposition to one of the cancers and chance co-occurrence of the other.

0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Pathogenicity of the deletion was supported by familial co-segregation with disease, its rarity in public CNV databases, and in silico evidence of the deletion having a functional role due to the presence of several enhancers and a histone marker in the deleted region.
0	NA	ROBO1	NA	DISCUSS	Notably, the authors reported that direct sequencing did not reveal any pathogenic point mutations in ROBO1.

0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Unlike the present study, which used a familial clustering approach used to identify cases, other studies have applied a meta-analysis approach to large GWAS datasets to identify common genetic susceptibility variants across multiple cancers.
0	carcinomas of the colon	SH2B3	rs3184504	DISCUSS	For example, using colorectal cancer and endometrial cancer genome-wide data for ~13,000 cases unselected for age of disease onset or family history, and ~40,000 controls, Cheng and colleagues identified two novel polymorphisms, rs3184504 in the SH2B3 gene and rs12970291 near the TSHZ1 gene with evidence for a shared colorectal and endometrial cancer predisposition.
0	carcinomas of the colon	SH2B3	NA	DISCUSS	Another study by Hung and colleagues reported that the same SH2B3 SNP on chr12q24 was associated with lung, colorectal and breast cancer.
0	carcinomas of the colon	NA	rs3184504	DISCUSS	In our study, however, we did not find an association of rs3184504 or any other variant in the chr12q24 region, with the breast-colorectal cancer phenotype.
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Furthermore, a recent comprehensive analysis of pleiotropic associations across five cancers using 61,851 cases and 61,850 controls did not find any evidence of pleiotropy across breast and colorectal cancer, which suggests that these two cancers may not have a common genetic susceptibility mechanism
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The strengths of the present study include using an agnostic approach to identify genetic susceptibility loci, and its enrichment for genetic susceptibility through the incorporation of early cancer onset (for breast cancer) and family history to define the breast-colorectal cancer phenotype.
0	carcinomas of the colon	BRCA1	NA	DISCUSS	Furthermore, any breast-colorectal GWAS signal was less likely to be due to syndromic cases since all cases carrying BRCA1 or BRCA2 or known colorectal cancer susceptibility gene mutations were excluded from the GWAS.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Despite this, our study could have had limited statistical power to detect alleles with small true effect sizes especially if they are rare.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our study was powered to detect risk alleles with a frequency greater than 10% and a per-allele odds ratio of 1.7.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Although this detectable odds ratio is high for a GWAS, we reasoned that because the cases had a family history, the frequency of the risk allele could be higher than it would be for unselected cases.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Study power could also have been reduced because data were from different GWAS platforms, however, imputation of genetic variants after merging datasets allowed us to maximize genetic markers for our analyses.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Another potential limitation was that the breast cancer cases being younger had less time to be diagnosed with CRC and similarly, the relatives had fewer person-years at risk for CRC, than cases that had incident CRC and were older.
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Furthermore, although the cases were identified based on family history, the inclusion criteria regarding the number of relatives affected or case subjects' age at cancer onset were not stringent.
0	carcinomas of the colon	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This is in contrast to the HBCC criteria suggested by Naseem and colleagues, which included age of colorectal or breast cancer onset <50 years as a defining feature for the affected or relative.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We used the relaxed criteria to obtain a larger sample size and increase the power to detect an association, as this was an exploratory analysis, however power may be reduced due to smaller effect sizes.
0	carcinomas of the colon	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Future studies of affected families with stronger clustering of breast and colorectal cancer, might reveal a specific genetic signal.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	There is also the possibility of recall bias in the capture of family history between cases and controls, however, if the controls had unreported breast or colorectal cancer-affected first- or second-degree relatives, it may lead to type 2 (false-negatives) rather than type 1 error.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Finally, the study was limited by the lack of availability of a large dataset for replication.
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	While many thousands of people have been genotyped in the GWASs, these studies provide only limited phenotype data, and most notably, lack data on cancer family history.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Lack of replication could also be because the replication data did not closely resemble the discovery data due to the inclusion of only women with a higher mean age in the replication series, in contrast to the discovery data which included both men and women who were relatively younger
0	carcinomas of the colon	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This analysis, aimed at elucidating genes/regions associated with a pleiotropic effect for breast and colorectal cancer risk, did not show a clear susceptibility locus for this phenotype.
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This raises the possibility that aggregation of these cancers within families may be due to chance co-occurrence of two common cancers.
0	carcinomas of the colon	ROBO1	NA	DISCUSS	However, since germline variation in the region of ROBO1 was suggestive of an association with breast-colorectal cancer risk, and given mounting evidence for the role of ROBO1 as a tumor suppressor gene, further investigation of this association may be warranted
