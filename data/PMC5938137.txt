0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia and typically occurs after age 65 years.
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	INTRO	It is highly heritable, but the known genetic risk factors (currently numbering more than 25 loci including APOE) account for no more than 50% of the heritability of the disorder.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	However, genetic association findings based on AD risk do not explain the whole genetic architecture of AD because the mechanistic complexity underlying AD is not captured entirely by disease status, especially in preclinical stages.
0	memory impairment	beta-amyloid (Abeta)	NA	INTRO	To overcome this limitation and understand preclinical stages of AD, researchers have examined the genetic underpinnings of AD-related endophenotypes including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of beta amyloid peptide (Abeta42) and tau proteins, structural brain changes quantified by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and neuropsychological test measures of cognitive functioning, including memory loss.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Genome-wide association (GWA) studies for AD-related endophenotypes have identified novel loci in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study which enrolled appreciable numbers of subjects across three stages: AD dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and normal cognitive functioning (CN).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Previous ADNI studies indicated the importance of delineating different stages of subjects.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	We hypothesized that some genes may contribute to AD-related processes specifically during stages prior to AD dementia onset.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Genes and pathways that are strongly associated with AD-related endophenotypes in early disease stages may be promising targets for developing AD biomarkers and preventive medicines.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	To test this hypothesis, we conducted GWA analyses for AD-related endophenotypes in the ADNI sample stratified by stage.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Here, we focused on the association tests in the CN and MCI subgroups because we were interested in identifying genes that may contribute to AD-related processes prior to AD dementia onset
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	GWA and phenotype data for ADNI participants were downloaded from a public-access database (http://www.loni.usc.edu).

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Previously suggested AD-related endophenotypes including CSF biomarkers, MRI brain imaging measures and episodic memory tests were selected for GWA analyses in this study.
0	NA	tau	NA	METHODS	CSF biomarkers of Abeta42, total tau (t-Tau), and phosphorylated tau (p-Tau), brain MRI measure for hippocampal volume (HPV), and scores for logical memory immediate (LMiT) and delayed (LMdT) recall tests which were all measured at baseline were analyzed in this study.

0	NA	MTUS1	NA	METHODS	A significance threshold to correct for the number of eQTL analysis tests was applied which in this case was P=0.025 since only two genes (C14orf40 and MTUS1) were tested
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The top-ranked genes at or near (< 50kb) loci that achieved suggestive significance (P<10-6) in GWA tests of any trait in CN or MCI subjects or in the total sample were further evaluated for gene co-expression networks.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We built gene co-expression networks in the EBB HIPP RNA-Seq data (41,249 transcripts) by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), an approach which defines modules (or subsets) of genes that are highly co-expressed (or co-regulated).

0	NA	GLIS1	rs185031519	DISCUSS	For example, the association of rs185031519 near GLIS1 CSF Abeta42 (P=2.1x10-8) in the prior study was nominally significant in the CN group (P=8.3x10-3) in our study.
0	NA	SRRM4	NA	DISCUSS	Several of our most significant findings (including SRRM4, MTUS1, and GRIN2B) are consistent with results of other studies of AD-related endophenotypes (Supplementary Table 10)
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our findings may provide important insights about the sequence of processes leading to AD.
0	NA	SRRM4	NA	DISCUSS	The SWS associations in CN subjects (SRRM4 with t-Tau and MTUS1 with HPV) implicate neuronal signaling, development and loss, but with the exception of APOE, they do not involve Abeta processing in the asymptomatic stage of AD.
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	DISCUSS	It is noteworthy that the APOE E4 allele was not associated with the CSF Tau biomarkers and other endophenotypes in cognitively normal subjects.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The variants associated with CSF biomarkers and HPV could also be interpreted to be markers of cognitive reserve/resilience because they predict the extent of AD pathology in cognitively normal persons, but not in MCI or AD subjects.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	There is extensive evidence supporting the cognitive reserve hypothesis in AD.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Also, the variants identified for memory performance and HPV in cognitively normal individuals could be markers of inherent memory function and hippocampal volume, completely independent of AD
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our study has several limitations.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	First, the sample sizes for analyses of all traits in each clinical group, especially AD cases, were relatively small.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Thus, we had low power to identify variants having small effects.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In addition, it is possible that our top findings are false positives.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, the significant SNPs were supported by evidence in both constituent datasets (ADNI-1 and -GO/2) and from expression data analysis.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Second, in the transcriptomic analyses we did not consider differences in cellular composition between AD and control brain tissue.
0	neuronal loss	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Therefore, our results may have resulted from the excessive neuronal death in brains from AD subjects compared to controls.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, this concern would not impact our finding of increased MTSU1 expression in AD brains.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Third, the two expression datasets generated using different platforms (RNA-seq versus microarray) from different brain regions (HIPP versus CER/DLPFC/VCX) limit direct comparisons between these datasets.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Finally, it is necessary to repeat analyses in independent samples to confirm our findings and increase power to elevate the significance of true associations which did not attain study-wide significance
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In summary, we identified novel genes associated with AD-related endophenotypes in cognitively normal and MCI subjects.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	These genes had not been previously identified with AD risk and most of them are involved in neuronal development and signaling.
0	cognitive defects	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our findings suggest that genes influencing AD-related processes in individuals with normal cognition or with mild cognitive impairment may differ from those influencing these processes in individuals with AD dementia, but regulated together in the transcription level
