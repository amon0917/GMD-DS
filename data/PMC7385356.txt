0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Susceptible genetic factors, as well as various clinical risk factors, have been studied to identify high-risk patients before anthracycline administration.
0	NA	POR	NA	DISCUSS	Previous studies have revealed that genes related to the generation of excess reactive oxygen species (encoded by POR, NCF4, RAC2, and CYBA), intracellular accumulation of toxic metabolites (encoded by CBR3, SLC8A3 and UGT1A6), and interaction of anthracycline with topoisomerase-2beta (encoded by RARG) were significant in the development of ACT.
0	cancers	RARG	rs2229774	DISCUSS	21 ,  22  In particular, the RARG variant (rs2229774) was found in one discovery cohort (280 European population) and 2 validation cohorts (96 European and 80 non-European) that collectively included more than 450 childhood cancer patients.

0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	11 ,  19 ,  20  There may be several reasons for these discrepancies, including the relatively small size of our control group, differences in ethnicity, and differences in combined chemotherapeutic regimens.
0	NA	RARG	rs2229774	DISCUSS	For example, the MAF of the RARG variant rs2229774 was 6.7% in Europeans, while this value was significantly lower (0.7%) in East Asians.
1	NA	NA	rs17530621	DISCUSS	The MAF of rs17530621 found in our study also showed a significant difference between European and Asian populations.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Such differences may have caused the lack of identification of results between studies.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	One advantage of our study, however, is that we were able to adjust for possible clinical risk factors in patients with long-term follow-up.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our study, therefore, enabled us to infer that the effect of genetic variations in the development of ACT may be diluted by the effects of various clinical risk factors
