0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	African Americans have a disproportionately high risk for developing type 2 diabetes (T2DM) with an estimated prevalence twice that observed for their European-American counterparts.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In addition to socioeconomic and behavioral risk factors, genetic factors are likely contributors to the disproportionate risk observed in this population.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have been used extensively with great success to identify common genetic variants associated with T2DM in primarily European-derived populations.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Until recently, comparable studies have been difficult to perform in African Americans due to the greater complexity of their African-derived genome compounded by recent admixture of European-derived genes.

1	NA	NA	rs7560163	DISCUSS	For example, the most significant hit from the validation analysis, rs7560163, was significantly associated with T2DM in the Validation cohorts (n = 1,149 T2DM cases and 919 controls with BMI data; P = 3.59x10-6) and remained the most interesting observation after adjusting for BMI (P = 2.83x10-6; data not shown).
0	T2DM-ESRD	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Additionally, all the case groups with T2DM (T2DM-ESRD and T2DM) had a higher proportion of females (Table 1); possibly reflecting the increased prevalence of disease in women.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Gender stratified analyses revealed seven of the ten most strongly associated loci were more significant in women (P = 0.0010-3.2E-07; Table S7) although nine of the loci remained significantly associated in men (P = 0.028-3.9E-06; Table S7).

0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This study has similar limitations to other GWAS conducted in minority populations.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Although the current study has a modest sample size for the GWAS discovery phase compared to large-scale meta-analyses in European-derived populations, power calculations (Tables S8 and S9) show that this study has greater than 80% statistical power to detect effects for common variants (MAF = 0.20) consistent with published effect sizes (OR = 1.28) for T2DM (e.g.

0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The power to detect and replicate moderate level contributions to T2DM susceptibility should increase with meta-analysis of this GWAS data and other GWAS currently being conducted in African-American populations.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In addition this study reports results from only directly genotyped SNPs.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Effective imputation of additional SNPs would undoubtedly improve coverage of the African-American genome.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	While recent imputation methods development show encouraging progress, rigorous empirical testing continues.
0	Type 2 diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	A potential bias of the current study design may be that the GWAS was conducted in an African-American population of individuals with type 2 diabetes with nephropathy however; there is no specific reason why this African-American population should differ substantially from African Americans with T2DM without ESRD.
0	NA	TCF7L2	NA	DISCUSS	For example, TCF7L2 is strongly associated in our studies of African-American T2DM-ESRD subjects.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In addition it should be noted that although every precaution was taken to account for population structure, as with any GWAS or candidate gene study, there may be residual population substructure.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The major strength of this study is the genotyping and replication in four additional populations, thus providing support for the evidence of association observed.
