0	breast cancer	ER	NA	INTRO	"The clinical benefit of the antiestrogen agent ""tamoxifen"" for the treatment of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancers is well-known."
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	It is reported that five-year tamoxifen therapy could improve the risk of its relapse for 15 years, particularly for ER-positive invasive breast cancers in premenopausal women.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	However, inter-individual differences in response to tamoxifen therapy have been reported and 30-50% of patients with adjuvant tamoxifen therapy suffer a relapse and die of the disease.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Many studies have suggested that metabolites of tamoxifen, 4-hydroxytamoxifen and 4-hydroxy-N-desmethyltamoxifen (endoxifen) are the active therapeutic moieties of tamoxifen.
0	NA	ER	NA	INTRO	These two metabolites have at least 100-fold greater affinity to ER and 30-100 greater potency in inhibiting estrogen-dependent cell growth compared with a parent compound, tamoxifen.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Inter-individual differences in the production of these active metabolites could affect variability in the response to tamoxifen.
0	NA	CYP2D6	NA	INTRO	"Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) has been reported to be a key enzyme for the production of the potent active metabolites of tamoxifen, ""4-hydroxytamoxifen"" and ""endoxifen""."
0	breast cancer	CYP2D6	NA	INTRO	Many studies reported that decreased or null-function alleles of CYP2D6 were associated with poor clinical outcome in breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen.
0	NA	CYP2D6	NA	INTRO	However, the results showing the lack of association between CYP2D6 genotypes and tamoxifen efficacy have also been reported, although these studies have been criticized for multiple issues as the cause of false-negative results.
0	breast cancer	CYP2D6	NA	INTRO	To clarify the clinical significance of CYP2D6 allele in tamoxifen therapy, we recently carried out the prospective CYP2D6-tamoxifen study and reported the positive association between CYP2D6 genotype and response to tamoxifen using Ki-67 change in breast cancer tissues after short-term preoperative tamoxifen therapy, which has been known as a promising surrogate marker for clinical response to tamoxifen
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In addition to CYP2D6-tamoxifen study, many candidate gene approaches have been carried out, however, associations of the candidate genes have not yet been sufficiently validated.

0	NA	NA	rs17198973	RESULTS	Furthermore, we gave scores of 2 and 1 to individuals homozygous and heterozygous for risk allele, respectively, and 0 to those without risk allele at rs17198973 because the additive model revealed a smallest P value at this SNP.

0	NA	NA	rs17198973	DISCUSS	The most strongly associated SNP in this study, rs17198973 (Pcombined = 5.69 x 10-6) which was identified by genome-wide imputation, is located in the region on chromosome 4q34.3, although no protein-coding gene in this region is known.
0	NA	NA	rs17198973	DISCUSS	A GWAS reported that rs17198973 was one of the variants which could be associated with height.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Although body height could be regulated by genetic and environmental factors, plasma estrogen (estradiol) level has been reported as one of the factors which could influence the body height.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The interindividual variation of estrogen level could affect the response to tamoxifen because this drug acts by competitive antagonism of estrogen at its receptor site.

0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In our GWAS, the SNPs in these candidate genes showed no or weak association with Ki-67 response after preoperative tamoxifen therapy (P = 2.12 x 10-2-9.96 x 10-1).
0	NA	ER	NA	DISCUSS	Moreover, the P values of the SNPs in the ESR1, ESR2 and PGR genes, which encode ER-alpha, ER-beta and progesterone receptor (PR), respectively, were from 4.12 x 10-2 to 9.96 x 10-1, indicating no or weak association.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The sample size used in this study might not be enough to detect significant associations of these SNPs because the effect sizes of these candidate genes were not so large according to the previous reports
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In conclusion, our prospective GWAS using 347 patients with breast cancer identified three novel candidate loci, chromosome 4q34.3, 6q12, and 10p13, which were associated with Ki-67 response after preoperative tamoxifen therapy.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Moreover, the combined analysis of the three SNP loci revealed that the predictive score based on risk genotypes was significantly associated with Ki-67 response after tamoxifen therapy.
