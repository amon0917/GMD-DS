0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in diverse populations are needed to reveal variants that are more common and/or limited to defined populations.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	We conducted a GWAS of breast cancer in women of African ancestry, with genotyping of > 1,000,000 SNPs in 3,153 African American cases and 2,831 controls, and replication testing of the top 66 associations in an additional 3,607 breast cancer cases and 11,330 controls of African ancestry.
0	NA	NA	rs4322600	ABSTRACT	Two of the 66 SNPs replicated (p < 0.05) in stage 2, which reached statistical significance levels of 10-6 and 10-5 in the stage 1 and 2 combined analysis (rs4322600 at chromosome 14q31: OR = 1.18, p = 4.3x10-6; rs10510333 at chromosome 3p26: OR = 1.15, p = 1.5x10-5).
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	These suggestive risk loci have not been identified in previous GWAS in other populations and will need to be examined in additional samples.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Identification of novel risk variants for breast cancer in women of African ancestry will demand testing of a substantially larger set of markers from stage 1 in a larger replication sample
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of breast cancer have been conducted almost exclusively in populations of European ancestry, and have firmly established associations with a number of common susceptibility loci that contribute modest effects (relative risks <= 1.3).
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	These discoveries provide support for the polygenic model of breast cancer susceptibility, as well as clues as to important biological pathways involved in the pathogenesis of breast cancer.
0	breast cancer	FGFR2	NA	INTRO	For example, the most strongly associated risk locus for breast cancer revealed through GWAS has been the region containing the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) at chromosome 10q26.
0	NA	FGFR2	NA	INTRO	FGFR2 is a member of the FGFR family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) which regulate cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis.
0	NA	RAD51L1	NA	INTRO	The risk variant on chromosome 14q24 is located in intron 12 of RAD51B which is a member of the RAD51 protein family.
0	breast cancer	RAD51	NA	INTRO	RAD51 proteins are essential for DNA repair by homologous recombination, a DNA repair pathway with an established and important role in breast cancer development.
0	NA	TERT	NA	INTRO	A more recent study, which included African American subject from the current study, revealed a risk marker at the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) locus, a protein that controls telomere length and is also implicated in oncogenesis.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Many of the risk variants identified by GWAS, however, are located in gene deserts, or near genes with roles in breast cancer etiology that are currently unknown
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	The search for additional low penetrance alleles for breast cancer in specific racial/ethnic populations has revealed additional variants that are important globally or more common and/or limited to defined populations.
0	breast cancer	ER	NA	INTRO	For example, a GWAS conducted among Chinese women identified a novel risk locus for breast cancer near the gene for the estrogen receptor (ER) on chromosome 6 which had not been revealed in previous, well-powered GWAS in populations of European ancestry.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	A GWAS of prostate cancer in men of African ancestry also identified a novel risk variant at 17q12 that is not observed in other populations.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	In search for risk variants for breast cancer that may be important to women of African ancestry, we analyzed > 1 million common SNPs in 3,153 African American breast cancer cases and 2,831 African American controls, and examined the most statistically significant associations in a second stage of 3,607 cases and 11,330 controls of African ancestry
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	METHODS	Stage 1 of the GWAS included African American participants from 9 epidemiological studies of breast cancer, comprising a total of 3,153 cases and 2,831 controls (cases/controls: The Multiethnic Cohort study (MEC), 734/1,003; The Los Angeles component of The Women's Contraceptive and Reproductive Experiences (CARE) Study, 380/224; The Women's Circle of Health Study (WCHS), 272/240; The San Francisco Bay Area Breast Cancer Study (SFBCS), 172/231; The Northern California Breast Cancer Family Registry (NC-BCFR), 440/53; The Carolina Breast Cancer Study (CBCS), 656/608; The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO) Cohort, 64/133; The Nashville Breast Health Study (NBHS), 310/186; and, The Wake Forest University Breast Cancer Study (WFBC), 125/153).
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	METHODS	Replication testing was conducted in an independent sample of 3,607 breast cancer cases and 11,330 controls from 9 additional studies of breast cancer in women of African ancestry (The Black Women's Health Study (BWHS), 826/1,167; The Women's Insights and Shared Experiences study (WISE), 174/458; NBHS/Southern Community Cohort (SCCS), 981/851; The Nigerian Breast Cancer Study (NBCS), 681/282; The Barbados National Cancer Study (BNCS), 93/244; The Racial Variability in Genotypic Determinants of Breast Cancer Risk Study (RVGBC), 151/272; The Baltimore Breast Cancer Study (BBCS), 117/111; The Chicago Cancer Prone Study (CCPS), 268/261; and, The Women's Health Initiative (WHI), 316/7,484)

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Of the 5,984 samples from these studies (3,153 cases and 2,831 controls), we attempted genotyping of 5,932, removing samples (n = 52) with DNA concentrations < 20 ng/ul.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Following genotyping, we removed samples based on the following exclusion criteria: 1) unexpected replicates (>= 98.9% genetically identical) that we were able to confirm through discussions with study investigators (only one of each replicate was removed, n = 15); 2) unknown replicates that we were not able to confirm (pair or triplicate removed, n = 14);3) samples with call rates < 95% after a second genotyping attempt (n = 100); 4) samples with <= 5% African ancestry (n = 36) (discussed below); and 5) samples with < 15% mean heterozygosity of SNPs on the X chromosome and/or similar mean allele intensities of SNPs on the X and Y chromosomes (n = 6) as these are likely to be males

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Call rates by SNP and study are shown in Supplemental Table 3
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	In stage 1, we utilized STRUCTURE to infer percent African ancestry on an individual level.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	A total of 2,546 ancestry-informative SNPs from the Illumina array were selected based on low inter-marker correlation and ability to differentiate between samples of African and European descent.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	In evaluating the distribution of the fraction of African ancestry across the stage 1 populations, statistically significant differences (ANOVA p < 10-16) were noted (Supplemental Figure 1).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We also applied principal components analysis (PCA) to estimate axes of variation among the 5,761 individuals using the same 2,546 ancestry informative markers.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The first eigenvector accounted for 10.1% of the variation between subjects, and subsequent eigenvectors accounted for no more than 0.5%.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Using input genotypes from the HapMap populations, CEU (CEPH Utah), YRI (Yoruba), and JPT (Japanese), we determined that the first eigenvector captures clearly differentiates between Europeans (CEU) and West Africans (YRI) in the HapMap samples (Supplemental Figure 2)
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We examined the observed versus the expected distribution of the Chi-squared test statistics using a 1-degree of freedom (df) trend test, comparing genotype counts for each SNP in cases versus controls.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	All tests of statistical significance were two-sided.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	To improve coverage, we augmented the set of SNPs tested for association through imputation using MACH.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Phased haplotypes from the120 CEU and 120 YRI founders in HapMap Phase 2 were used to infer genotypes of all Phase 2 SNPs that were not available on the Illumina 1M Duo or did not pass our quality control (QC) criteria.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each SNP were estimated using unconditional logistic regression, adjusting for age, the first eigenvector and study.

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	In the replication studies, ORs and 95% CIs for each SNP were estimated using unconditional logistic regression, adjusting for age, region within the WHI and estimated genetic ancestry.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Ancestry information was available for all stage 2 studies except WISE (Supporting Information).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Overall testing of single SNP associations was conducted via meta-analyses of results from the stage 1 and stage 2 studies
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We also conducted combined GWAS and admixture-based statistical tests to assess the contribution of local ancestry on the SNP associations.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	For each subject in our analysis, we inferred local ancestry, which defines the proportion of European and African ancestry at each genotyped and imputed SNP.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	To infer local ancestry in our GWAS panel of 5,761 African American women, we applied the program HAPMIX.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	HAPMIX builds a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) using phased haplotype data that are representative of the two source populations assumed to be ancestral to the admixed (study) data.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	In this case, we provided the same HapMap dataset that was used for imputation (i.e.

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	HAPMIX reports posterior probabilities for each subject at each SNP of carrying 0, 1 and 2 copies of a European allele
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Combined GWAS and admixture-based statistical tests were conducted to make inferences about regions of the genome that explain not only case-control differences in disease risk based on SNP associations, but also risk differences based on local genetic ancestry.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We utilized the MIXSCORE program which takes as input results from a GWAS scan and an admixture scan (specifically HAPMIX output), computes several statistics that incorporate allele frequency information from both sources of evidence.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The SUM score is a 2-df Chi squared test that simultaneously tests for association (i.e.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	a case-control difference in allele frequency) and admixture evidence (i.e.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	a deviation from the genome-wide proportion of European ancestry).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The MIX score also tests for both evidence of admixture and association, but assumes the odds ratios for admixture and association are equal, which is potentially more powerful when this assumption is true since it is a 1-df test
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	RESULTS	The stage 1 analysis included 3,016 cases and 2,745 controls among African American women from 9 epidemiological studies of breast cancer.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The age of the cases and controls in stage 1 ranged from 22 to 87 years with the median ages being 55 and 58 years, respectively (Supplemental Table 1).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The analysis of the most statistically significant associations from stage 1 was conducted in 3,533 cases and 11,046 controls from an additional 9 studies.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The age of the cases and controls in stage 2 ranged from 18 to 92 years with the median ages being 50 and 53 years, respectively (Supplemental Table 2)
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We observed no evidence of inflation of the test statistic (lambda = 1.01) for the 1,043,036 genotyped and 2,067,098 imputed SNPs analyzed in stage 1, and no excess of very small p-values beyond what was expected (Figure 1).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We observed no SNP to be associated with disease status at a genome-wide level of significance (p < 5x10-8) in stage 1 (Figure 2).
0	NA	GRM7	rs7610073	RESULTS	The most statistically significant association was noted with SNP rs7610073 located in intron 2 of the gene GRM7 (metabotropic glutamate receptor 7) on chromosome 3p26 (risk allele frequency 0.64; OR per allele = 1.22; p = 7.4x10-7).
0	NA	GRM7	rs10510333	RESULTS	A second signal was also noted ~486 kb upstream of GRM7 (rs10510333: risk allele frequency = 0.18; OR per allele = 1.24; p = 8.2x10-6).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The associations with these 2 markers were independent and remained statistically significant when both were included in the same model (p-values of 8.3x10-7 and 9.3x10-6, respectively).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Shown in Table 1 are the genotyped SNPs with p-values < 10-5 in stage 1, as well as SNPs that replicated in stage 2 (discussed below)
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We selected 66 genotyped SNPs with association p-values less than 2x10-4 for replication testing in the stage 2 studies.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	None of these SNPs replicated with stage 2-wide significance of < 0.0008 (0.05/66), but 2 replicated with a p-value < 0.05 and an OR in the same direction as that observed in stage 1 (Table 1).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Combining results from stages 1 and 2, no SNP achieved genome-wide significance.
1	NA	GALC	rs4322600	RESULTS	The smallest combined p-values were noted for the two SNPs that replicated in stage 2: rs4322600 located ~100 kb upstream of the gene GALC (galactosylceramidase) on chromosome 14q31 (risk allele frequency = 0.78, OR per allele = 1.18, p = 4.3x10-6) and rs10510333 located ~486 kb upstream of GRM7 on chromosome 3p26 (risk allele frequency = 0.18, OR per allele = 1.15, p = 1.5x10-5) (Table 1).
0	NA	ER	rs10510333	RESULTS	We found no strong statistical evidence that the associations with these two loci differ by ER status (p-values for heterogeneity in case-only testing: rs10510333: p = 0.67; rs4322600: p = 0.85
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Using the MIXSCORE program, we simultaneously tested the null hypothesis of no association and admixture at each loci defined by the 66 most significant variants identified in Stage 1.
0	NA	NA	rs7610073	RESULTS	SNP rs7610073, which had the largest MIX score of 24.5 (p = 7.5x10-7) also had the smallest p-value in the first stage (Supplemental Table 4).
0	NA	NA	rs7610073	RESULTS	"The risk allele (the ""A"" allele for rs7610073) was not strongly differentiated (60% in HapMap YRI versus 81% in HapMap CEU) and the MIX score p-value was almost identical to the p-value from our association scan."
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Association p-values were generally stronger than the SUM or MIX score, so admixture did not make a substantive contribution in joint evidence of admixture and association for these 66 SNPs, as indicated in Supplemental Table 4.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	All together, these findings seem to indicate that the associations at the most significant loci in Stage 1 are not influenced by differences in local ancestry between cases and controls, meaning that any causal variants in these regions are not appreciably differentiated in frequency between cases and controls
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Genome-wide studies of common and rare genetic variation conducted in multiple populations will be required to reveal the complete spectrum of susceptibility alleles that contribute to risk of breast cancer globally.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In a genome-wide scan of common genetic variation in > 3,000 African American cases and > 2,700 controls, followed by replication testing of the most significant associations (p < 2x10-4) in an independent set of > 3,500 cases and > 11,000 controls, we identified two suggestive associations with breast cancer risk that replicated in stage 2 at p < 0.05 [chromosome 14q31 (p = 4.3x10-6) and 3p26 (p = 1.5x10-5)]; however, these associations did not reach the standard level of genome-wide significance.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	These regions have not been highlighted in previous GWAS conducted in other racial/ethnic populations and each association requires further validation in additional studies
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Populations of African ancestry have greater genetic diversity and lower levels of LD among chromosomal loci.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Because of LD patterns and allele frequencies that differ from non-African populations, GWAS results from European or Asian populations are not always replicable in populations of African ancestry.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Fine-mapping of known breast cancer risk loci in populations of African ancestry have revealed risk-associated markers that are more relevant to African populations and contribute to modeling of genetic risk in this population.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Large GWAS in populations of African ancestry, with proper control of population structure, will be required to discover additional disease susceptibility variants that better define the genetic profile of breast cancer in this population
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	A strength of the present study is that it includes most existing case-control studies of breast cancer conducted in women of African ancestry.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In this 2-stage design, we had 80% statistical power to identify a common risk variant (frequency of >= 10%) that conveys a risk per allele of 1.3 at genome-wide significance (p = 5x10-8).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Thus, we were able to rule out variants with large effects if they were among the top 0.007% in stage 1 (and thus taken to stage 2) and were adequately tagged by the common SNPs on the 1M array.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, we are likely to have missed some milder associations.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In previous GWAS of breast cancer in European ancestry populations, most risk variants eventually identified were not among the most statistically significant in stage 1 and were only revealed through testing of large numbers of SNPs in additional replication stages.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	To identify novel risk loci for breast cancer in African ancestry populations will require continued collaborative efforts and investigators willing to test larger numbers of SNPs in their respective studies
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our attempt to apply joint admixture and association mapping, using MIXSCORE, did not provide additional suggestive risk variants beyond those found using association methods alone.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This suggests that the associations observed at the most significant regions in Stage 1 are not weakened by ancestry differences between cases and controls, and thus, the biologically functional alleles are unlikely to be highly differentiated in frequency between cases and controls.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Because of the limited number of ER-negative cases in stage 1 (n = 988) and stage 2 (n = 423) the statistical power to look at subtypes with rate differences (e.g.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	ER-negative disease, more common in African American than European American women) was limited and not attempted for GWAS or admixture testing.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, in collaboration with GWAS of ER-negative breast cancer in European ancestry populations, which have substantially larger numbers of ER-negative cases, we have identified a novel locus for ER-negative breast cancer at 5p15 (TERT).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Genetic variation at this locus may contribute in part to the higher incidence of ER-negative disease subtypes in women of African ancestry (frequency of 0.56 in African Americans and frequency of 0.26 in Whites).
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	As for the analysis of overall breast cancer, larger studies of breast cancer in women of African ancestry will be needed to search for novel risk loci for ER-negative disease subtypes that are important for and may be limited to this population
