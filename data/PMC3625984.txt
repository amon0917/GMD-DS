0	AMD	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Relatively little is known about the interaction between genes and environment in the complex etiology of age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
0	AMD	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	This study aimed to identify novel factors associated with AMD by analyzing gene-smoking interactions in a genome-wide association study of 1207 AMD cases and 686 controls of Caucasian background with genotype data on 668,238 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) after quality control.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Participants' history of smoking at least 100 cigarettes lifetime was determined by a self-administered questionnaire.
0	AMD	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	SNP associations modeled the effect of the minor allele additively on AMD using logistic regression, with adjustment for age, sex, and ever/never smoking.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Joint effects of SNPs and smoking were examined comparing a null model containing only age, sex, and smoking against an extended model including genotypic and interaction terms.
1	AMD	CFH	NA	ABSTRACT	Genome-wide significant main effects were detected at three known AMD loci: CFH (P=7.51x10-30), ARMS2 (P=1.94x10-23), and RDBP/CFB/C2 (P=4.37x10-10), while joint effects analysis revealed three genomic regions with P<10-5.
0	AMD	SERPINB8	rs17073641	ABSTRACT	Analyses stratified by smoking found genetic associations largely restricted to non-smokers, with one notable exception: the chromosome 18q22.1 intergenic SNP rs17073641 (between SERPINB8 and CDH7), more strongly associated in non-smokers (OR=0.57, P=2.73x10-5), with an inverse association among smokers (OR=1.42, P=0.00228), suggesting that smoking modifies the effect of some genetic polymorphisms on AMD risk
0	AMD	NA	NA	INTRO	Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of severe visual impairment in older adults in the developed world.
0	AMD	NA	NA	INTRO	AMD is responsible for more than half of all blindness in the US, with approximately 7.3 million persons aged 40 years and older diagnosed with intermediate AMD and an additional 1.75 million people affected with advanced AMD.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	With an aging population, the worldwide prevalence of this debilitating condition is expected to increase more than 50% by 2020.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Multiple inherited and environmental exposures contribute to risk and severity of this common disease.
0	AMD	NA	NA	INTRO	The strongest risk factor associated with AMD development is age.
0	AMD	NA	NA	INTRO	The incidences of various features of AMD also increase with age, including early changes such as multiple small drusen, intermediate features like large drusen and pigmentary changes, and advanced findings of choroidal neovascularization and geographic atrophy.
0	hypertension	NA	NA	INTRO	Other risk factors for the condition include female gender and Northern European Causasian background, as well as modifiable factors including antioxidant intake, hypertension, and obesity.
0	AMD	NA	NA	INTRO	Cigarette smoking is the strongest modifiable risk factor for AMD, contributing to a two-fold increase in risk
1	AMD	CFH	NA	INTRO	Among non-modifiable risk factors for AMD, several genes have been identified through linkage and association studies, amongst which the most replicated are CFH (encoding complement factor H), CFB/C2 (encoding complement factor B and complement component 2, respectively), ARMS2 (age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2)/HTRA1 (encoding HtrA serine peptidase 1), C3 (encoding complement component 3), and APOE (encoding apolipoprotein E).
0	AMD	LIPC	NA	INTRO	Two recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of AMD implicated variation in several new candidate genes for AMD including LIPC (hepatic lipase), ABCA1 (ATP-binding cassette, subfamily A member 1) and TIMP3 (encoding metalloproteinase inhibitor 3), among others
0	AMD	NA	NA	INTRO	The role of smoking as a modifier of genetic risk for AMD has been evaluated in candidate gene studies of several of these major AMD loci.
1	AMD	apolipoprotein E	NA	INTRO	Our group previously identified suggestive evidence for interaction of smoking history with the APOE epsilon2 allele on AMD risk, and we also reported synergistic interaction between cigarette smoking and genotypic variants in ARMS2.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Other groups observed contradictory evidence for some of these interactions.
0	NA	NOS2A	NA	INTRO	More recently, a significant interaction with smoking was reported for AMD-associated variants in the NOS2A gene
1	Inflammation Laboratory's JDRF	NA	NA	INTRO	While genetic studies like those mentioned here have clearly implicated roles for genes in the complement pathway and chronic inflammation, much of AMD's genetic contribution, with heritability (h2) estimated to be between 45% and 71%, remains unknown and recent work has indicated that ARMS2/HTRA1 and complement pathway genes explain at most 50% of the disease heritability.
1	AMD	ARMS2	NA	INTRO	Furthermore, while some pathological effects of smoking on AMD progression are known, it is unclear how this powerful risk factor may alter the role of genes outside of the known AMD risk genes in the complement pathway and ARMS2.
0	AMD	NA	NA	INTRO	With the powerful effect of smoking on AMD risk, it is also unclear if the association of genetic variants with disease may be masked due to undetected gene-smoking interactions in genome-wide association studies.
0	AMD	NA	NA	INTRO	For these reasons, we performed a genome-wide association study, analyzing data on 668,238 SNPs from 1207 persons with AMD and 686 persons free of disease.
0	AMD	NA	NA	INTRO	With the availability of detailed smoking history data, we also examined whether smoking history modified the effects of genomic variants on AMD risk, and performed secondary analyses to examine whether any genetic variants newly demonstrate association when accounting for smoking history

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Samples with efficiency less than 0.95 were dropped from the analysis (N=58).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Differences between reported gender and gender estimated from reporting of heterozygous genotypes of X-linked SNPs resulted in 13 inconsistent samples being dropped from the analysis.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We used the program Graphical Representation of Relatedness (GRR) to test relatedness between samples, and 22 samples with proportion of alleles shared IBD  > 0.40 were dropped from the analysis
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We examined the case-control sample for evidence of population substructure by identifying a set of 10,000 SNPs with minor allele frequency (MAF)>0.25, selected for minimal between-SNP linkage disequilibrium (r2<0.20) and spread evenly across the autosomal chromosomes.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We analyzed this subset of SNPs via principal components analysis in the program EIGENSTRAT, generating principal component loadings for each genotyped individual, removing outliers (N=11) identified by using the top ten principal components over five iterations with a threshold of six standard deviations.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The top three principal components were examined and found to have small loadings, suggesting the general absence of major population substructure, and thus population substructure was not adjusted for in association analyses
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	After exclusions, we analyzed data on 1893 Northern European Caucasian participants, including 1207 cases (individuals graded 3, 4, or 5) and 686 controls (individuals graded 1 or 2)

0	AMD	NA	NA	METHODS	The total number of individuals with smoking history and other environmental risk information (1,419 Northern European Caucasian participants) was included in the analysis of SNP/smoking interaction (894 AMD cases [grades 3, 4 and 5] and 525 unrelated controls [grades 1 and 2]).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	A full description of the participants by clinical findings and smoking status is presented in Table 1
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	To provide more comprehensive coverage of the genome, genome-wide imputation was performed using the MaCH 1.0.16 software package with HapMap phase 2 (release 22) CEPH Utah pedigree (CEU) reference haplotypes and genotype data passing quality control.

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	All analyses were performed using the PLINK software package.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Quantile-quantile plots (Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	4) of the associations suggest the absence of systematic bias in the tests of association, with the primary analysis demonstrating a genomic inflation factor of lambda=1.07
0	AMD	NA	NA	METHODS	Using covariate data on smoking history, we performed a genome-wide investigation of SNP-smoking interaction in AMD risk using logistic regression models including terms for SNP-specific effects modeled additively, ever/never smoking, and a SNP-smoking interaction term.
0	NA	p<10-5	NA	METHODS	Statistical interactions were identified for follow-up if a two degree-of-freedom (2df) test of association, comparing a null model without SNP main effect and SNP-smoking interaction to an extended model including both terms, generated P<10-5.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	This approach has more statistical power to identify gene-environment interactions than marginal tests of independence of gene and environment in cases only or examining the statistical significance of interaction terms directly.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Furthermore, examining genome-wide association results from the 2df test of interaction could identify potential novel genetic associations that may not have been previously observed due to confounding or mediating effects of smoking
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We also conducted stratified analyses by dividing our dataset into ever smokers (548 cases and 278 controls) and never smokers (346 cases and 247 controls).

0	NA	p<10-5	NA	METHODS	To provide replication for the associations observed in primary data analysis of the discovery dataset, data from genome-wide genotyping and, for a subset of SNPs, individual SNPs genotyped via Taqman assay were examined in an independent set of 122 cases and 86 controls on the 79 SNPs with associations of P<10-5 from discovery analyses.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Replication analyses were performed in a manner analogous to the approach described for discovery analyses.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Combined association analyses pooled data from both discovery and replication case-control datasets to strengthen statistical power to detect associations through increased sample size, and as with the replication data, were performed in a manner analogous to discovery analyse
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Table 1 depicts the demographic characteristics of the cases and controls examined in discovery analyses.
0	AMD	NA	NA	RESULTS	We examined 1207 AMD cases (those with Grades 3, 4, or 5), with an average age of 77.6 years at examination (standard deviation (SD): +- 7.9 years), and 686 controls (those with Grades 1 or 2) with a significantly lower average age at examination of 70.9 years (SD: +- 7.8 years) (P=2.5x10-67 from tdf=2).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Cases were more frequently female (63.5%) than controls (55.4%) (P=0.002).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The frequency of smokers was higher among cases (N=548; 61.3%) than controls (N=278; 53.0%) (P=0.002).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The significant differences in age, sex, and smoking history between the two groups suggested that these might be important confounders in the genetic associations, and therefore both age and sex were included as covariates in primary analysis with subsequent analyses also incorporating ever/never smoking
0	AMD	p<10-5	NA	RESULTS	Examining associations of genomic variants with AMD, 67 SNPs distributed over eight genomic regions demonstrated associations with P<10-5 (Table 2; Figure 1; Supplementary Table 2).
1	AMD	CFH	rs1831282	RESULTS	Similar to the prior published GWAS of AMD, the strongest associations fell in the chromosome 1q31.3 gene CFH (encoding complement factor H) at rs1831282 (OR (95% CI): 0.40 (0.35, 0.47), P=7.51x10-30) and in the ARMS2 (age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2) locus at rs10490924 (OR (95% CI): 2.25 (1.92, 2.63), P=1.94x10-23) on chromosome 10q26.13.
1	NA	CFH	rs1061170	RESULTS	While the most commonly associated variant in CFH, Y402H (rs1061170) was not genotyped as part of the GWAS, the strongest signal in CFH at rs1831282 is at a SNP in high LD (D'=0.98; r2= 0.90) with the Y402H SNP in HapMap Caucasian (CEU) samples of Northern European Caucasian background.
1	NA	CFH	rs800292	RESULTS	Multiple variants in both genes demonstrated associations with genome-wide statistical significance (P<5.00x10-8), including several potentially functional SNPs, such as the nonsynonymous coding SNPs rs800292 (V62I) in CFH (P=7.37x10-14) and rs10490924 (A69S) in ARMS2 (P=1.94x10-23).
1	AMD	RDBP	rs522162	RESULTS	Variation on chromosome 6p21.32 near loci RDBP and CFB/C2 was also strongly associated with AMD, with the strongest association at rs522162 (OR (95% CI): 0.41 (0.31, 0.54), P=4.37x10-10).
0	AMD	CFB	rs641153	RESULTS	This SNP was in high LD (D'=1.00; r2=1.00) with the CFB coding variant R32Q (rs641153), associated strongly with AMD in previous studies but not genotyped in this study.
0	NA	p<10-5	NA	RESULTS	In addition to these genome-wide significant associations, several regions demonstrated modestly significant evidence of association (P<10-5), including chromosomes 2p23.3, 2q37.3, 4q32.2, 15q26.2, and 17q22
1	NA	ARMS2	NA	RESULTS	Examining replication data on 122 cases and 86 controls passing quality control confirmed associations at the ARMS2, CFH, and RDBP/CFB/C2 loci, as well as further strengthening the association observed for the associated variant at 17q22 (P=1.73x10-6), however neither the pattern nor strength of associations with borderline statistical significance at other loci (2p23.3, 4q32.2, 15q26.2, and 2q37.3) appeared to replicate in this smaller dataset.
1	NA	HTRA1	rs2253755	RESULTS	Several SNPs in genes proximal to strongly associated genes, like rs2253755 in HTRA1 near ARMS2 and rs406936 in SKIV2L near RDBP/CFB/ C2 (Supplementary Table 2), demonstrated much stronger associations with the inclusion of replication data (rs2253755, discovery P=1.45x10-6   combined P=3.13x10-9; rs406936, discovery P=8.01x10-6   combined P=6.80x10-7).
1	NA	SKIV2L	NA	RESULTS	This is potentially the result of the clustering of multiple AMD-related genes in close proximity, in particular for SKIV2L, for which evidence exists that it is associated with AMD independently of RDBP/CFB/C2 (Kopplin et al., 2010)
0	AMD	NA	NA	RESULTS	To minimize potential effects of misclassification by affection status, we performed tests of association comparing a subset of cases with neovascular AMD (Grade 5) to controls with little or no evidence of AMD or drusen development (Grade 1) (Table 3; Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	2; Supplementary Table 2).
1	NA	p<10-5	rs424535	RESULTS	While several regions demonstrated associations of P<10-5, only those of variants in CFH and ARMS2 attained genome-wide statistical significance (rs424535 in CFH, P=6.54x10-11; rs10490924 in ARMS2, P=9.15x10-26)
1	NA	ARMS2	rs10490924	RESULTS	We also examined three models of associations conditioning on the genotypic effects of the most significantly associated variants in ARMS2 and CFH, rs10490924 and rs1831282 respectively, with two models conditioning on each variant individually and one model conditioning on both (Table 4).
1	NA	ARMS2	rs10490924	RESULTS	Among associations conditioning on rs10490924 in ARMS2 with P<10-5, we observed several new associations with P<10-5 at variants on chromosomes Xq27.1, 11p13, and 12q15, with associations of CFH variants also remaining highly significant (rs403846, OR (95% CI): 0.40 (0.34, 0.47); P=1.09x10-28).
1	NA	CFH	rs1831282	RESULTS	Conditioning on rs1831282 in CFH, ARMS2 variation maintained highly significant association, with novel associations in chromosomes 11q22.1 and 14q21.3 without previous association at P<10-5.
1	NA	ARMS2	NA	RESULTS	Conditioning on both the ARMS2 and CFH variants, only associations in the RDBP/CFB/C2 region maintained genome-wide statistical significance, with variants in few other regions demonstrating associations with P<10-5.
1	AMD	C3	NA	RESULTS	Associations near other AMD candidate loci including C3, APOE, LIPC, ABCA1, and TIMP3 were largely unchanged after conditioning on either the ARMS2 or CFH variants investigated (data not shown)
0	AMD	NA	NA	RESULTS	We investigated differences in exposure to the single strongest modifiable environmental risk factor for AMD, cigarette smoking, to determine if smoking may modify genetic susceptibility to AMD.
0	NA	p<10-5	NA	RESULTS	Overall, six genomic regions demonstrated evidence of both strong main effects and interaction with P<10-5 from the 2df joint tests (Table 5; Fig.
1	NA	CFH	NA	RESULTS	3; Supplementary Table 3), including the regions containing genes CFH (P=2.00x10-23 from 2df test), RDBP/CFB/C2 (P=3.61x10-8 from 2df test), and ARMS2 (P=1.55x10-17 from 2df test).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Parsing the terms contributing to associations in these three genes, the SNP main effects were of strong genome-wide statistical significance (P<5.00x10-8), however no nominally significant interactive effects were observed (P<0.05)
0	NA	p<10-5	NA	RESULTS	Several other genomic regions report P<10-5 for the 2df joint tests, including variants on chromosomes 5p15.2, 6q16.2, and 18q22.1 (Table 5).
0	NA	NA	rs17073641	RESULTS	The chromosome 18q22.1 variant, rs17073641, with P=7.00x10-7 from the 2-df joint test, is notable for both a strong main effect (P=1.52x10-5) and strong interactive effect (P=1.19x10-7).
0	AMD	NA	NA	RESULTS	Stratified analyses of this SNP reveal an increased risk of AMD among ever smokers (OR (95% CI) = 1.42 (1.13, 1.77), P=0.00228) for each copy of the C allele at this locus (MAF = 0.45), but a strong protective effect of this allele among never smokers (OR (95% CI) = 0.57 (0.44, 0.74), P=2.73x10-5)
1	AMD	HTRA1	NA	RESULTS	As several loci including HTRA1 and NOS2 have demonstrated evidence for gene-smoking interactions in AMD in previous studies, we examined effect modification of variants in and around (10kb upstream or downstream) these genes.
0	NA	NOS2A	rs11657662	RESULTS	Of the three SNPs in/near NOS2 observed, rs11657662, rs9898084, and rs9895785, none of these demonstrated nominally statistically significant main effects (P<0.05) or interactive effects (2df P<0.05 or P for interaction <0.05).
1	AMD	HTRA1	rs2672587	RESULTS	In HTRA1, which is located 5kb downstream of ARMS2, several variants with strong overall genetic effect on AMD (2df P<0.05) were observed at the 5' end of the gene near ARMS2, however only one variant (rs2672587; 2df P=3.06x10-13) demonstrated statistical significance for the joint (2df) test of interaction
0	NA	p<10-5	NA	RESULTS	In analyses stratified by ever/never smoking status, association findings for SNPs with P<10-5 from the 2-df test differed greatly between strata (Table 5; Supplementary Table 4).
1	AMD	CFH	NA	RESULTS	Results for ever smokers resembled the associations reported for unstratified analyses, with the most statistically significant associations being observed in known AMD genes (CFH: OR (95% CI) = 0.38 (0.30, 0.48), P=7.7x10-16; ARMS2: 2.51 (1.97, 3.21), P=1.06x10-13; RDBP/CFB/C2: 0.34 (0.22, 0.52), P=7.91x10-7).
0	NA	GLIS3	NA	RESULTS	One gene with suggestive association that was specific to ever smokers, GLIS3 (OR (95% CI) = 0.60 (0.48, 0.76), P=2.31x10-5) is also known to be involved in eye development.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	In addition, several novel loci were implicated in the analysis of individuals who had never smoked, suggesting different underlying genetic associations for nonsmokers.
0	NA	CFH	rs572515	RESULTS	The only genome-wide significant association observed among nonsmokers was at CFH SNP rs572515 (OR (95% CI) = 0.37 (0.28, 0.50), P=1.74x10-11), with similar size and directionality of effect as observed in unstratified analyses of that SNP (OR (95% CI) = 0.42 (0.36, 0.49), P=7.77x10-28).
1	NA	ARMS2	NA	RESULTS	ARMS2 was only suggestively associated in this stratum (OR (95% CI) = 1.87 (1.42, 2.47), P=7.64x10-6) (unstratified association: (OR (95% CI) = 2.25 (1.92, 2.63), P=1.94x10-23)
0	NA	p<10-5	rs4619440	RESULTS	Examining a subset of loci that demonstrated modest evidence for interaction (P for interaction < 10-4) but did not have significant main and interactive effects (P<10-5) in the 2-df test, three strong association signals among non-smokers were in or near genes known to be involved in retinal cell function (intergenic SNP rs4619440, between RGS9 and AXIN2: OR (95% CI) = 0.28 (0.16, 0.49), P=7.59x10-6; EYS1: 0.51 (0.38, 0.68), P=6.33x10-6; DGKI: 0.55 (0.41, 0.72), P=2.41x10-5)
1	AMD	ARMS2	NA	DISCUSS	Our data confirms the association with AMD of variation at three loci, namely ARMS2, CFH, and RDBP/CFB/C2, and observed strong associations in several novel genomic regions, including chromosomes 15q26.2 and 17q22.
1	NA	ARMS2	NA	DISCUSS	Furthermore, incorporating a set of replication cases and controls strengthened associations at ARMS2, CFH, RDBP/CFB/C2, and the novel signal at 17q22.
0	myopia	MYP5	NA	DISCUSS	The chromosome 17q22 region is notable as several previous studies have implicated this region in disorders of vision; it is near a strong linkage signal on 17q21-17q22 to high myopia (hypothetical locus named myopia 5 [high grade, autosomal dominant] (MYP5)).
0	myopia	COL1A1	NA	DISCUSS	A chromosome 17q21.33 gene encodes collagen type 1 alpha 1 (COL1A1), an extracellular matrix gene which is expressed in the scleral wall and also implicated in myopia, though this gene is at a considerable distance from the association signal (approximately 4Mb downstream).
0	myopia	NA	NA	DISCUSS	While historically myopia has not shown association with AMD, myopic degeneration has some similarities to AMD including loss of central vision due to photoreceptor cell degeneration; variation in this region may contribute to common early pathologic features of both myopia and AMD and thus subsequently increase risk of either outcome
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Notably, this study is the first to present results from a genome-wide scan for joint effects of genomic variation and history of ever/never smoking.
1	NA	ARMS2	NA	DISCUSS	Though none of the associations attained statistical significance, our analysis identified several novel regions with potential gene-smoking interaction and support gene-smoking interactions at the major risk loci ARMS2 and CFH, each of which were initially described in prior candidate gene studies.
0	AMD	CFH	rs1061170	DISCUSS	A study of 103 discordant sibling pairs demonstrated that a smoking history of 10 pack-years or more increased risk of neovascular AMD 144-fold among those carrying the CC genotype at the Y402H (rs1061170) polymorphism of CFH relative to those with the CT or TT genotype.
0	AMD	NA	rs1061170	DISCUSS	A study looking at ever/never smoking and Y402H similarly observed a positive interaction between the two in AMD risk.
1	NA	NA	rs572515	DISCUSS	In the present study, we observed a modest interaction of ever/never smoking with rs572515 which is in high LD (D'=0.98, r2=0.81) with the common Y402H-proxy SNP, rs1831282.
1	NA	ARMS2	rs10490924	DISCUSS	Likewise, we observed modest evidence for a gene-smoking interaction at ARMS2, specifically the functional SNP rs10490924 (A69S), providing additional confirmation for this interaction which we previously described in a subset of this sample
1	NA	NA	rs522162	DISCUSS	Among novel gene-smoking interactions detected is the interaction of rs522162 in the RDBP/CFB/C2 region with ever/never smoking, for which the minor allele demonstrated a stronger protective association among smokers (OR (95% CI) = 0.34 (0.22, 0.52), P=7.91x10-7) than among non-smokers (OR (95% CI) =0.46 (0.28, 0.75), P=0.00199).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We also identified variants in two regions, 6q16.2 and 18q22.1, with potential AMD-smoking interactions, the latter of which demonstrated a notable risk-increasing effect among ever smokers and protective effect among never smokers.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We also observed interesting new evidence of a strong association on chromosome 5p15.2 among only individuals who smoked
1	choriocapillaris	RDBP	NA	DISCUSS	Although the strongest and most consistent association on chromosome 6 lies in the 6p21.32 region near the RDBP and CFB/C2 loci, several lines of evidence suggest that loci near 6q16.2 approximately 66 Mb away may also contribute to macular disease.
0	North Carolina Prostate Cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	A linkage study of North Carolina macular dystrophy identified a locus on chromosome 6q16 that contributed to an autosomal-dominant form of macular degeneration.
0	choriocapillaris	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Furthermore, studies of different forms of rare macular dystrophy have also identified linkage of Stargardt-like dominant progressive macular dystrophy to the 6q14-6q16 region, as have several studies on rare familial forms of macular degeneration and drusen development.
0	NA	MCHR2	rs4840097	DISCUSS	Furthermore, the associated variants on 6q16.2 including rs4840097 are near the MCHR2 gene (melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 2), which is expressed in brain and is part of the rhodopsin family of genes involved in photoreceptor development
0	AMD	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Similarly, variation near chromosome 18q22.1 contributes to several disorders of vision that may share some common pathological features with AMD.
0	open angle glaucoma	NA	NA	DISCUSS	One study identified variation in 18q22 that may contribute to pigmentary glaucoma; a more recent case study found that a deletion in 18q22.1 may have contributed to the occurrence of pigment dispersion syndrome, which can lead to pigmentary glaucoma if untreated.
0	NA	CDH7	NA	DISCUSS	CDH7 also lies in 18q22 and encodes cadherin 7, which is most highly expressed in the retina, particularly in the ganglion cell and amacrine layers
0	AMD	NA	rs553169	DISCUSS	Potentially most interesting among our novel findings is the observed association of a chromosome 5p15.2 variant rs553169 with AMD among smokers (P=1.88x10-7) but not among nonsmokers (P=0.175).
0	NA	SEMA5A	NA	DISCUSS	This SNP is proximal to SEMA5A, encoding Semaphorin 5A, which inhibits axonal growth by retinal ganglion cells.
0	North Carolina Prostate Cancer	MCDR3	NA	DISCUSS	This region was also mapped as the strongest linkage signal (MCDR3, LOD=3.61) in a study examining a well-documented four-generation English family with a phenotype with features similar to North Carolina Macular Dystrophy, including retinal pigment epithelium abnormalities and the formation of drusen-like deposits.
0	AMD	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Further examination of associations in this region among smokers may identify a susceptiblity gene for AMD for which effects may be limited to those with a history of smoking
0	AMD	NA	NA	DISCUSS	While these separate pieces of evidence suggest that chromosomes 6q16.2 and 18q22.1 may both hold vision-related loci, and 5p15.2 may hold an AMD locus with effects only among smokers, replication of these findings in datasets enriched with subjects with well-characterized smoking history data is necessary to confirm these findings
