0	chronic kidney disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Chronic kidney disease (CKD), defined by an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) lower than 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 for three or more months, is a global health concern and is associated with premature death.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	CKD has a prevalence of 15% and affects 30 million people in the US.
0	T2DM-ESRD	NA	NA	INTRO	In addition to the risk of progressing to end-stage-renal disease (ESRD), CKD is associated with significant cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Patients with an eGFR of <15 ml/min/1.73 m2, for example, have a threefold increased mortality than those with normal renal function
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	Diabetes is the most common comorbidity associated with ESRD worldwide, occurring in 44-60% of ESRD cases.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	CKD in diabetics is multifactorial and also related to hyperglycemia, hypertension, atherosclerosis, and aging.
0	T2DM-ESRD	NA	NA	INTRO	Currently there are few therapies that slow CKD progression and life-extending treatments for ESRD are restricted to dialysis and transplantation
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	There is a great need to understand the biological mechanisms that lead to CKD so that treatments that target those biological factors can be developed.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Kidney function, as measured by eGFR, is a heritable trait that has been studied in genetic association studies, and over 50 eGFR loci have been definitively identified.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	A small proportion of variance in eGFR is explained by the subtle effects of previously reported variants, and the genetic etiology of this trait is highly complex.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The inferences of what genes influence eGFR are often unclear from loci detected by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of common variants, which comprise a large proportion of known genetic determinants.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Regulatory effects may account for significant additional heritability in GWAS, and GWAS results are enriched for regulatory single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) compared with the proportion of the genome containing regulatory elements.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In recent large-scale GWAS meta-analyses of eGFR, it was shown that many significant SNPs map into tissue-specific regulatory regions, and that gene expression may mediate many of the associations between genetic variants and eGFR.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Several methods were recently developed to leverage multiple variants to perform gene-based tests of association between imputed gene expression levels and phenotypes.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	These tests are tissue-specific and provide effect estimates with interpretable direction and magnitude compared with studies that only evaluate associations between SNPs and traits
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Thus, to capitalize on our large electronic health record-based study of patients receiving care in a standardized setting and to leverage available analytical possibilities, we conduct a transethnic GWAS of eGFR in 280,722 participants of the U.S.

0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Currently universal sickle cell screening is performed prior to military ascension in the U.S. Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps, while in the U.S. Army screening is performed only in specific scenarios related to deployment and certain occupational hazards.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Similarly, in other countries' militaries, sickle cell allele carriers may be barred from diving, submarine, and aircrew service.
0	exertional rhabdomyolysis	NA	NA	DISCUSS	A recent study found that sickle cell trait was not associated with increased risk of mortality among black soldiers in the U.S. Army, but that it was associated with increased risk of exertional rhabdomyolysis (breakdown of skeletal-muscle tissue).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, the effect of sickle cell trait was less than that of recent statin use.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our results suggest that this allele also negatively affects kidney function, which may indicate that carriers should be monitored clinically for decreases in eGFR

0	NA	GATM	NA	DISCUSS	However, there are several genes in the region and Kottgen et al suggested the nearby gene glycine amidinotransferase (GATM), based on a pathway-level connection of that gene to creatinine biosynthesis.
1	NA	SPATA5L1	rs2467853	DISCUSS	The sentinel non-coding SNP rs2467853 in this region is within the SPATA5L1 gene and is more strongly associated with SPATA5L1 expression in human kidney than GATM (rs2467853 SPATA5L1 beta = 0.77, p = 8.2 x 10-8; GATM beta = 2 x 10-4, p = 0.99).

0	NA	UMOD	NA	DISCUSS	No SNPs in the UMOD region were sufficiently associated with UMOD expression in the human kidney reference data to create predictive models for S-PrediXcan analysis.
0	NA	UMOD	NA	DISCUSS	This suggests that the relationship between UMOD genotypes and kidney function is mediated by a mechanism other than gene expression, or that the proportion of cells from which UMOD is expressed is small and difficult to detect in bulk RNA sequencing of whole kidney.

0	kidney stones	NA	NA	DISCUSS	It is known that some individual genes that influence eGFR are also important for kidney stone formation.
0	kidney stones	UMOD	NA	DISCUSS	For example, decreased production of UMOD is associated with kidney stone formation as uromodulin impairs the aggregation of calcium oxalate crystals, hypertension, arterial stiffness, and CKD
