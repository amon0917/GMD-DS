0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with considerable evidence suggesting an initiation of disease in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus and spreading thereafter to the rest of the brain.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	In this study, we combine genetics and imaging data obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and the AddNeuroMed study.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	To identify genetic susceptibility loci for AD, we conducted a genome-wide study of atrophy in regions associated with neurodegeneration in this condition.
0	NA	ZNF292	rs1925690	ABSTRACT	We identified one single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) with a disease-specific effect associated with entorhinal cortical volume in an intron of the ZNF292 gene (rs1925690; P-value = 2.6x 10-8; corrected P-value for equivalent number of independent quantitative traits = 7.7 x 10-8) and an intergenic SNP, flanking the ARPP-21 gene, with an overall effect on entorhinal cortical thickness (rs11129640; P-value = 5.6 x 10-8; corrected P-value = 1.7 x 10-7).

0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	The US NIH Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the European Union FP6-funded AddNeuroMed study have complementary goals.
0	cognitive defects	NA	NA	INTRO	ADNI is a 5-year public-private partnership investigating the effectiveness of integrating neuroimaging, genetic/biological markers, as well as clinical and neuropsychological assessments in measuring the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer's disease (AD).
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	The main aim of the AddNeuroMed study, also a private-public partnership and a pilot for the European FP6 Innovative Medicines Initiative, is to find biomarkers for AD, in particular for early diagnosis of the disease.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Both projects have acquired similar data, and in this study, we integrate neuroimaging and genetic data obtained from the two projects to identify novel susceptibility loci for AD
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Research to identify genetic factors that predispose to AD recently resulted in the publication of two large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWASs).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Harold et al.
0	Alzheimer's disease	apolipoprotein E	NA	INTRO	analyzed >16000 individuals in a two-stage case-control analysis, identifying, in addition to APOE, two loci that were significantly associated with AD (namely CLU and PICALM).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Another large-scale study by Lambert et al.
0	NA	CLU	NA	INTRO	also found association with the CLU locus and additionally with the CR1 locus.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	These findings have elucidated some of the genes that are causally implicated in predisposition to AD.
0	already harbor disease	NA	NA	INTRO	However, the diseased case versus normal control design of these GWASs and the studies that preceded them have an inherent confound in that a proportion of the apparently normal control population will already harbor disease because of the long clinically silent prodromal phase.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	One way to address this confound is the use of endophenotypes of disease:that is, markers of pathology in vivo that can be used to separate diseased from normal individuals more accurately than can be achieved by clinical assessment alone, and hence have the potential for greater power than studies using the standard AD/normal case-control design.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	One approach to endophenotypes as a marker of disease in genetic studies is the use of imaging measures in a quantitative trait (QT) analysis
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	This imaging-genetics approach has been undertaken by a number of previous studies in AD.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Potkin et al.

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	To allow for multiple testing of five QTs (namely WBV, HPV, VV, ERV and ERT) that are correlated (Supplementary Table 1), we applied Matrix Spectral Decomposition (see http://gump.qimr.edu.au/general/daleN/matSpD/), based on the study by Nyholt, to QTs, which results in an effective number of independent variables of 3, using VeffLi
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We performed linkage disequilibrium (LD)-based SNP grouping in PLINK on the results of our entorhinal cortical thickness analysis using the --clump command with default settings.
0	NA	PICALM	NA	METHODS	We also performed a set-based analysis in PLINK, using SNPs +-100 kb of PICALM and +-750 kb of ARPP-21 (because of the intergenic location of the significant associated SNP) as sets of genes and permuting 10000 times.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	This analysis was implemented by PLINK as follows (from http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/anal.shtml#set): For the gene set, for each SNP, determine which other SNPs are in LD, above a certain threshold R (0.5).

0	NA	EMP1	NA	METHODS	The empirical P-value for set (EMP1) is the number of times the permuted set statistic exceeds the original one for the set
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Finally, we used a novel method for calculating gene-based P-values from GWA results (see Supplementary Methods for details).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We restricted our analysis to ~20 000 protein-coding genes annotated in Ensembl v56 and mapped them to SNPs if the SNP was within 20 kb of the annotated coordinates
0	NA	PICALM	NA	METHODS	To further investigate the evidence of association at the PICALM, ARRP-21 and ZNF292 loci, we imputed SNPs in the region +-500 kb of PICALM and ZNF292 and in +-750 kb of the ARRP-21 locus with minor allele frequency >0.01 and imputation quality scores >=0.99 in the CEU Hapmap phase 2 population and the 1000 Genomes project using Beagle and IMPUTE, respectively, and applied the QT analysis

0	NA	ARPP-21	NA	RESULTS	LD-based SNP grouping was carried out for the ARPP-21 and ZNF292 loci; however, this analysis did not reveal any further SNPs.
0	NA	ARPP-21	NA	RESULTS	A set-based analysis of the ARPP-21 locus using SNPs +- 750 kb of ARPP-21 as a set of genes and permuting 10 000 times, resulted in an empirical P-value < 10-4 and revealed 5 SNPs at P<0.05 passing the LD threshold (see the 'Materials and methods' section)
0	Alzheimer's disease	CLU	NA	RESULTS	In light of recent large-scale GWASs for AD, we then sought to identify any corroboratory evidence in our analyses for the genome-wide significant variants at the CLU, PICALM and CR1 loci from these studies.

0	NA	NA	rs3851179	RESULTS	The PICALM-associated SNP rs3851179 identified by Harold et al., the minor allele of which they found to have an odds ratio of 0.86, is associated with an increase in entorhinal cortical thickness (uncorrected P< 0.05; Table 2b) in our main effect analysis.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We then performed LD-based SNP grouping in PLINK on the results of our entorhinal cortical thickness analysis.
0	NA	PICALM	rs642949	RESULTS	This highlighted the intronic PICALM SNP rs642949 (uncorrected P-value = 9.6 x 10-5) as being in LD with two further SNPs with P-values < 0.001 (Figure 2a).
0	NA	PICALM	NA	RESULTS	We also performed a set-based analysis in PLINK, using SNPs +- 100 kb of PICALM as a gene set and permuting 10 000 times.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Of the 11 SNPs significant at P<0.05, 5 variants were independently significant (based on an r2 threshold of 0.5), resulting in an empirical P-value = 0.0034.

0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Although none of the imputed SNPs reaches suggestive significance, there are a further eleven Hapmap phase 2 SNPs and five 1000 genome SNPs at P-values <10-3 (Figures 2b and c)
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	As there seemed to be multiple nominally positive SNPs in the region, we used a novel method for calculating gene-based P-values from GWA results (see the 'Materials and methods' section).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We restricted our analysis to ~20 000 protein-coding genes annotated in Ensembl v56 and mapped them to genotyped SNPs within 20 kb of the annotated coordinates.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We calculated gene-wide P-values using a modified Fisher's method to combine P-values from correlated tests and applied a local false discovery rate.

0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Genotyping data (~478K SNPs) were integrated with the imaging traits in QT analyses
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We used this imaging QTL approach first for all subjects and then with disease status as an interaction effect because we reasoned that this study design would have greater power to detect disease susceptibility loci than a case versus control design.

0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, many MCI subjects will not progress to AD and a recent meta-analysis by Mitchell et al.
0	dementia	NA	NA	DISCUSS	showed an annual conversion rate of 8.1% and a cumulative proportion of 33.6% for MCI conversion to dementia, although it is noted that some studies show higher proportions of conversion, and in all studies, some MCI subjects fail to progress only because of death.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Although the findings we report in this study will require replication, we note that despite the relatively small sample size compared with GWASs (1000 versus > 10 000) it is striking that we observe main SNP and disease-specific effects that reach nominal genome-wide significance (Table 2a)

0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We have focused on a small number of regions known to be affected in AD and have conducted main and disease-specific effects for all SNPs in both the ADNI and the AddNeuroMed cohorts.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our study design was different from the previously published study of the ADNI cohort by Shen et al.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	in that we restricted our analysis to regions previously strongly implicated in the etiopathology of AD and reprocessed all neuroimages.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This meant that we tested different phenotypes to those of Shen et al.

0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	These differences and the design of the study by Shen et al.
