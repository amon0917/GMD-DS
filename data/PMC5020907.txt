0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	METHODS	The ICPCG consists of multiple international groups focused on the study of high-risk prostate cancer pedigrees and represents the largest available collect of familial prostate cancer cases and pedigrees.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Twelve member sites of the ICPCG consortium provided samples for analysis.
0	cancers	NA	NA	METHODS	These sites included Cancer Council Victoria (Australia), Centre de Recherche sur les Pathologies Prostatiques (CeRePP), Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center:Seattle (FHCRC), University of Tampere (Finland), Johns Hopkins University (JHU), University of Ulm (Germany), Institute of Cancer Research, UK (ICR), Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center:New Orleans (LSU), The Mayo Clinic (Mayo), University of Michigan (Michigan), Northwestern University (Northwestern), and University of Utah (Utah).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Selection of cases and controls was limited to Caucasians (race self-reported).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Each site recruited study participants according to their own protocols; however, to define a set of familial cases, sites were asked to supply only one case from previously sampled pedigrees having at least three related cases with an average age at diagnosis <=75 years.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Sites selected the sampled case from each eligible pedigree that was clinically most aggressive or had the earliest age at diagnosis.
0	cancers	NA	NA	METHODS	Controls were selected to be male, unrelated to cases and each other, and with no prior diagnosis of cancer.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Controls were not matched 1:1 to cases, but were selected, such that the overall distribution of race and birth-year was similar between selected cases and controls.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Only 9 of 12 sites contributed controls.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	However, the principal components analysis (PCA) of genotype data identified that cases from the three sites without controls were found to be of similar genetic background to cases at other sites and were merged accordingly.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The PCA outcomes that were used to merge sites are shown in Supplemental Figure 1.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The specific merging of controls by site is indicated in Table 1, which also shows the composition of cases and controls contributed by each site.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	All sites collected samples under approval from institutional review boards at their respective institutions, and informed consent was obtained for all study participants
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	METHODS	Standardized criteria for determining prostate cancer status were imposed to address the potential for clinical heterogeneity across the 12 sites.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	METHODS	All prostate cancer cases were confirmed by death certificate or medical record.
0	cancers	NA	NA	METHODS	Cases were designated as aggressive if they had: (1) regional or distant stage at diagnosis (stage T3, T4, N1, or M1, based on pathology if radical prostatectomy was done; otherwise, based on clinical stage), (2) tumor Gleason score 8-10 at diagnosis, or poorly differentiated or non-differentiated grade if Gleason score was unavailable, (3) diagnostic PSA >20 ng/ml, or (4) died from metastatic prostate cancer before age 65.
0	aggressive disease	NA	NA	METHODS	These criteria were previously used to define aggressive disease by the ICPCG.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	METHODS	Cases not meeting these criteria were considered less-aggressive prostate cancer.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	According to this definition, there were 1394 aggressive cases and 1096 less-aggressive cases and 21 of 'unknown' aggressive status (not analyzed) among the set of cases passing quality control.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	METHODS	Two phenotypes were analyzed for GWAS, all prostate cancer and aggressive cases versus less-aggressive cases, applying the ICPCG definition
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	All participants were genotyped on the Illumina HumanOmni5Exome-4v1-1+exome SNP array at the Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The exome portion of the data set was analyzed and reported separately.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Quality control was performed at the time of genotyping by CIDR in conjunction with the GENEVA Coordinating Center at the University of Washington.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The quality control procedure removed 43 participants because of previously undocumented relationships closer than third degree.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	PCA of approximately 150,000 SNPs identified a relatively homogeneous subset of the cases, and 53 outliers were removed.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	All individuals had call rates greater than 99 %.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Quality control removed 57 cases and 39 controls, leaving 2511 cases and 1382 controls for analysis.
0	error and experimental error	MAF	NA	METHODS	SNP markers were filtered out according to HWE p value <0.0001, minor allele frequency (MAF < 0.01), >1 Mendelian error detected in a set of duplicated samples, and a missing call rate >=2 %, which led to the removal of approximately 45 % of markers (of which a large proportion was monomorphic), leaving 2,567,713 SNPs to serve as the imputation basis.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The genomic inflation parameter (lambda) was 0.98 for the observed genotype data indicating that population stratification and cryptic relatedness between study subjects are well controlled in this data set.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The GENEVA Coordinating Center also imputed genotypes for SNPs that were observed in the 1000 Genomes Project that did not occur on the SNP array.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Imputation used the IMPUTE2 software and estimated haplotypes using a reference panel of 1092 samples from International HapMap Consortium Phases 2 and 3 haplotypes.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The target imputation set included approximately 27.7M SNPs, which were analyzed in GWAS.
0	NA	MAF>1%	NA	METHODS	Approximately, 66 % of the resulting target SNPs had MAF <1 % (dosage) or IMPUTE INFO score <=0.3, leaving approximately 9.4M SNPs for analysis
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	GWAS was performed with the PLINK software v1.9 using the logistic regression analysis at each imputed marker and including study site assignment.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The first four PCA eigenvectors estimated during quality control were included as covariates, because a test of association indicated a significant relationship between affection status and eigenvectors 1, 2, and 4.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Following the widely accepted standard for interpreting GWAS, significance was established for SNPs with p < 5e-8.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Regional association plots were generated with the LocusExplorer software.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Details of the publicly available data sets that were used in the preparation of the figure are described elsewhere.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Linkage disequilibrium (LD) estimates between markers originated from 1000 Genomes Project phase 3 data (May 2013 release).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Human genome version 19 coordinates are given throughout
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Because of the potential for linkage disequilibrium between markers, we analyzed each region containing multiple significant SNPs with forward stepwise regression and elastic net to identify SNPs with an independent contribution to the signal at each region.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Markers were selected from each region with GWAS p < 0.01 (to reduce the number of simultaneously analyzed markers); all were within 500 kb of the significant flanking markers in the region.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	For the forward selection analysis, the 'step' function in R (base package) was employed for model development which included study site assignment, and the first four eigenvectors estimated during quality control as covariates.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Although stepwise selection is commonly used in GWAS, there are several problems that compromise its value for high-dimensional data: the resulting regression coefficients are biased away from zero, it does not adequately handle correlated markers, and there is an inflated risk of capitalizing on chance features of the data.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	For these reasons, we also used the elastic-net method, which is designed to select variables of interest by addressing the high dimensionality of the data set and correlated markers.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The 'glmnet' package in R was used for the elastic-net analysis; study site and the PCA eigenvectors were retained in all models.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We selected SNPs from the elastic-net analysis that had non-zero coefficients after tuning alpha and lambda penalties by tenfold cross validation (x100) with the 'caret' R package
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	METHODS	We compared the ORs estimated for SNPs previously reported to be associated with prostate cancer with the ORs estimated for this study.
0	NA	FUT2	NA	METHODS	We used the following statistic to test for a significant departure between the ORs of the two studies being compared:  where OR1 is the previously reported OR for an SNP, OR2 is the estimated OR from the current study for that SNP, and SE1 and SE2 are the standard errors of the ORs.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The statistic Z follows a normal distribution.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	A low p value indicates a substantial departure between the two estimated ORs.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Positive Z scores indicate a stronger effect size in the previous study, and a negative Z score indicates a stronger effect size in the familial cohort
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	rs138042437	METHODS	The SNP rs138042437 (referred to as kgp28696802 in the imputed data set), which had a high OR in the GWAS, was followed up to assess the segregation of the rare allele with prostate cancer.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	METHODS	The frequency of the SNP was estimated from genotype data for all available cases and controls from the PRACTICAL Consortium (members of the consortium can be found in the Supplemental Table 1) to gauge effect size in cases not ascertained on the basis of their family history of prostate cancer.
0	NA	NA	rs138042437	METHODS	Sanger sequencing of additional relatives for rs138042437 used Qiagen Multiplex Master Mix following the Qiagen protocol with a 64 degree annealing temperature using forward primer [gatcagagtggtccagaatgg] and reverse primer [ggagaagacagagactgaagaagg], which produced a product size of 492 bases
0	NA	NA	rs138042437	METHODS	A test of over-transmission of the rare allele at rs138042437 to affected relatives assumes a null hypothesis of random segregation and that the number of pedigrees where specified individuals share a rare variant is the sum of independent Bernoulli trials with differing probabilities of success depending on the configuration of observed carriers in each pedigree.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The exact distribution of the statistic was computed with the probability of success for each Bernoulli trial (pedigree) defined as the probability of each configuration of carriers in the pedigree as determined by RVsharing program [RVsharing R software package ], conditional on the proband carrying the variant.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The RVsharing program computes the probability that specified carriers of a rare variant (assumed to be <1 %) in the pedigree share the variant, assuming that the variant has entered the pedigree only once.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The probability mass function (pmf) for the number of sharing cases was calculated for each pedigree.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The pmf for the total number of sharing cases summed over all pedigrees was then computed simply by taking the convolution of the pedigree pmfs
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Haplotypes at the 8q24.21 locus were estimated from imputed genotypes at 8q24.21 using the SHAPEIT2 software.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	METHODS	Haplotypes were also estimated from genotypes derived from targeted sequencing data of the 8q24.21 locus in an independent set of 56 prostate cancer cases, also ascertained from ICPCG member sites but not included in the GWAS data set.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Haplotypes were estimated from the targeted sequencing data to identify the presence of other rare or novel variants that might not be present in the imputed markers.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Targeted sequencing data capture used a targeted Agilent SureSelect Custom capture library designed to collect all coding and non-repetitive non-coding bases in the 8q24.21 locus.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Sequence data were generated following the protocol for Ilumina HiSeq 101 Cycle Paired End Sequencing (v4) until an average read depth of 100 was achieved for intended capture bases.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Reads were aligned with BWA v0.7.12, variants were called with GATK v3.5, and variant annotation was produced by Annovar (2015-06-17)
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Figure 1 shows the Manhattan plot of the GWAS results.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Figure 2 shows a QQ plot for all the GWAS statistics.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The QQ plot shows a slight departure of the distribution of test statistics from the expected distribution (lambda = 1.08) that is likely an artifact of imputation and not indicative of population stratification between cases and controls (since no inflation was apparent in the observed genotype data, lambda = 0.98).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The GWAS identified multiple significant SNPs at six regions, including 3q26.31, 6q24.3, 8q24.21, 10q11.23, 11q13.3, and 17q12.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Table 2 reports the most significant SNP from each of these regions, and Supplemental Table 2 shows the 135 significant SNPs (p < 5e-8) that occurred in the GWAS
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	For the regions with multiple significant SNPs, a forward selection and elastic-net analysis in each region identified which SNPs within the region contributed an independent signal.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The analyzed regions were 6q25.3, 8q24.21, 10q11.23, 11q13.3, and 17q12.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The 3q26.31 region had only one significant SNP and was not investigated further.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	SNPs contributing independent signals in these regions were all previously published and validated, or proximal and in high LD with associated SNPs.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Table 3 shows the markers included by these two selection approaches and the nearest previously reported SNP, if different.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The overlap of the forward selection and elastic-net analysis at each region retained only one SNP in the final model for each region, with the exception of the 8q24.21 region, which retained nine SNPs, four of which were also significant in the GWAS.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	A benefit of elastic net is that it allows highly correlated SNPs to be selected in a model, whereas forward selection might select only one.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	This makes sense when it is statistically impossible to distinguish among highly correlated SNPs, any of which could be a functional SNP, or any of which could be highly correlated with a functional SNP.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Elastic-net achieve this by imposing a penalty on the absolute values of the SNP regression coefficients, which shrinks the unimportant coefficients to zero, while also shrinking the larger coefficients.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	This avoids the overly optimistic results from forward selection while causing the coefficients from elastic net to be closer to zero than those from forward selection, as illustrated in Table 3.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Figure 3 shows the locations of significant markers from the GWAS that were retained by the variance reduction methods applied to genotype data in the region for the 8q24.21 locus as well as the approximate LD structure of the region
0	NA	OR = 13.3	rs138042437	RESULTS	The SNP rs138042437 (p = 1.7e-8, OR = 13.3, 95 % confidence interval [5.4, 32.7], minor allele G, MAF = 0.015) exhibited the highest estimated effect size of any marker in the GWAS and is in high LD (r2 = 1) with previously reported SNP rs188140481 (p = 5e-9, OR 9.4, 95 % confidence interval [4.4, 19.9], minor allele = A, MAF = 0.016), and SNP rs183373024 (p = 2.9e-9, OR = 7.6, 95=% confidence interval [3.9, 14.9], minor allele = G, MAF = 0.017).
0	NA	MAF	rs138042437	RESULTS	For rs138042437, familial cases in this study had MAF = 2.2 %, compared to 0.2 % for controls.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Population estimates of global minor allele frequency are 0.4 % in 1000 Genomes Project SNP annotation and 0.2 % in dbSNP annotation.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	MAF	rs138042437	RESULTS	The MAF of the rare allele for rs138042437 in the prostate cancer case-control data set from the PRACTICAL Consortium was 2.2 % (out of 22,898 alleles) for cases and 1.1 % (out of 23,054 total alleles) for controls [OR = 1.90, 95 % confidence interval (1.71, 2.12)].
0	NA	NA	rs138042437	RESULTS	The comparatively high frequency of the rare allele at rs138042437 in the much larger set of controls from the PRACTICAL Consortium data set than controls in this study indicates that the estimated allele frequency in the controls is most likely too low, and hence, the magnitude of the estimated effect size for the marker is likely over-stated in this data set
0	Breast and prostate cancer	BRCA1	NA	RESULTS	We also scanned for association signals at SNPs within known predisposition genes for prostate cancer, BRCA1, BRCA2, and HOXB13.
0	NA	BRCA1	NA	RESULTS	Association at BRCA1/2 genes was modest (most extreme p = 1e-3).
0	Breast and prostate cancer	HOXB13	rs138213197	RESULTS	For HOXB13, the SNP rs138213197 (p = 2.8e-7; OR = 4.7), representing the G84E mutation, had a similar estimated effect size to a recent meta-analysis of prostate cancer in 120,617 men (OR = 4.5, 95 % confidence interval [3.28, 6.20])
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	RESULTS	Ninety-one of the 103 SNPs previously reported and validated as significantly associated with prostate cancer risk in GWAS of cases and controls not ascertained on the basis of family history (summarized in), and were available for analysis.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The Z statistic compared the estimated ORs between the current study and the original report of a significant association for each SNP.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	RESULTS	Supplemental Figure 2 shows all of the outcomes of the comparisons of ORs for 91 of the SNPs previously associated with prostate cancer.
0	familial prostate cancer	NA	NA	RESULTS	For the large majority of SNPs, the effect size (OR) did not differ significantly between the originally reported estimate and the one observed for the familial prostate cancer cases vs. controls comparisons.
1	NA	MLPH	rs7584330	RESULTS	Only three SNPs had a significantly higher estimated risk among the familial cases compared to controls: rs7584330 at 2q37 in MLPH [OR = 1.26, previously reported OR = 1.06; Z = -2.9], rs9364554 at 6q25 in SLC22A3 [OR = 1.35, previously reported OR = 1.28, Z = -3.5], and rs7931342 at 11q13 near MYEOV [OR 1.38, previously reported OR = -1.27, =Z = -2.7].
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	RESULTS	However, the outcomes of these comparisons appear to fall within an expected distribution that would be achieved by chance, suggesting that increased ORs may likely represent false positives, and also suggesting that most of the risk SNPs detected in population-based GWAS apply to our study with cased enriched for prostate cancer family history
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	A Manhattan plot showing the outcomes from the GWAS of aggressive cases (n 1394) and less-aggressive cases (n = 1096) appears in Fig.

0	aggressive disease	NA	rs2735839	RESULTS	Similarly, none of the SNPs previously associated with aggressive disease were significant in this GWAS; Specifically, SNPs rs2735839 (chr19:51.36 Mb; p = 0.110), rs11672691 (chr19:41.99 Mb; p = 0.020), rs11704416 (chr22:40.44 Mb; p 0.017), rs35148638 (chr5:86.61 Mb; p = 0.33), and rs78943174 (chr3:175.25 Mb; p = 0.34)
0	NA	NA	rs138042437	RESULTS	The GWAS identified 112 carriers of the rare allele for rs138042437 (107 cases and 5 controls).
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	rs188140481	RESULTS	Given the evidence of association of SNP rs188140481 (in high LD with rs138042437; r2 = 1.0) with prostate cancer presented in a previous GWAS study, the very high estimated effect size of the variants in this data, and the availability of already sampled affected relatives, 116 affected relatives of 62 rare-allele carriers in the GWAS cases were tested for the presence of the rare allele; 78 additional affected carriers and 38 non-carriers were observed.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The 116 affected relatives included 79 siblings (56 carriers), 3 half-siblings (3 carriers), 9 avunculars (5 carriers), 20 cousins (13 carriers), and 5 more distant relatives (1 carrier).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The exact p value for the observed sharing calculated from the convolution pmf was 8.5e-11.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	For reference, the mean and standard deviation of the distribution were 43.9 and 5.0, respectively, which, using the normal approximation would give p = 6e-12.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The extreme p value indicates strong evidence for segregation of the rare allele in affected relatives of index carriers
0	NA	NA	rs183373024	RESULTS	Haplotypes were estimated for 1083 imputed markers falling within 10 kb of three significant markers in high LD at the 8q24.21 locus [rs183373024, rs188140481, and rs138042437 (r2 = 1.0, MAFs < 1.7)], defined as 128.094-128.218 kb.

0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	An identical haplotype was estimated for 98 cases and 5 controls (92 % of risk-allele carriers) that contained the rare allele of all three SNPs and no other rare variants (MAFs < 2 %).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The complete haplotype is given in Supplemental Table 3.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	RESULTS	Haplotypes were also estimated from genotypes of 56 prostate cancer cases (in an independent study of cases ascertained from ICPCG member sites and not included in the GWAS data set) with targeted sequencing data available at the 8q24 region to test for the presence of other rare variants not captured in the imputed genotype data that may be detectable with targeted sequence data.
0	NA	NA	rs183373024	RESULTS	Seven carriers of the risk alleles at rs183373024, rs188140481, and rs138042437 were identified among the 56 cases who shared an identical estimated haplotype spanning 128,103,679-128,223,746 bp on chromosome 8 that did not contain any other rare or novel variants.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Two of 112 carriers observed in the GWAS data set (both were cases), 3 of 116 additionally sampled affected relative carriers, and 1 of 7 sequenced case carriers were homozygous for the rare allele.

0	aggressive disease	NA	rs183373024	RESULTS	In terms of aggressiveness, the three SNPs on the haplotype rs183373024, rs188140481, and rs138042437 had high effect sizes in the GWAS of all prostate cancer (ORs >= 7.6) and low effect sizes in the aggressive GWAS (ORs = 0.9).
0	NA	NA	rs138042437	RESULTS	The investigation of clinical variables that accompanied the GWAS samples did not distinguish affected risk-allele carriers at rs138042437 from non-carrier cases in the ICPCG data set.
0	aggressiveness status	NA	NA	RESULTS	Affected carriers were not different with respect to age at diagnosis (average age for carriers = 60.45 years, non-carriers = 60.35; t test p = 0.9), ICPCG aggressiveness status (aggressive carriers = 37 %, aggressive non-carriers = 35 %; X2 p = 0.7), or Gleason score (high = 7+, moderate or low <7; high Gleason carriers = 63 %, high Gleason non-carriers = 60 %; X2 p = 0.6)

0	NA	NA	rs183373024	DISCUSS	Of particular interest, however, is that SNPs rs183373024, rs188140481, and rs138042437 at 8q24.21 exhibited very high-risk estimates in this study (ORs >= 7.6).
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	rs188140481	DISCUSS	SNP rs188140481 was previously associated with prostate cancer in a GWAS conducted on 1795 Icelanders, where SNPs were imputed from the whole genome data.
1	NA	CASC19	rs138042437	DISCUSS	Two of the SNPs occur in long non-coding RNAs, CASC19 (rs138042437), and PRNCR1 (rs183373024), which are a predominant feature of the 8q24.21 region.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The rare alleles of all three SNPs were observed in 107 familial cases in this GWAS population, and 62 cases of which had 116 additionally sampled affected relatives available who were subsequently genotyped; the variant was observed in 78 additional relatives (p = 8.5e-11), indicating strong evidence for co-segregation of the variants with prostate cancer in these families
0	NA	NA	rs183373024	DISCUSS	A consistent haplotype of three rare SNPs was observed among the majority of risk-allele carriers in the GWAS cohort at the 8q24.21 locus, rs183373024, rs188140481, and rs130842437 in LD block 2 of the 8q24.21 region.
0	familial prostate cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	A consistent haplotype was also identified for seven risk-allele carriers for the three SNPs in a set of 56 additional familial prostate cancer cases with targeted sequencing data available for the 8q24.21 region.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The fact that no additional novel variants were detected among the set of variants on the haplotype estimated from the targeted sequence data indicates either high fidelity of the imputation strategy, or low fidelity of targeted sequencing, in terms of capturing the diversity of the region.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	It may be possible that further rare variation exists on the risk haplotype that is not observable through either high-density SNP genotyping or targeted sequencing, but may be observable with the application of the whole genome sequencing of carriers
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	It is not clear which of the three variants on the risk haplotype conveys an alteration in risk for prostate cancer, either singly or in combination.
0	NA	FOXA1	rs183373024	DISCUSS	However, a recent investigation of ENCODE ChipSeq data using the FunciSNP R package identified that rs183373024 occurs at a FoxA1 binding site, which could plausibly indicate regulation of genomic features in the region.
0	carcinomas of the colon	PRNCR1	rs183373024	DISCUSS	Furthermore, SNP rs183373024 is in the long non-coding RNA PRNCR1, upregulation of which has recently been shown to enhance cellular proliferation in colon cancer.
0	NA	NA	rs138042437	DISCUSS	The SNP rs138042437 resides within a POLR2A binding site indicating that this SNP may impact transcription of nearby genomic features.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Despite the fact that biological activity is not currently well understood for most long non-coding RNAs, some progress is being made.
0	cancers	CARLo-5	NA	DISCUSS	For instance, another long non-coding RNA in the 8q24.21 region, CARLo-5 (CCAT1 locus), has recently been shown through functional investigation to affect cell-cycle regulation and tumor development indicating that long non-coding RNAs can have substantial impact on currently cryptic biological processes
0	aggressiveness status	NA	rs138042437	DISCUSS	No significant differences were observed when considering clinical variables (i.e., age at diagnosis, ICPCG aggressiveness status, and Gleason score) for carriers and non-carriers of the risk alleles at rs138042437, and the three SNPs on the risk haplotype did not show even nominal evidence of association in the case-case aggressiveness GWAS comparisons.
0	aggressive disease	NA	rs188140481	DISCUSS	Furthermore, no significant differences were observed in a previous investigation that reported results by age at diagnosis and aggressiveness status for carriers and non-carriers of rs188140481 in the Icelandic population.
0	aggressive disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Taken together, these observations suggest that the haplotype is not characterized as a marker for more aggressive disease
0	Breast and prostate cancer	HOXB13	rs138213197	DISCUSS	Of particular note, the three SNPs on the haplotype exhibited large estimated effect sizes in the GWAS (ORs >= 7.6), larger in magnitude than the recently discovered predisposition gene for prostate cancer, HOXB13 (rs138213197; OR = 4.7; p = 2.8e-7), which was characterized as a prostate cancer predisposition gene on the basis of demonstrated segregation of a deleterious variant in prostate cancer pedigrees (Huang 2012)
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Comparisons of the estimated ORs between previously reported prostate cancer risk SNPs and the estimates from this familial cases vs. unaffected control data set did not have detectable differences for the majority of SNPs tested, indicating similar risks for the majority of known prostate cancer associated SNPs in this study population.
0	aggressive disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The GWAS of familial aggressive cases did not reveal any novel significant findings and did not statistically confirm SNPs previously associated with aggressive disease, possibly indicating a lack of statistical power for the aggressive phenotype in this data set
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The major strengths of a GWAS, including familial cases, are the ability to detect SNPs with larger effect sizes using a modest sample size and the availability of previously sampled affected relatives who can be subsequently analyzed to test for segregation.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Here, the strengths of this design were sufficient to compensate for the lower statistical power of the design compared to larger case-control data sets.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	One way to interpret the findings of the study is to consider that if functional validation of the three candidate SNPs is achieved, which appears at least probable in the context of other functional investigations of the 8q24.21 region, the study will have at least partially explained prostate cancer susceptibility in 48 families with multiple affected men.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Fine-mapping of this region in a large multiethnic cohort will add further insight on these variants/haplotypes and help to determine the most likely causal variants.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In summary, the strong evidence for co-segregation of the risk haplotype with prostate cancer further characterizes the haplotype as a predisposition locus for prostate cancer
