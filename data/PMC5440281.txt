0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Hebert et al.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	predict that the total number of individuals with AD dementia will be 13.8 million by 2050.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	This prediction, coupled with a lack of disease-modifying treatments, is estimated to have cumulative costs of more than $20 trillion by 2050 for the care of AD patients.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	To date, extensive efforts have been made to delineate a set of risk factors that affect the development of AD.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	In particular, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been used to identify genetic variants that may contribute to AD.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Most GWASs of AD have focused on the detection of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with the susceptibility of developing AD.
0	Alzheimer's disease	beta-amyloid (Abeta)	NA	INTRO	The early onset of AD is known to result from mutations in one of three genes: the amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PSEN1), or presenilin 2 (PSEN2).
0	Alzheimer's disease	apolipoprotein E	NA	INTRO	The inheritance of the e4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) has a substantial impact on the late onset of sporadic AD.
0	NA	CLU	NA	INTRO	Recent GWASs have identified additional AD-related genes, including clusterin (CLU), complement receptor 1 (CR1), and phosphatidylinositol-binding clathrin assembly protein gene (PICALM), whereby those genes alter production of the amyloid beta peptide (Abeta)
0	cognitive defects	NA	NA	INTRO	In the present study, we aimed to detect genetic common variants associated with accelerated cognitive decline after the conversion of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD.
0	cognitive defects	NA	NA	INTRO	MCI is a clinical syndrome characterized by insidious onset and progression of cognitive impairments.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	It is often considered as a transitional stage between normal aging and AD, because approximately 50% of MCI patients develop AD in 5 years from diagnosis.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Critically, therapeutic interventions and disease-modifying drugs appear to be more effective during the MCI or early stage of AD than at the more severe stages of AD.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	As such, it is an ongoing quest to delineate a set of risk factors that affect conversion from MCI to AD.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Recent GWASs have focused on the following phenotypes related to MCI-AD progression: binary outcome indicating MCI-AD conversion, time to conversion from MCI to AD, and cognitive decline.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	For example, Hu et al.
0	cognitive defects	NA	NA	INTRO	(2011) found novel loci to be associated with longitudinal cognitive changes of MCI patients and those loci were also associated with time to conversion from MCI to AD.
0	cognitive defects	NA	NA	INTRO	Here, we only focus on an MCI-AD conversion group to identify genetic common variants contributing to rapid cognitive decline after an MCI patient develops AD
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	We analyzed the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; ADNI-1, ADNI-2, and ADNI-GO) cohort data.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Among them, there remained 245 participants who converted to AD at follow-up.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Longitudinal Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognition (ADAS-Cog) scores were used to measure cognitive function including memory, language, praxis, and orientation domain scores indicated greater cognitive impairment.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	To identify SNPs associated with longitudinal cognitive changes, we tested interaction effects between individual SNPs and AD diagnosis trajectory (MCI = 0, AD = 1) on the longitudinal ADAS-Cog scores.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	To account for individual variability of (1) baseline ADAS-Cog score and (2) the effect size of AD diagnosis trajectory, random effects for intercept and slope of AD diagnosis trajectory were incorporated in our model

1	cognitive defects	PDS5B	NA	DISCUSS	It suggests that the PDS5B gene is associated with cognitive dysfunction in both early and transition stages of MCI
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Systematic review: We used PubMed and Google Scholar to review the literature related to genetic association analyses of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Also, we used them to search for articles showing any interesting relationship between our significant loci to AD and AD-related diseases
0	cognitive defects	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Interpretation: We identified new six genes that could be associated with accelerated cognitive decline of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects after their conversion to AD.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The genes had been implicated in other AD or AD-related disease studies.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our study suggests that the genetic factors have affected the ADAS-Cog score changes within MCI-AD conversion subjects.
0	cognitive defects	NA	NA	DISCUSS	It helps to understand the underlying mechanism of accelerated cognitive impairment of AD patients within their transition period from MCI
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Future directions: A follow-up study should be taken as future works to examine if the identified genes are replicated in other and bigger samples
0	cognitive defects	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In summary, we detected six genes that putatively associated with accelerated cognitive decline of MCI subjects after they developed AD.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The genes had been implicated in other AD or AD-related disease studies.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This GWAS sheds light on what genetic factors have impact on the ADAS-Cog score changes within MCI-AD conversion subjects.
0	cognitive defects	NA	NA	DISCUSS	It allows better understanding of the underlying mechanism and pathology of accelerated cognitive impairment of AD patients within their transition period from MCI, which further may help to develop future treatments targeting the identified genetic loci.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Although the associations were significant at the 1 x 10-5 suggestive level, a bigger sample size could ensure more significant results.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Also, a follow-up study is recommended as future works to examine if the identified genes are replicated in other samples
