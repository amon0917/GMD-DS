0	Type 2 diabetes	CHD	NA	ABSTRACT	To evaluate the shared genetic etiology of type-2 diabetes (T2D) and coronary heart disease (CHD), we conducted a multi-ethnic study of genetic variation genome-wide for both diseases in up to 265,678 subjects for T2D and 260,365 subjects for CHD.
0	NA	CHD	NA	ABSTRACT	We identify 16 previously unreported loci for T2D and one for CHD, including a novel T2D association at a missense variant in HLA-DRB5 (OR=1.29).
0	NA	CHD	NA	ABSTRACT	We show that genetically mediated increase in T2D risk also confers higher CHD risk.
0	NA	CHD	NA	ABSTRACT	Joint analysis of T2D loci demonstrated that 24% are associated with CHD, highlighting eight variants - two of which are coding - where T2D and CHD associations appear to co-localize, and a novel joint T2D/CHD association which also replicated for T2D.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Variants associated with both outcomes implicate several novel pathways including cellular proliferation and cardiovascular development
0	Type 2 diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	The global epidemic of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is expected to worsen over the coming decades, and the number of people with T2D is projected to reach ~592 million by 2035.
0	coronary artery disease	CHD	NA	INTRO	T2D is also a major vascular risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD) which is the leading cause of death worldwide.
0	NA	CHD	NA	INTRO	Patients with T2D are also at a twofold higher risk of mortality due to CHD compared to those that do not have T2D, though the mechanisms that link T2D with increased risk of CHD remain inadequately understood.
0	NA	GLP-1	NA	INTRO	Recently, a coding variant in the gene encoding the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R) was reported that was associated with lower fasting glucose, lower T2D susceptibility, and modestly with reduced risk for CHD, a result consistent with existing therapeutic perturbation of this gene.
0	NA	CHD	NA	INTRO	This type of result is intriguing, and motivates the search for additional loci with this type of genetic support: association with protective effects for both T2D and CHD in humans.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Such targets would merit detailed molecular, functional, and therapeutic experimentation, but we need first to identify these candidate loci from existing and newly generated data sets
0	NA	CHD	NA	INTRO	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have advanced our understanding of the genetic architecture individually for each disease, yielding discovery of several dozen loci for T2D and CHD.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Previous work has also demonstrated a genetic correlation between both endpoints, though no study has directly compared individual variants beyond established sites across the genome nor examined the pathways that are shared between the two outcomes.
1	NA	CDKN2A	NA	INTRO	Regional association for multiple SNPs for both endpoints at a locus has been observed (e.g., CDKN2A/2B or APOE).
0	NA	CHD	NA	INTRO	These initial observations indicate that the genetic pathways that connect T2D and CHD may have a modest impact on disease risk, hence requiring large sample sizes to enable robust discovery
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We therefore assembled a discovery association set for T2D comprising of 73,337 T2D cases and 192,341 controls to first enable discovery of novel loci for T2D.
0	NA	CHD	NA	INTRO	Second, we used additional genetic data on 90,831 CHD cases and 169,534 controls to identify genetic pathways connected with both outcomes
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We used genetic data from 48,437 individuals (13,525 T2D cases and 34,912 controls) of South Asian (n = 28,139; 9,654 T2D cases and 18,485 controls) and European (n = 20,298; 3,871 T2D cases and 16,427 controls) descent.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We utilized non-overlapping data for T2D from the DIAGRAM consortium and conducted combined discovery analysis on 198,258 participants (48,365 T2D cases and 149,893 controls).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Characteristics of the participants and information on genotyping QC are summarized in Supplementary Tables 1-3 and Supplementary Figure 1.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	After removing known loci, we advanced 21 novel loci with suggestive association with T2D (P <= 5 x 10-6).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We performed further testing of these SNPs in additional samples of up to 67,420 individuals (24,972 cases and 42,448 controls) of South Asian (n = 13,960; 4,587 T2D cases and 9,373 controls), European (n = 2,479; 387 T2D cases and 2,092 controls), and East-Asian descent (n = 50,981; 19,998 T2D cases and 30,983 controls).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Our combined discovery and replication analyses included 265,678 participants (73,337 T2D cases and 192,341 controls) (Supplementary Figure 1a).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	In the combined analysis across both stages, 15 SNPs at previously unreported loci for T2D obtained genome-wide significance (fixed-effects meta-analysis P < 5 x 10-8, Table 1).
0	NA	NA	rs10507349	RESULTS	A previous report found one of our variants (rs10507349) strongly associated with T2D, but we report genome-wide significance for this variant here for the first time.
0	Supplementary Figure 1a	NA	NA	RESULTS	Population-specific analyses (i.e., Europeans only or South Asians only) identified one additional locus where a sentinel variant obtained genome-wide significance in only European participants (Table 1, P Figure 1, Supplementary Figures 2 and 3, and Supplementary Tables 4 and 5).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Aside from this case, there was little evidence of heterogeneity of effect between the ancestry groups in either our primary genetic analyses or across the two stages (Supplementary Figure 2).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We replicated previously reported associations with T2D at 59 loci at genome-wide significance; a further 25 known loci were associated with T2D at < 0.05 (Figure 1 and Supplementary Table 4).
0	NA	NA	rs76895963	RESULTS	We did not observe association at 3 loci (rs76895963, rs7330796, rs4523957) in our overall meta-analyses, owing to their previous discovery in subjects of East Asian ancestry (Supplementary Table 4).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	To nominate candidate genes and pathways, we obtained expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) data from the MuTHER consortium and GTEx (v6, Supplementary Table 6).
1	NA	ITFG3	NA	RESULTS	These data suggest a candidate gene at two loci (ITFG3 and PLEKHA1) where the lead eQTL association strongly tagged the T2D association (r2 = 1.0)
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	To identify coding variants that may influence protein structure at unreported T2D loci, we obtained data on up to 31,207 individuals (9,500 T2D cases, 21,707 controls) of South Asian (7,832 T2D cases, 16,703 controls) and European origin (1,668 T2D cases, 5,004 controls) (Methods) genotyped on the Exome-chip.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We investigated 505 variants captured by the exome-chip within +-250kbp flanking regions of the sentinel SNPs.
0	NA	HLA-DRB5	rs701884	RESULTS	We identified one missense variant in HLA-DRB5 (rs701884), that was associated with T2D risk at close to exome-wide levels of significance (fixed-effects meta-analysis P < 2 x 10-7) (Supplementary Table 7).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The missense variant was found to have a relatively stronger impact on disease risk compared to the lead non-coding variant.
1	NA	HLA-DRB5	rs701884	RESULTS	At HLA-DRB5 the odds ratio (OR) for T2D for the missense variant (rs701884) was 1.29 (95% CI: 1.23 - 1.35; P = 4.8 x 10-7) compared to the T2D OR of 1.06 (95% CI: 1.04-1.08; P = 2.1 x 10-10) for the non-coding variant (rs2050188).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Existing knowledge on gene function is summarized in Supplementary Table 8
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	To help understand the underlying biological mechanisms, we examined the association of genetic variation at newly discovered loci with a range of phenotypes and biomarkers (n = 70 traits) (Supplementary Table 9).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We also used an association screen against a panel of 105 phenotypic traits measured in the PROMIS study in up to 17,542 participants (Supplementary Table 10).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	For these 17 loci, we conducted 4,275 variant-phenotype analyses using linear regression resulting in a Bonferroni-adjusted significance threshold of P = 1.5 x 10-5.
1	obese	TMEM18	NA	RESULTS	Allelic variation that increased T2D risk was associated at TMEM18 with increased BMI (P = 4.39 x 10-52), BMI in childhood (P = 7.95 x 10-12), obesity (P = 2.50 x 10-25) and obesity in childhood (P = 2.85 x 10-20); at KL, with increased fasting glucose (P = 2.26 x 10-8); at PLEKHA1 with increased risk of neovascular disease (P = 2.71 x 10-94); at SLC22A1, with increased Lp(a) levels (P = 5.10 x 10-6); at CMIP, with decreased HDL-C (P = 1.32 x 10-19), increased triglycerides (P = 2.14 x 10-7) and decreased adiponectin (P = 1.87 x 10-18)
0	NA	CHD	NA	RESULTS	We next examined the relationships of sentinel T2D SNPs with the risk of CHD at all T2D loci (Supplementary Table 11).
0	NA	CHD	NA	RESULTS	For analyses in relation to CHD, we used data on up to 260,365 participants (90,831 CHD cases and 169,534 controls) (Methods).
0	NA	CHD	NA	RESULTS	We found allelic variation at 17 T2D loci to be nominally associated with CHD risk at P < 0.01, which was more than expected (17 of 106 T2D SNPs, binomial test P = 5.9 x 10-13).
0	NA	IRS1	rs7578326	RESULTS	In one case, we found that the T2D sentinel SNP rs7578326 (the IRS1 locus) was associated with both T2D and CHD at genome-wide levels of significance (Supplementary Table 11 and Supplementary Figure 4).
0	NA	IRS1	NA	RESULTS	To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of genetic variation at IRS1 associated with CHD beyond a reasonable doubt (Supplementary Note).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	In what follows, we investigate the relationship between these two endpoints in more detail
0	NA	CHD	NA	RESULTS	First, we examined if elevated T2D risk conferred a higher risk of CHD using the framework of Mendelian Randomization (MR) and examined if all genetic T2D risk pathways impact CHD susceptibility in a similar way.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We calculated genetic risk scores comprising collections of SNPs associated with T2D and potentially a range of cardiometabolic traits (Methods).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	These analyses underscore three key findings.
0	NA	CHD	NA	RESULTS	First, a genotype risk score based on variants exclusively associated with increased risk of T2D (Methods, Supplementary Table 12 and 13) was significantly associated with increased CHD risk (OR = 1.26, Wald-test P = 3.3 x 10-8), supporting a causal role for T2D in CHD etiology in a directionally consistent manner (Supplementary Table 14).
0	NA	CHD	NA	RESULTS	Second, T2D risk scores that involved variants based on their association with established risk factors for CHD (blood pressure, BMI, lipids and anthropometric traits, Supplementary Table 13) revealed significant differences in their estimated effects in relation to CHD (OR = 1.07 to 1.43, Cochran's Heterogeneity Test P = 1.4 x 10-5), indicating that the genetic mechanisms and underlying pathways that increase risk of T2D do not uniformly impact CHD risk in the same manner (Supplementary Table 14).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Finally, in contrast to these scores, variants associated with T2D and glucose or insulin-related traits, but not other traits, were not associated with CHD (OR = 1.07, Wald-test P = 0.06) (Supplementary Table 14); though could be due to reduced power of this instrument relative to others, as has been observed previously.
0	NA	CHD	NA	RESULTS	These analyses indicate that pathways segregating genetic susceptibility for T2D may not have an equivalent impact on CHD risk
0	NA	CHD	NA	RESULTS	We next looked for enrichment in the consistency of the risk allele associated with both T2D and CHD across the genome.
0	NA	CHD	NA	RESULTS	In our meta-analyses, of the 1,260 variants associated with T2D at a P < 5 x 10-8, we found that 76.1% of the T2D risk alleles were associated with higher risk of CHD as well, in comparison with an expectation of 50% under the null hypothesis (binomial test P = 2.6 x 10-33, Table 2).
0	NA	CHD	NA	RESULTS	In contrast, variants associated with CHD at P < 5 x 10-8 were not enriched for directional consistency in allelic associations with T2D (48.2 vs 50% expected, binomial test P = 0.79).
0	NA	CHD	NA	RESULTS	Among the loci nominally associated with T2D and CHD (P < 0.05 but excluding P < 5 x 10-8 associations above), 81.8% of the allelic variation associated with both the outcomes in a directionally consistent manner (binomial test P < 10-100).
0	NA	CHD	NA	RESULTS	Furthermore, of the allelic variation that was not associated with both T2D and CHD at a P-value > 0.05, only 50.6% of the allelic variation (compared to 50% expected under the null hypothesis) was associated with the two outcomes in a directionally consistent manner (Table 2).
0	NA	CHD	NA	RESULTS	To rule out any biases introduced due to allelic variations at a limited set of loci associated with both CHD and T2D, we conducted sensitivity analyses using genome-wide variants pruned for LD and found results consistent for an overall enrichment of loci associated with both T2D and CHD in a directionally consistent manner (Supplementary Table 15)
0	Type 2 diabetes	CHD	NA	RESULTS	Motivated by the enrichment of directionally consistent associations of allelic variation between T2D and CHD SNPs, we performed a genome-wide association scan which modeled the joint distribution of association with both T2D and CHD (T2D-CHD, Methods), a test to help improve power for discovery of novel loci that are associated with both the outcomes (Supplementary Figure 5).
0	NA	CHD	NA	RESULTS	After verifying that our test statistic was calibrated (Supplementary Figure 6), we used this approach to identify a set of loci that were associated with both T2D and CHD (both traits with fixed effects meta-analysis P < 10-3), and were overall associated at genome-wide levels of significance (bivariate P < 5 x 10-8, Supplementary Table 16).
0	NA	CHD	NA	RESULTS	19 loci met these criteria, which included many established loci for T2D or CHD
0	NA	CCDC92	NA	RESULTS	We identified one association near CCDC92 (bivariate P = 2.7 x 10-9, Supplementary Figure 7a).
0	NA	CHD	rs825476	RESULTS	The sentinel variant (rs825476) was associated with both T2D (fixed effects meta-analysis P = 2.2 x 10-6) and CHD (fixed effects meta-analysis P = 2.9 x 10-7) (Supplementary Figure 7b and 7c); rs825476-T at this locus increased risk for both the outcomes.
0	NA	NA	rs825476	RESULTS	To demonstrate conclusive association of rs825476 with T2D, we sought additional replication data from 8 additional cohorts, comprising 21,560 T2D cases and 42,814 controls.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We observed marginal replication for this variant in those data alone (OR = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01 - 1.07; fixed effects meta-analysis P = 5.5 x 10-3), and obtained genome-wide significance when combined with the previous data (OR = 1.04, 95% CI: CI: 1.03 - 1.06; fixed effects meta-analysis P = 4.3 x 10-8), Supplementary Figure 7b).
0	Type 2 diabetes	NA	NA	RESULTS	Analyses conditioned on the lead SNP accounted for all the residual joint T2D-CHD association in the region (Methods), indicated that the underlying genetic associations for both endpoints co-localize to a shared genetic risk factor potentially tagged by the sentinel SNP (Supplementary Figure 8).
0	NA	CCDC92	NA	RESULTS	rs825476-T allele also increased the expression of CCDC92 in the subcutaneous adipose tissue (Supplementary Table 6) in eQTL analyses conducted in the MuTHER consortium and GTEx [8,9], suggesting a possible candidate gene for the association
0	NA	CHD	NA	RESULTS	We sought to reduce our list to a subset of loci that co-localized the T2D and CHD associations to a single underlying genetic risk variant by conducting formal co-localization analyses (Methods).
0	NA	CHD	NA	RESULTS	8 of these 19 met this criterion, and at 7 of those 8 loci, the risk allele for T2D also increased the risk for CHD (Table 3).
1	NA	TCF7L2	NA	RESULTS	This included loci with known associations with T2D (TCF7L2, HNF1A, and CTRB1/2) as well as previously unreported T2D loci reported here (MIR17HG and CCDC92), or known association with CHD (MRAS and ZC3HC1).
0	NA	HNF1A	rs1169288	RESULTS	Interestingly, this set of directionally consistent loci included coding variants in two transcription factors: the missense variant(s) I27L in HNF1A, and R326H in ZC3HC1.
1	NA	apolipoprotein E	rs4420638	RESULTS	At the APOE locus, where the effect of association for T2D and CHD risk was opposite, localization was observed at rs4420638, but the tagging among the lead sentinel SNPs was incomplete, making it challenging to distinguish between multiple conditionally independent variant associations with both traits versus partial tagging of a single, common association.
0	NA	IRS1	rs7578326	RESULTS	At the IRS1 locus, while we found rs7578326 to be associated with both T2D and CHD (P < 5 x 10-8), formal co-localization analyses failed to identify a single underlying genetic risk factor for the two outcomes at this locus
1	NA	CHD	NA	RESULTS	Next, we used biomarker data to help understand the mechanisms linking T2D and CHD at two novel loci discovered through bivariate scan, MIR17HG, and CCDC92.
0	NA	CCDC92	rs1727313	RESULTS	The region around CCDC92 segregates numerous cardiometabolic trait associations, including T2D (rs1727313), HDL-C (rs4759375, rs838880), triglycerides (rs4765127), and waist-hip ratio adjusted for body mass index (rs4765219).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	However, variants in these previous reports were not strongly linked to our sentinel SNP (r2 < 0.02 in all cases).
0	Type 2 diabetes	CCDC92	rs10773049	RESULTS	The risk variant for T2D-CHD at the CCDC92 locus also decreased HDL-C levels (fixed effects meta-analysis P = 2.2 x 10-9) in analyses by the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium (GLGC); this variant was in partial linkage with a variant (rs10773049, r2 = 0.6 and 0.3 in Europe and South Asia, respectively) previously known for association with body mass index.
1	NA	MIR17HG	NA	RESULTS	MIR17HG appeared to harbor only modest associations with HDL (fixed effects meta-analysis P = 1.3 x 10-4), fasting insulin levels (P = 6.4 x 10-4) and HOMA-IR (P = 7.9 x 10-4)
1	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	RESULTS	We also examined association at APOE where the T2D risk allele was associated with decreased CHD risk.
0	neovascular disease	LDL-C	NA	RESULTS	The T2D risk allele was also found associated with increased HDL-C (fixed effects meta-analysis P = 1.72 x 10-21), decreased LDL-C (P = 1.51 x 10-178), decreased total cholesterol (P = 1.14 x 10-149), decreased triglycerides (P = 1.55 x 10-14), reduced LDL particle size (P = 3.80 x 10-11), increased waist-hip ratio (P = 1.80 x 10-6, BMI-adjusted), and neovascular disease (P = 2.78 x 10-8)
0	Type 2 diabetes	NA	NA	RESULTS	We next aimed to identify a subset of highly connected loci that indicate unidentified pathways that jointly related to T2D-CHD.
0	Type 2 diabetes	NA	NA	RESULTS	To achieve this, we used results from our bivariate T2D-CHD association scan and pruned SNPs for LD to obtain a set of unlinked regions across the genome (r2 < 0.05).
0	Type 2 diabetes	GRAIL	NA	RESULTS	From this list, we selected 299 LD independent SNPs that were found associated with T2D-CHD in our bivariate scan (P < 0.001, Supplementary Table 17 and 18) and sought to prioritize candidate genes implicated in the association using the text-mining approach, GRAIL.
0	NA	GRAIL	NA	RESULTS	79 out of 299 regions were found to have prioritized specific genes in associated intervals (GRAIL P < 0.05), significantly more overall than expected (26.4%, binomial test P < 10-34).
0	NA	p<10-4	NA	RESULTS	Next, protein-protein interaction connectivity analysis among these 79 genes demonstrates more direct and indirect connections than expected (permuted P < 10-4, Methods), thus motivating us to focus on this subset for further analysis.
0	NA	SLC2A2	NA	RESULTS	Several plausible candidates from this list emerge, including the hepatic glucose transporter SLC2A2, the Adipocyte fatty-acid-binding protein aP2, Lipin-1, PGC-1beta, and the Free fatty acid receptor 1 FFAR1, among others (Supplementary Table 18)
0	Type 2 diabetes	NA	NA	RESULTS	We next performed ontology analysis on the set of 79 genes that emerged from T2D-CHD bivariate scan for connectivity.
0	NA	CHD	NA	RESULTS	To compare our findings, we also conducted similar ontological analysis on loci identified for T2D or CHD in previous GWAS for each of these traits.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	RESULTS	As expected, ontological analysis of established T2D loci alone indicated robust enrichment of diabetes, hyperglycemia, and insulin resistance disease annotations (enrichment test P < 10-55), as well as enrichment for pathways related to insulin secretion and transport, glucose homeostasis, and pancreas development (all P < 10-9).
0	coronary artery disease	CHD	NA	RESULTS	Also as expected, ontological analysis of CHD loci alone demonstrated robust enrichment of disease annotations related to coronary disease, myocardial infarction, and arteriosclerosis (P < 10-36), as well as enrichment for pathways related to lipid homeostasis and cholesterol transport (P < 10-8).
0	cardiovascular disease	p<10-5	NA	RESULTS	As expected, the analysis of the 79 T2D-CHD associated gene intervals identified loci that were also modestly enriched for disease ontologies related to vascular resistance (P < 10-12), T2D, cardiovascular disease, fatty liver, obesity, gestational hypertension, and Pre-eclampsia (all P < 10-5), as well as cancer (P < 10-9).
0	NA	P<10-7	NA	RESULTS	But in contrast to the pathways described above, we also observed enrichment for additional pathways related to cardiovascular system development, cell signaling, signal transduction, regulation of phosphorylation, and transmembrane receptor protein kinase signaling among the categories (adjusted P < 10-7) (Supplementary Figure 9)
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We report the discovery of 17 novel loci for T2D using discovery and replication studies in 265,678 participants.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Using exome-chip data, we were able to identify a coding variant which was more strongly associated with T2D risk than the corresponding common variant.
1	NA	CHD	NA	DISCUSS	Using additional data on 260,365 participants, we report a novel locus for CHD, and identify genetic loci that are shared between T2D and CHD of which a subset co-localized to the same genetic variant (e.g., CCDC92, MIR17HG, HNF1A, ZC3HC1, APOE, Table 3).
0	Type 2 diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Finally, using a bivariate scan for T2D-CHD, genetic association data pointed to new pathways that are implicated in the etiology of both the disease outcomes
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Many of the loci discovered in the current meta-analyses suggest novel T2D biology or confirm pathways previously implicated in T2D.

0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Genetic variants near KL have also been shown associated with fasting glucose levels as well.
0	immunological disorders	TMEM18	NA	DISCUSS	TMEM18 is involved in cellular migration; HLA-DR5 and CMIP play crucial roles in immune mediated responses and have been implicated in various immunological disorders.
0	insulin-treated diabetes	NA	rs9272346	DISCUSS	Genetic variation at the HLA locus (rs9272346) has been previously implicated in type-1 diabetes (T1D); however, we did not find any evidence of association of rs9272346 with T2D in our meta-analyses.
1	NA	NA	rs9272346	DISCUSS	Additionally, rs9272346 was not in LD with the T2D sentinel SNP (rs2050188) at this locus (r2 = 0.06 in EUR and r2 = 0.01 in SA).
0	NA	NA	rs7111341	DISCUSS	However, rs7111341 has been previously reported as a risk factor for T1D.
0	NA	CTRB1	NA	DISCUSS	We found that rs7111341-T is associated with increased risk for T2D, but decreased risk for T1D, a similar pattern of association to a previously established association (rs7202877, nearby CTRB1)
1	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	DISCUSS	The contrasting associations of APOE with T2D and CHD were puzzling.
1	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	DISCUSS	APOE encodes apolipoprotein-E found in the chylomicron and intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDLs).
1	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	DISCUSS	Genetic variation at the APOE locus is associated with major lipids and CHD.
0	NA	CHD	NA	DISCUSS	Here, the T2D risk variant was associated with decreased CHD risk and LDL-C, and reduced LDL particle size.
0	NA	LDL-C	NA	DISCUSS	These observations are consistent with recent studies indicating that reduction in LDL-C levels, a major CHD risk factor, may confer a higher risk of T2D.
0	NA	LDL-C	NA	DISCUSS	Evidence from a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials has shown that reduction of LDL-C by statin treatment, compared to placebo, led to a higher, but a very small absolute, risk of T2D.
0	NA	HMG-CoA reductase	NA	DISCUSS	Moreover, genetic variants associated with reduced expression of HMG-CoA reductase, the target of statins, and reduced LDL-C levels have been shown associated with increased risk of T2D.
0	NA	LDL-C	NA	DISCUSS	Also, two MR studies concluded that genetically mediated decreases in LDL-C associated with a higher risk of T2D.
0	NA	PCSK9	NA	DISCUSS	Furthermore, it has been shown that genetic variants in the PCSK9 gene that lower LDL-C levels associated with a higher risk of T2D, fasting glucose concentration, body weight, and waist-to-hip ratio.
0	NA	LDL-C	NA	DISCUSS	In contrast to the findings from our overall meta-analyses, these results suggest that LDL-C may represent one of a small subset of discrete pathways that display opposing associations for the two outcomes.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	These findings underscore how human genetics can help focus future investigations on T2D therapeutics that have either neutral or beneficial effects on vascular outcomes
