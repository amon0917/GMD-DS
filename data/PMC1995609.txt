0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Breast and prostate cancer are the two most frequently diagnosed cancers in the United States and result in substantial morbidity and mortality.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	A number of breast and prostate cancer susceptibility genes and chromosomal regions have been identified.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, currently known genes account for only a fraction of the familial aggregation of breast cancer and few prostate cancer susceptibility genes have even been identified.
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Risk for these cancers is likely mediated through variation in many genes, each conferring a relatively small risk for the disease.
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Genome-wide association studies provide an opportunity to discover novel genes and pathways that play a causal role in cancer occurrence and in turn may lead to new therapies for the prevention and treatment of cancer.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Finding genetic associations with breast and prostate cancer risk that are robust across multiple studies may facilitate the identification of high risk individuals who can be targeted for early screening and preventive interventions
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We report GWAS results for breast cancer and prostate cancer phenotypes in a community-based sample of adults from two generations of the same families.
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Although none of the SNP associations achieved genome-wide significance in GEE or FBAT models, this resource has the potential to detect novel cancer susceptibility genes and to explore the relevance of promising candidate gene associations to human cancer.
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our results can be compared to those from other genome-wide association studies such as the National Cancer Institute's CGEMS.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Although the two studies used different genotyping platforms limiting overlap in the SNPs examined, we were able to determine the physical position of the SNPs.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	rs2371438	DISCUSS	Using this strategy, SNPs in the ERRB4 gene (CGEMS DSSNP_ID rs2371438 and FHS 100K SNP rs10497958) were associated with prostate cancer.
0	cancers	ErbB	NA	DISCUSS	ErbB proteins are widely expressed in prostate cells and may play a role in tumor development, growth and progression in human prostate cancer.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We also examined the 8q24 region previously associated with prostate cancer risk.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	rs6983267	DISCUSS	CGEMS investigators recently reported a second independent risk SNP (rs6983267) within the 8q24 strongly associated with prostate cancer.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The Affymetrix 100K GeneChip did not include either of the previously reported risk SNPs; however, we did identify five other SNPs in this region associated with prostate cancer.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The underlying biologic mechanism mediating prostate cancer risk associated with the SNPs and chromosomal region remains unknown.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	A two-stage approach, genome-wide association followed by selective genotyping of SNPs with suggestive evidence of association, may provide an efficient strategy for pursuing initial genome-wide results
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Several important limitations merit comment.
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	First, this study used cancer cases identified through surveillance of a multigenerational community-based sample.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The enrollment and examination of Original Cohort and Offspring Cohort participants began years before DNA collection occurred.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Thus, a survival bias may have been introduced.
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our cases may be comprised of early-staged and less lethal cancers.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	To address this potential bias, we adjusted for covariates using the full Framingham sample, and used the residual traits for the subset of individuals genotyped using the 100K Affymetrix GeneChip to test for association with the SNPs in linear regression models.
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Residual traits from Cox models typically are not ideally distributed for linear regression models, but our adjustment method using the full Framingham sample precludes the testing of SNP associations with cancer traits using Cox models.
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Second, we had a small number of cancer events (250 all cancer cases, 58 breast cancer cases and 59 prostate cancer cases) limiting our ability to detect SNP associations.
0	NA	CFH	NA	DISCUSS	In a recent small GWAS of age-related macular degeneration that included 96 cases and 50 controls, an association with the CFH gene was identified and confirmed in larger studies.
0	NA	CFH	NA	DISCUSS	However, in that report, individuals homozygous for the CFH risk allele had a sevenfold increased likelihood of age-related macular degeneration.
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	It is very unlikely that common genetic variants for cancer phenotypes will confer a risk for cancer susceptibility of that magnitude.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	For example, the odds ratio associated with the risk marker identified for prostate cancer in region 8q24 was 1.72 in the combined Icelandic sample.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Furthermore, the associations between prostate cancer and the SNPs with low minor allele frequency (Table 5) are likely to be false positive associations given the small number of prostate cancer cases in our sample.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Third, the 100K Affymetrix GeneChip provides limited coverage of the genome; many of our a priori candidate genes did not have any SNP coverage on the chip and coverage of some candidate genes that were present on the chip was suboptimal.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	rs1447295	DISCUSS	Importantly, the replicated risk SNP, rs1447295, for prostate cancer was not included on the chip.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	NHLBI has committed funds for a 550 K genome-wide scan on all FHS participants.
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This will enable us to confirm our initial 100K SNP associations in a larger sample with a greater number of cancer cases and with denser coverage of the genome.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We did not examine epistasis or gene-environment interactions which may modify the associations noted in this study.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Lastly, most of our associations are likely to be due to chance.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Replication studies are needed to determine if any of the results we report are indicative of true associations.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	It is important that our data be used in conjunction with data from other samples given the high probability of false positive associations
0	cancers	NA	NA	CONCL	In summary, the untargeted genome-wide approach to detect genetic associations for cancer traits provides an opportunity to identify novel biologic pathways related to cancer occurrence and to direct future study of candidate genes that hold the most promise for relevance to cancer risk in humans.
