0	diabetes	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	We investigated three groups of traits: (1) endophenotypes such as blood glucose, blood pressure, lipids, hematocrit, and body mass index, (2) time-to-event outcomes such as the age-at-onset of diabetes mellitus (DM), cancer, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), and (3) both combined.

0	cancers	NA	NA	INTRO	Common age-related diseases including cancer, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), diabetes mellitus (DM), and neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia are major contributors to morbidity and mortality at old age.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The underlying hypothesis in gerontology posits that these devastating diseases share some common mechanisms in intrinsic processes of aging that remain to be determined (Kaeberlein et al.,).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Identifying genetic variants associated with multiple age-related diseases (i.e., pleiotropic effects) is a fundamental step toward understanding the genetic contribution to age-related processes.
0	cancers	NA	NA	INTRO	Numerous loci have been identified to show association across distinct diseases such as immune-related disorders, cancer and NDs, highlighting the common underlying biological pathways in the etiology of these complex diseases (Sivakumaran et al.,).
0	Alzheimer's disease	apolipoprotein E	NA	INTRO	For example, variants in APOE significantly associated with longevity and lifespan also confer risk of CVDs, AD and cancer (Ewbank,; Christensen et al.,; Brooks-Wilson,; Kulminski et al.,).
0	Crohn's disease	PTPN22	NA	INTRO	A putative loss of function variant in PTPN22 has been found to reduce the risk of Crohn's disease but to increase the risk of rheumatoid arthritis and DM (Plenge et al.,; Todd et al.,; Barrett et al.,).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	On the other hand, evidence suggests that many age-related diseases are associated with a variety of intermediate phenotypes (also called endophenotypes, i.e., a hereditary characteristic that normally relates to some condition but is not a direct symptom per se) such as body mass index (BMI), lipids, etc.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	It has been noted from previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that different diseases and endophenotypes can be linked by shared genetic variants (Li et al.,).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	These observations demonstrate the clinical benefits from characterization of shared genetic causes that have pleiotropic effects on different phenotypes related to aging.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Thus, there has been an increasing interest in jointly interrogating the cross-phenotype association of genetic variants
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Pleiotropic analysis generally provide more information on the common underlying biological mechanism and guidance of further functional studies (Solovieff et al.,; Price et al.,).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In many cases, considering multiple phenotypes together boosts statistical power by aggregating marginal effects on individual phenotypes.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with moderate causal effects on each phenotype may happen not to reach significance when interrogating them separately.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Multi-trait analysis has been demonstrated to yield enhanced statistical power for detecting the quantitative trait loci (QTL) that are associated with multiple traits (Korol et al.,).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Moreover, once genetic pleiotropy is identified, it is of interest to further discriminate between a biological and mediated pleiotropy (Solovieff et al.,).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The former refers to a direct independent biological effect of a variant on more than one phenotype, while the latter refers to a situation in which the effect on one phenotype is mediated by another phenotype so that the variant is indirectly associated with the second.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Given the identified genetic variant having pleiotropic effect on a pair of phenotypes, causal inference under certain specific assumptions can provide insights into potential causal pathways and contribute to characterizing the underlying biological mechanisms.
0	acute myocardial infarction	NA	NA	INTRO	For example, given the causal relationship between low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and myocardial infarction (MI), conducting mediation analysis on a variant associated with both can provide evidence of which pathological pathway the variant is probably involved in.
0	seizures	NA	NA	INTRO	Finally, it should be noted that although previous GWAS following the traditional biomedical strategy have attempted to discover genes conferring risks of age-related diseases, the SNPs associated with them in general are not subject to direct evolutionary selection as these diseases occur during the post-reproductive period so that these SNPs hardly contribute to fitness (Nesse et al.,).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Therefore, any effect of such SNPs on the diseases is probably mediated through their effects on certain endophenotypes or is modulated by environmental factors (e.g., the grandmother effect; Lahdenpera et al.,).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Consequently, effects of relevant variants are often found to be environment-specific and to have different temporal patterns (De Benedictis and Franceschi,; Kulminski,; Yashin et al.,).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In this case, pleiotropic analysis combined with follow-up mediation analysis and annotation with various expression and regulatory database resources can serve as a substantive tool to elucidate the potential mediator and causality behind the association between SNPs and age-related diseases, which may explain inconsistent genetic effects in different populations even in case of populations of the same ancestry and perfectly harmonized phenotypes (Kulminski,; Yashin et al.,)
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Over the past decade, GWAS have seen unprecedented success; however, most studies focused on individual phenotypes.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	While approximately >10,000 genome-wide significant SNPs have been identified to be associated with various phenotypes, studies for identifying genetic pleiotropy of age-related diseases and endophenotypes still lag behind.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In recent years, a handful of statistical frameworks based on multivariate or univariate approaches have been proposed (Solovieff et al.,).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Multivariate models are one of the extensively adopted approaches that have been proposed to deal with multiple phenotypes in a unified framework (O'Reilly et al.,; Shriner,).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Multivariate approaches take into account phenotypic correlation but often have some limitations in the context of meta-analysis and drawbacks of being incapable of handling phenotypes of different types.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	For example, it may suffer from reduced statistical power due to removal of subjects with missing values in any phenotype.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	When searching for the pleiotropy between age-related diseases and endophenotypes, we often face the problem of combining time-to-event outcomes and quantitative or binary traits.
0	van der Waals	NA	NA	INTRO	In this situation, univariate approaches based on p-values (Fisher,; van der Sluis et al.,) or summary statistics (Xu et al.,; Zhu et al.,) exhibit unique advantages in terms of both statistical power and flexibility.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In particular, pleiotropic analysis by systematically combining summary statistics based on existing GWAS results that also takes into account phenotype correlation can be a fast and simple solution to this issue (Zhu et al.,)
0	cancers	NA	NA	INTRO	In this study, we aim at identifying SNPs that exhibit effects on multiple endophenotypes and age-related diseases including CVDs, cancer, DM and NDs by performing a pleiotropic meta-analysis based on five National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded large-scale longitudinal datasets.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We use a slightly modified strategy based on (Zhu et al.,) to combine summary statistics from univariate association studies that takes into account the correlation between the statistics for the endophenotypes and diseases.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	For each newly identified variant that passes a pre-specified significance threshold, we explore its biological implication and regulatory role by performing follow-up functional annotation and examining Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) (The ENCODE Project Consortium,) and Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx) (Lonsdale et al.,) databases.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	This helps detect spurious pleiotropy that may result from linkage disequilibrium (LD) with two causal variants in different genes affecting different endophenotypes or diseases (Solovieff et al.,).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We further conduct age-dependent time-to-event analyses to investigate temporal patterns of the effects.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	To distinguish two different types of pleiotropy, we perform a follow-up mediation analysis using a marginal structural model.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In particular, to provide more insight into the plausible causal pathways, we focus on studying whether or how much the effect of an identified SNP on an associated disease is mediated through a specific endophenotype

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	For the SNPs that were selected as candidates from ARIC (described in the following subsection) and were missing in the other studies, we imputed the genotypes with IMPUTE2 (Howie et al.,) according to a 1000 Genomes Project Phase I reference panel.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Within each study, those SNPs with an imputation information score < 0.8 were excluded from the analyses
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	To narrow down the candidates and pre-select promising SNPs, we focused on one of the largest studies ARIC, which shared the same genotyping platform with MESA, and reported a wide spectrum of measured relevant phenotypes and diseases.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Accordingly, we expected larger enrichment of significant SNPs associated with various age-related diseases and related traits in this study compared to the others.

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	An additive genetic coding model was adopted in all the studies performed at the current and following stages.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We computed combined p-values across the endophenotypes and diseases using Fisher's method which did not take into account phenotype correlation and thus at this stage produced less stringent results in most cases.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The SNPs with a p-value exceeding the genome-wide significance threshold (5e-08) were chosen as candidates for the downstream pleiotropic meta-analysis
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	For the selected SNPs, we conducted univariate association analyses separately in each study to obtain summary statistics.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The phenotypes and diseases under investigation in each study are listed in Table 1.
0	CHS	NA	NA	METHODS	We adopted a (generalized) linear mixed-effects model with both individual- and family-level random effects to control for family structure and longitudinal observation correlation in ARIC, FHS, and MESA, and with only an individual-level random effect in CHS which consisted of only independent individuals.
0	HRS	NA	NA	METHODS	We adopted a linear regression model for HRS as we only selected cross-sectional measurements and more than 99% of the samples were independent.
0	NA	Cox	NA	METHODS	We adopted marginal Cox proportional hazards (PH) models to analyze the time-to-event phenotypes with robust estimates of variance (Lin and Wei,) for correcting for family structure.

0	CHS	NA	NA	METHODS	In addition, we included study center as a covariate in ARIC, MESA and CHS, cohort in HRS, and genotyping phase in FHS.
0	HRS	NA	NA	METHODS	We utilized the lmer and lm functions in the lme4 R package (Bates et al.,) for the quantitative analyses, glm for the logistic regression (only for HRS) and the coxph function in the survival R package (Therneau and Lumley,) for the time-to-event analyses.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Log-transformation was performed to correct the skewness of the distribution for certain quantitative phenotypes (Table 1)
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The overall framework of the entire meta-analysis is depicted in the flowchart (Figure 1).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Given that Fisher's method does not account for the correlation between the statistics, inflated p-values were expected in the pre-selection stage as most of our phenotypes were weakly to modestly correlated (Figures S1-S6).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Therefore, we adopted a two-step strategy to compute more accurate meta-analysis combined p-values for the selected SNPs.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	More specifically, suppose that for a certain SNP we observe an estimated effect size  together with its standard error  for the phenotype i (i {1, ..., Kj}) in the study j (j {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}), where Kj is the number of phenotypes in the study j.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	In the first step, following the similar spirit of (Xu et al.,; Bolormaa et al.,; Zhu et al.,), we constructed a general omnibus test statistic  that took into account the correlation of effect sizes between the phenotypes, where  ( and ) and Sigmaj is the correlation matrix to be estimated.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Thus, under the null hypothesis (betaj = 0) and the assumption of a large sample size, the test statistic approximately follows a chi-square distribution with a degree of freedom (DF) of K
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	from which we obtained a combined p-value pj in the study j.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	As independent SNPs are recommended for estimating Sigmaj (Zhu et al.,), we simulated 1000 independent SNPs under HWE based on MAF and estimated the correlation matrix Sigmaj for each study j based on the summary statistics of the simulated SNPs.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We checked the multivariate normality assumption for these summary statistics under the null hypothesis using the Henze-Zirkler test (Henze and Zirkler,), and found no evidence of violation of the assumption.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The endophenotypes included in the pleiotropic analysis are purported to affect the onset of the complex diseases to some extent.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We observed that the majority of the pairwise correlations of the summary statistics from the univariate analysis were lower than 0.3.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	As combining evidence from highly correlated phenotypes is less informative, within each study, we selected a group of phenotypes (Table 1) to ensure that the correlation between any pair of z-scores was less than 0.7 (The correlation matrices of the statistics in the five datasets are depicted in Figures S1-S6).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	A p-value (e.g., pj) that was smaller than a pre-specified threshold led to the rejection of the null hypothesis, indicating that the SNP was associated with at least one of the phenotypes in the study j (i.e.,  i, betaij   0).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Then, we computed a p-value for the meta-analysis using the Fisher's method in which the samples from the six cohorts were treated as independent (we did not observe evident correlation between the summary statistics under the null hypothesis from the two generations in FHS).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Thus, under the null hypothesis (i.e., the SNP was not associated with any phenotype in any study), the test statistic for the meta-analysis followed a chi-square distribution with a DF of 12
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	From which we obtained a meta-analysis p-value pM.

0	NA	NA	NA	FIG	Finally, the p-values from each cohort were combined using Fisher's method
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We first pruned the identified SNPs from the pleiotropic meta-analysis to select independent SNPs to represent adjacent loci in high LD for the follow-up studies.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	LD information for each pair of SNPs was acquired using SNAP (Johnson et al.,) and the identified SNPs on each chromosome were aggregated into groups based on pairwise correlation coefficients of LD (i.e., r2).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	More specifically, a SNP was merged into a group if it was in high LD (r2 > 0.5) with any SNP in the group.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We selected the SNP with the most significant p-value within each group as the proxy.
0	NA	GRASP	NA	METHODS	To highlight novel SNPs for the downstream analyses, we examined the identified proxy loci in the Ensembl database and employed GRASP (Leslie et al.,) to search GWAS catalog data for previously reported associations.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Functional consequences of these identified proxy SNPs were annotated using the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (McLaren et al.,).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	To check whether these SNPs had a plausible role in gene expression, we examined whether they were eQTLs or in LD with eQTLs of associated genes.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We retrieved information on eQTLs in the gene which the SNP is located in or is flanked by from the GTEx database (Lonsdale et al.,) for all available tissues and acquired pairwise LD information using SNAP (Johnson et al.,).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We examined various regulatory features such as DNase clusters, chromatin interactions, DNA methylation, histone modification from the ENCODE database (The ENCODE Project Consortium,) through the UCSC genome browser.
0	allergy	NA	NA	METHODS	We examined variants in high LD (r2 > 0.8) with the identified SNPs in non-coding regions for their functional annotation and the presence of chromatin histone marks, hypersensitive DNase elements and protein binding sites from the ENCODE and Roadmap databases by using the HaploReg v3 software (Ward and Kellis,)
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	In order to ensure that the SNPs identified from the time-to-event analysis satisfied the PH assumption and explore their potential age-dependent effects, we checked the model fitting based on the correlation coefficient between transformed survival time and the scaled Schoenfeld residuals (Grambsch and Therneau,).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We declared the violation if the p-value from the cox.zph function in the survival R package was < 0.05.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Any violation of the PH assumption indicated the existence of age-dependent effects, and for such SNPs we acquired an overall picture of its dynamics of the age-dependent effect by utilizing the timecox function in the timereg R package (Martinussen and Scheike,), in which we assumed that the counting process started at the age of 40 as data is modeled by a counting process representation in this method.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Other covariates such as sex that did not violate the PH assumption were treated as constants and a cluster-based resampling method was used to correct for the family structure.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Based on the produced temporal pattern of the dynamic effects, we further performed stratification analyses to investigate the specific effects in each age group
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	For the SNPs identified to be associated with both the endophenotypes and complex diseases, we performed mediation analysis to investigate whether the pleiotropic effect is mediated by the endophenotypes (natural indirect effect) or through other unspecified mechanisms (natural direct effect).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The rationale of the mediation analysis is illustrated in the causal graph (Figure 2).
0	cancers	NA	NA	METHODS	In the longitudinal data, we chose the measurement at the baseline of an endophenotype as a mediator, which ruled out the possibility of reverse causality for most diseases (except cancer) as the measurements occurred well before the onset of diseases.

0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Because of these, the replication of a significant association in other cohorts is not straightforward.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The lack of some replications may also suggest that the effects of age-related loci are more sensitive to environment such as age as many of the identified SNPs have age-dependent effects.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In addition, in terms of the statistical power of the omnibus test, the inclusion of many endophenotypes reduces the chance to detect the SNPs that are only associated with a small proportion of phenotypes.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Methods with adaptive weights on different phenotypes might identify more signals in this case.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Another problem is that although we assumed that there were no other unmeasured confounders than the included covariates underlying the endophenotypes at the baseline and the onset of the complex diseases, it is still possible that these confounders exist, and in this case, the estimated mediation effect would be biased (Pearl,).
0	DM	NA	rs7081476	DISCUSS	For example, we observed an indirect effect but no direct effect of rs7081476 on DM that was mediated through HbA1c.
0	DM	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, the no-confounder assumption was probably violated for HbA1c and DM as it has been shown that the association of HbA1c with DM may be explained by its biomarker for the presence and severity of hyperglycemia (Lyons and Basu,)
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In conclusion, we identified seven novel loci that exhibit pleiotropic effects on a variety of endophenotypes and age-related diseases using five large-scale longitudinal cohorts.
0	Inflammation Laboratory's JDRF	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The enrichment of identified pleiotropic variants involved in immune system and inflammation supports the hypothesis of shared pathological role of infection and inflammation in chronic age-related diseases.
0	DM	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The findings indicating the potential regulatory involvement of these genetic variants in a diversity of functions contribute to the understanding of the shared mechanisms underlying comorbidity and the relationship between anthropometry, lipid- and blood-related traits, CVDs, DM, and NDs.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our results suggest that the effects on the risk of CVDs often follow different age-dependent patterns and are probably through angiogenesis.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	These findings are valuable for guiding follow-up analyses and provide evidence for further scrutinizing the molecular mechanisms and implication of the relevant genes in the age-related diseases
