0	lung adenocarcinomas	ALKBH3	NA	DISCUSS	Among them, ALKBH3 was reported to be significantly overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma cells and contributes to NSCLC cell survival, although combined treatment modalities with cisplatin- and lentivirus-mediated ALKBH2 downregulation were significantly more potent in inhibiting lung cell growth and inducing apoptosis than monochemotherapy.
1	NSCLC	ALKBH1	NA	DISCUSS	However, little is known for the role of ALKBH1 in NSCLC survival and/or therapy response

0	NA	NA	rs7629386	DISCUSS	rs7629386 is relatively rare in Chinese (MAF =0.07) but common in Caucasians (MAF =0.31); therefore, the combined P value for all participants was only 1.24 x 10-2 in the additive model.

0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The reasons for the discrepancy may be as follows: First, marker SNPs might be different between ethnic populations (because of different allele frequency and LD structure).
0	NSCLC	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Second, the demographic and clinic characteristics of Chinese NSCLC patients were different from those in the Harvard cohort (gender, stage, smoking rate, and histologic types) and these factors are survival related.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Finally, the relatively small sample size in each participant studies may yield insufficient power.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The real causative SNPs need to be identified by fine mapping and comparative analyses on both Chinese and Caucasian populations

0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Second, we used a 3-stage study design with 4 independent cohorts.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	SNPs that are associated with overall survival across all study populations have a high probability of being true-positive findings, thus reducing the need for strict multiple comparison correction.
0	NSCLC	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Third, we identified 5 candidate SNPs as marker SNPs for Chinese, suggesting important biologic pathways, and largely improved current notions on NSCLC survival.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Several limitations of our study also need to be addressed.
0	NSCLC	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Considering the heterogeneity in genetic background and treatment to NSCLC between the Han Chinese and Caucasian populations, the validation power might be limited in replication II.
0	NA	NA	rs7629386	DISCUSS	Another limitation of the study is that the effect of SNP rs7629386 might be unstable because of low frequency of homozygote when a HR of 3.92 was observed in Han population but the HR was much lower at 1.50 in Caucasian population.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Finally, eQTL analysis did not reveal significant findings.
