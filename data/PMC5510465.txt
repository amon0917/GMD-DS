0	cancers	NA	NA	INTRO	Lung cancer continues to be the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Although tobacco smoking is the main risk factor, the heritability of lung cancer has been estimated at 18%.
1	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have previously identified several lung cancer susceptibility loci including CHRNA3/5, TERT, HLA, BRCA2, CHEK2, but most of its heritability remains unexplained.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	With the goal of conducting a comprehensive characterization of common lung cancer genetic susceptibility loci, we undertook additional genotyping of lung cancer cases and controls using the OncoArray genotyping platform, which queried 517,482 SNPs chosen for fine mapping of susceptibility to common cancers as well as for de novo discovery (Supplementary Table 1, and Online Methods).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	All participants gave an informed consent, and each study obtained local ethics committee approval.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	After quality control filters (Online Methods), a total of 14,803 cases and 12,262 controls of European ancestry were retained and underwent imputation techniques to infer additional genotypes for genetic variants included in the 1000 Genomes Project data (Online Methods).
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Logistic regression was then used to assess the association between variants (n=10,439,017 SNPs) and lung cancer risk, as well as by predominant histological types and by smoking behavior (Online Methods).
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Fixed-effects models (Online Methods) were used to combine the OncoArray results with previously published lung cancer GWAS, allowing for analysis of 29,266 patients and 56,450 controls of European descent (Table 1).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	There were no signs of genomic inflation overall or for any subtypes (Supplementary Figure 1) indicating little evidence for confounding by cryptic population structure (Online Methods).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	All findings with a P-value less than 1x10-5 are reported in Supplementary Table 2.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	As shown in Figure 1, the genetic architecture of lung cancer varies markedly among histological subtypes, with striking differences between lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma.
0	SCLC	NA	NA	INTRO	Manhattan plots for small cell carcinoma (SCLC), ever and never smoking are displayed in Supplementary Figure 2.
0	squamous disease	NA	NA	INTRO	The array heritability estimates were comparable among histological subsets, but squamous cell carcinoma appeared to share more genetic architecture with small cell carcinoma (SCLC) than with adenocarcinoma (Supplementary Table 3)
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Table 2 presents summary results of all loci with sentinel variants (defined as the variant with the lowest P-value at each locus) that reached genome-wide significance (P-value < 5x10-8) for lung cancer overall and by histological subtypes.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Sentinel variants stratified by new and previous genotyping and additional statistical significance assessed based on the number of effective tests, Approximate Bayes Factors, and Bayesian False Discovery Probability are presented in Supplementary Tables 4 and 5, respectively.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Repeat genotyping of 12% of the OncoArray genotyped samples confirmed the fidelity of the genotyping or imputation for the risk loci, and showed excellent concordance of imputation for SNPs with MAF>0.05 (Online Methods, Supplementary note).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Among the 18 loci that reached GWAS significance, 10 had not reached significance in a genome-wide scan (Figure 1).
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Of these, four novel loci were associated with lung cancer overall, and six with adenocarcinoma
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	To decipher the association between these 18 loci and lung cancer risk, we further investigated their association with gene expression level in normal lung tissues (n=1,425) (Supplementary Table 6, Supplementary Figure 3), genomic annotations (Supplementary Table 7), smoking propensity (cigarettes smoked per day (n=91,046) and Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence metrics (n=17,074)) (Table 2).
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Previous studies have shown shared risk for lung cancer and COPD through inflammation and ROS pathways; therefore, we also assessed the association between sentinel SNPs and reduced lung capacity through spirometry measurements (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1], forced vital capacity [FVC], n =30,199) (Table 2 and Online Methods)
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Variants at 4 novel loci (1p31.1, 6q27, 8p21, 15q21.1) were associated with lung cancer risk overall, with little evidence for heterogeneity among subtypes (Supplementary Figure 4).
0	NA	NA	rs71658797	INTRO	The 1p31.1 locus, recently identified in a pathway-based analysis of the TRICL data, represented by rs71658797 (Odds Ratio [OR]=1.14, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.09-1.18, P-value=3.25 x 10-11), is located near FUBP1/DNAJB4 (Supplementary Figure 4).
1	lung cancer	NA	rs6920364	INTRO	At 6q27, rs6920364 was associated with lung cancer risk with an OR of 1.07 (95% CI 1.04-1.09, P-value=2.9x10-8) with little heterogeneity found by smoking status (Supplementary Figure 4).
0	NA	RNASET2	NA	INTRO	This locus is predicted to regulate RNASET2 (Supplementary Figure 5, Supplementary Table 7).
1	lung cancer	RNASET2	rs6920364	INTRO	We identified rs6920364 as a lung cis-eQTL for RNASET2, an extracellular ribonuclease, in all five cohorts tested (Supplementary Table 6), with increased lung cancer risk correlating with increased RNASET2 expression (Figure 2).
1	Crohn's disease	NA	rs6920364	INTRO	Variants correlated with rs6920364 (r2>0.88) have been noted in GWAS of Crohn's disease and inflammatory bowel disease
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	The 8p21 locus has been suggested as a lung cancer susceptibility locus by pathway analysis and now confirmed at GWAS significance level.
1	lung cancer	NA	rs11780471	INTRO	It is a complex locus represented by sentinel variant rs11780471 associated with lung cancer (OR=0.87, 95% CI 0.83-0.91, P-value=1.69x10-8) (Supplementary Figure 4), but this region contained additional uncorrelated variants (pairwise r2< 0.10) associated with lung cancer (Supplementary Table 8).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Multivariate analysis was consistent with multiple susceptibility alleles at this locus (Supplementary Table 8).
1	lung cancer	CHRNA2	NA	INTRO	In contrast to lung tissue (Figure 3A, Supplementary Table 6, Supplementary Figure 3), we noted that the alleles associated with lung cancer tended to be associated with cerebellum expression of CHRNA2, a member of the cholinergic nicotinic receptor (Figure 3B).
1	NA	CHRNA2	rs11780471	INTRO	The CHRNA2 rs11780471 cis-eQTL effect in the brain was limited to the cerebellum (Figure 3C), a region not traditionally linked with addictive behavior, but where an emerging role is suggested.
1	NA	NA	rs11780471	INTRO	We therefore investigated rs11780471 in the context of smoking behavior (Supplementary Methods).
1	NA	CHRNA5	rs55781567	INTRO	Unlike the well-described 15q25.1 (rs55781567) CHRNA5 locus (Table 2), rs11780471 was not associated with number of cigarettes smoked per day or the FTND metrics (Figure 3D).
1	lung cancer	NA	rs11780471	INTRO	Nevertheless, lung cancer risk allele carriers of rs11780471 tended to be smokers and initiated smoking at earlier ages (Figure 3D), implying that this variant's association with lung cancer could potentially be mediated via influencing aspects of smoking behavior.
1	metabolic disorder	EPHX2	NA	INTRO	Another potentially relevant gene in this region is EPHX2, a xenobiotic metabolism gene.
1	NA	EPHX2	NA	INTRO	Although the sentinel variant is not an eQTL for EPHX2 in lung tissues, other associated variants in the region are (e.g.
0	lung cancer	NA	rs146729428	INTRO	rs146729428, p-value of 1.77x10-7 (Supplementary Table 2) and 5 x 10-4 for lung cancer risk and eQTL, respectively).
1	lung cancer	EPHX2	NA	INTRO	A potential synergistic role of both EPHX2 and CHRNA2 on lung cancer etiology cannot be excluded
1	lung cancer	NA	rs66759488	INTRO	The genetic locus at 15q21 (rs66759488) was shown to be associated with lung cancer (OR=1.07, 95% CI 1.04-1.10, p=2.83x10-8) overall and across lung cancer histologies (Supplementary Figure 4).
1	NA	SEMA6D	rs66759488	INTRO	Genomic annotation suggests that genetic variants correlated with rs66759488 may influence the SEMA6D gene (Supplementary Table 7), but there was no clear eQTL effect (Supplementary Table 6), and this variant did not appear to have a major influence on smoking propensity or lung function (Table 2)
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	For specific lung cancer histology subtypes, we identified 6 novel loci associated with lung adenocarcinoma (15q21, 8p12, 10q24, 20q13.33, 11q23.3 and 9p21.3) (Table 2).
1	NA	SECISBP2L	rs77468143	INTRO	The locus at 15q21 (rs77468143, OR=0.86, 95% CI 0.82-0.89, p=1.15x10-16) is predicted to target SECISBP2L (Supplementary Figure 5), and expression analysis indicated rs77468143 to be a cis-eQTL for SECISBP2L in lung tissue in all eQTL cohorts tested (Supplementary Table 6).
1	lung cancer	SECISBP2L	NA	INTRO	The genetic risk allele appears to correlate with decreased expression levels of SECISBP2L (Figure 2, Supplementary Figure 5), an observation that is consistent with SECISBP2L being down regulated in lung cancers.
1	lung inflammation	NA	rs77468143	INTRO	rs77468143 was nominally associated with lung function (Table 2), potentially implicating inflammation of lung as part of the mechanism at this locus
0	lung adenocarcinomas	NRG1	rs4236709	INTRO	At 8p12, expression analysis indicated that the alleles associated with lung adenocarcinoma (represented by the sentinel variant rs4236709 (Table 2)), also appear to be a lung cis-eQTL for the NRG1 gene (Supplementary Table 6, Supplementary Figure 5).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	This region also contains putative regulatory regions (Supplementary Figure 5).
0	lung adenocarcinomas	NRG1	NA	INTRO	Somatic translocations of NRG1 are infrequently observed in lung adenocarcinomas.
0	lung cancer	NRG1	rs4236709	INTRO	While somatic translocations at 8p12 generally take place in never smokers and are linked with ectopic activation of NRG1, rs4236709 was associated with lung cancer in both ever and never smokers (Supplementary Figure 4) and its genetic risk correlated with decreased NRG1 expression (Figure 2).
1	lung adenocarcinomas	ROS1	rs9387479	INTRO	Interestingly, 6q22.1 variants located near ROS1, another gene somatically translocated in lung adenocarcinoma and for which nearby germline variants were associated with never smoking lung adenocarcinoma in Asian women, were associated with lung adenocarcinoma at borderline genome wide significance (rs9387479; OR=0.92, 95% CI 0.89-0.95, p=6.57x10-8) (Supplementary Table 2)
1	lung adenocarcinomas	OBFC1	rs7902587	INTRO	Three of the sentinel variants associated with lung adenocarcinoma are located near genes related to telomere regulation; rs7902587 (10q24) and rs41309931 (20q13.33) near OBFC1 and RTEL1, respectively, and rs2853677 near TERT as previously noted.
0	lung adenocarcinomas	NA	NA	INTRO	The variants at 10q24 associated with lung adenocarcinoma also appear to be associated with telomere length (Supplementary Figure 6).
0	glioma	NA	NA	INTRO	By contrast, and consistent with observations with 20q13.33 variants associated with glioma, the variants associated with telomere length at 20q13.33 were not necessarily those associated with lung adenocarcinoma (Supplementary Figure 6).
0	glioma	NA	NA	INTRO	Nevertheless, more generally the variants associated by GWAS with longer telomere length appear linked with risk of lung adenocarcinoma and glioma, a finding consistent with our expanded analysis here (Supplementary Figure 6)
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We additionally identified a complex locus at 11q23.3.
0	lung adenocarcinomas	NA	rs1056562	INTRO	The sentinel variant rs1056562 (OR=1.11, 95% CI 1.07-1.14, p=2.7x10-10) is more prominently associated with lung adenocarcinoma (Supplementary Figure 4).
0	NA	AMICA1	rs1056562	INTRO	rs1056562 was correlated with expression of two genes at this locus, AMICA1 and MPZL3 (Supplementary Table 6).
0	lung adenocarcinomas	AMICA1	NA	INTRO	However, there did not appear to be a consistent relationship between the alleles related with AMICA1 and MPZL3 gene expression and those with lung adenocarcinoma (Figure 2, Supplementary Table 9), suggesting that expression of these genes alone is unlikely to mediate this association
0	lung adenocarcinomas	NA	rs885518	INTRO	At 9p21.3 we identified rs885518 that appeared to be associated with lung adenocarcinoma (OR=1.17, 95% CI 1.11-1.23, p=6.8x10-10).
0	cancers	NA	NA	INTRO	9p21.3 is a region containing CDNK2A and variants associated with multiple cancer types, including lung cancer.
0	squamous disease	NA	rs885518	INTRO	Nevertheless, rs885518 is located approximately 200kb centromeric the previously described variants (Supplementary Figure 4) and shows little evidence for LD (all pairwise r2< 0.01) with rs1333040, a variant previously associated with lung squamous cell carcinoma and rs62560775, another variant suggested to be associated with lung adenocarcinoma that we confirm to genome significance here.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Intriguingly, these variants appear to confer predominant associations with different lung cancer histologies suggesting that they are independent associations (Supplementary Figure 7)
1	lung cancer	CHRNA5	NA	INTRO	Aside from the clear smoking-related effects on lung cancer risk through the CHRNA5 and CYP2A6 regions and association with CHRNA2 noted above, the rest of variants we have identified do not appear to clearly influence smoking behaviors (Table 2), implying that these associations are likely mediated by other mechanisms.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Nevertheless, there is shared genetic architecture between smoking behavior and lung cancer risk, consistent with the notion that genetic variants do influence lung cancer risk also through behavioral mechanisms (Supplementary Figure 8)
0	cancers	NA	NA	INTRO	In conclusion, the genetic susceptibility alleles we describe here explain approximately 12.3% of the familial relative risk previously reported in family cancer databases, out of which 3.5% was accounted for by the novel loci.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Our findings emphasize striking heterogeneity across histological subtypes of lung cancer.

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Sentinel genetic variants associated with telomere length were those described by Codd et al.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Telomere lengths in 6,766 individuals from the UK Studies of Epidemiology and Risk Factors in Cancer Heredity (SEARCH) study controls using a real-time PCR methodology and genotyping as described in Pooley et al., 2013
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Genome-wide SNP heritability and correlation estimates were obtained using association summary statistics and linkage disequilibrium (LD) information through LD Score (LDSC) regression analyses.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	These analyses were restricted to HapMap3 SNPs with minor allele frequency above 5% in European populations of 1000 Genomes.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Association summary statistics used for these analyses were based on lung cancer histological/smoking types (lung cancer overall, adenocarcinoma, squamous cell, small cell, ever smokers and never smokers) and smoking behavior parameters (cigarettes per day (CPD), smoking status (ever vs never smokers), and smoking cessation (current vs former smokers) from TRICL-ILCCO OncoArray consortium and Tobacco And Genetics consortium (https://www.med.unc.edu/pgc/downloads)
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The familial relative risk to a first degree relative accounted for by an individual variant (denoted as lambdai) is estimated based on relative risk per allele and allele frequency for that variant, using the method described in Hemminki et al, and Bahcall, under the assumption of log-additive effect.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Assuming the effects of all susceptibility variants combined multiplicatively and not in linkage disequilibrium, the combined effect (lambdaT) can then be expressed as the product of all lambdai.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The proportion of the familial relative risk attributable to the totality of the susceptibility variants can then be computed as log(lambdaT)/log(lambdaP).
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	METHODS	For lung cancer, the lambdaP is approximately 2.0 based on the family cancer databases.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The percentage reported is based on the 18 sentinel variants reported in Table 2.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The multiple independent alleles in the same locus are not accounted for in this estimation
