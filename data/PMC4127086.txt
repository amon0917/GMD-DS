0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Performing genetic studies in multiple human populations can identify disease risk alleles that are common in one population but rare in others, with the potential to illuminate pathophysiology, health disparities, and the population genetic origins of disease alleles.
0	Type 2 diabetes	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	We analyzed 9.2 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in each of 8,214 Mexicans and Latin Americans: 3,848 with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and 4,366 non-diabetic controls.
1	NA	SLC16A11	NA	ABSTRACT	In addition to replicating previous findings, we identified a novel locus associated with T2D at genome-wide significance spanning the solute carriers SLC16A11 and SLC16A13 (P=3.9x10-13; odds ratio (OR)=1.29).
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	The association was stronger in younger, leaner people with T2D, and replicated in independent samples (P=1.1x10-4; OR=1.20).

0	NA	SLC16A11	NA	ABSTRACT	Despite T2D having been well studied by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in other populations, analysis in Mexican and Latin American individuals identified SLC16A11 as a novel candidate gene for T2D with a possible role in triacylglycerol metabolism
0	Type 2 diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	The Slim Initiative in Genomic Medicine for the Americas (SIGMA) Type 2 Diabetes Consortium set out to characterize the genetic basis of T2D in Mexican and Latin American populations, where the prevalence is roughly twice that of U.S. non-Hispanic whites.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	This report considers 3,848 T2D cases and 4,366 controls (Table 1) genotyped using the Illumina OMNI 2.5 array that were unrelated to other samples, and that fall on a cline of Native American and European ancestry (Extended Data Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	1).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Association analysis included 9.2 million variants that were imputed from the 1,000 Genomes Project Phase I release based on 1.38 million SNPs directly genotyped at high quality with minor allele frequency (MAF) >1%
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The association of SNP genotype with T2D was evaluated using LTSOFT, a method that increases power by jointly modeling case-control status with non-genetic risk factors.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Our analysis utilized body mass index (BMI) and age to construct liability scores and also included adjustment for sex and ancestry via principal components.

0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We first examined SNPs previously reported to be associated to risk of T2D.

1	NA	KCNQ1	rs2237897	INTRO	At KCNQ1, we identified a signal of association that shows limited linkage disequilibrium both to rs2237897 (r2=0.056) and to rs231362 (r2=0.028) (previously seen in Europeans), suggesting a third allele at this locus (rs139647931; after conditioning, P=5.3x10-8; OR=0.78 [0.70-0.86]; Extended Data Fig.

0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	This excess signal of association is entirely attributable to two regions of the genome: chromosome 11p15.5 and 17p13.1 (Fig.

1	NA	KCNQ1	NA	INTRO	The associated SNPs are ~700 kb from the genome-wide significant signal in KCNQ1 (above), and analysis conditional on the two significant KCNQ1 SNPs reduced the INS-IGF2 association signal to just below genome-wide significance (P=7.5x10-7, Extended Data Fig.

0	NA	SLC16A11	NA	INTRO	The strongest signal of association includes a silent mutation as well as four missense SNPs, all in SLC16A11 (Fig.

0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	This combination of age and geographic distribution could be consistent with admixture from Neandertals into modern humans.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Neither the published Neandertal genome nor the Denisova genome contained the variants observed on the 5 SNP haplotype.
0	NA	SLC16A11	NA	INTRO	However, an unpublished genome of a Neandertal from Denisova Cave is homozygous across 5 kb for the 5 SNP haplotype at SLC16A11, including all four missense SNPs.

0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Two lines of evidence suggest that the 5 SNP haplotype entered modern humans through archaic admixture.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	First, the Neandertal sequence is more closely related to the 5 SNP haplotype than to random non-risk haplotypes (mean TMRCA=250k years versus 677k years; Supplementary Tables 10 and 11, Supplementary Note), forming a clade (Extended Data Fig.

0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Second, the genetic length of the 73 kb haplotype is longer than would be expected if it had undergone recombination for ~9,000 generations since the split with Neandertals (P=3.9x10-5; Supplementary Note).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	These two features indicate that the 5 SNP haplotype is not only similar to the Neandertal sequence, but was likely introduced into modern humans relatively recently through archaic admixture.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We note that while this particular Neandertal-derived haplotype is common in the Americas, Latin Americans have the same proportion of Neandertal ancestry genome-wide as other Eurasian populations (~2%)
0	NA	SLC16A11	NA	INTRO	With an absence of multiple independently segregating functional mutations in the same gene, we lack formal genetic proof that SLC16A11 is the gene responsible for association to T2D at 17p13.1.
