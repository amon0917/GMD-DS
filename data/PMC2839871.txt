1	pancreatic cancer	ABO blood group	rs505922	INTRO	In a combined analysis of individuals of European background the strongest association with pancreatic cancer below the threshold for genome-wide significance was observed for a locus on chromosome 9q34, located within the first intron of ABO, a well-described blood group gene, marked by rs505922 (P=5.37 x 10-8; trend model; heterozygous odds ratio [ORHet] of 1.20; 95% CI 1.12-1.28 and homozygous odds ratio [ORHom] of 1.44; 95% CI 1.26-1.63).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	A comparable result was observed when all ethnic groups were included in the first stage (P=2.61 x 10-8; Supplemental Table 3).
1	NA	NA	rs687621	INTRO	In the case-control replication set, we genotyped a second SNP, rs687621 (r2=1 with rs505922 in HapMap CEU and r2=0.91 in Stage 2 control individuals), located 12 kb centromeric in intron 2; the results provided confirmation of the locus (P=1.57x10-4 in the second-stage case-control studies only).
1	NA	NA	rs630014	INTRO	In the combined analysis, a comparably strong signal was observed for rs630014 (P=1.58x10-7; ORHet 0.85, ORHom 0.71), which resides within 500 bp of rs505922 and is in linkage disequilibrium (r2=0.52 in HapMap CEU and 0.40 in PanScan GWAS European control individuals).
1	NA	ABO blood group	rs505922	INTRO	After adjusting for rs505922, none of the remaining SNPs in ABO were significant at the P<0.01 level.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The SNPs reside in a haplotype block that encompasses the proximal promoter and introns 1 and 2 (Figure 2)
1	NA	ABO blood group	NA	INTRO	Blood groups were first described by Karl Landsteiner in 1900 but the structure of the ABO antigens and their biosynthesis remained elusive until after 1950.
1	NA	ABO blood group	NA	INTRO	The ABO gene encodes a glycosyltransferase that catalyzes the transfer of carbohydrates to the H antigen, forming the antigenic structure of the ABO blood groups.
1	NA	ABO blood group	NA	INTRO	The proteins encoded by the A and B alleles of the ABO gene differ minimally in amino acid sequence but catalyze the transfer of different carbohydrates (N-acetylgalactosamine or galactose) onto the H antigen to form the A or B antigens.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Individuals with the O blood group do not produce either the A or B antigens due to a single base deletion
1	gastrointestinal cancers	ABO blood group	NA	INTRO	Our findings are notable because multiple studies, mainly from the 1950s and 1960s reported an association between ABO blood type and gastrointestinal cancers, strongest for gastric cancer but also for pancreatic cancer.
1	gastric	ABO blood group	rs505922	INTRO	The protective allele (T) for rs505922 is in complete linkage disequilibrium (LD) (r2=1.0) with the O allele of the ABO locus, consistent with earlier reports showing increased risk of gastric and pancreatic cancer for individuals of the A and B blood groups.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	It is plausible that the single base deletion that generates the O blood group underlies the association signal but further mapping and laboratory work is required to determine which variant(s) account for the observed association
1	NA	ABO blood group	NA	INTRO	Genetic variation in the first intron of the ABO gene has also been associated with circulating levels of serum tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) levels circulating soluble intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (sICAM-1) and plasma levels of alkaline phosphatase.
1	pancreatic cancer	TNFalpha	rs505922	INTRO	Although higher TNF-alpha levels are associated with the common allele of rs505922, protective for pancreatic cancer in our study, the data concerning the relationship between blood groups and TNF-alpha levels are inconsistent.
1	NA	ICAM-1	rs507666	INTRO	Furthermore, this region could be important for regulating circulating sICAM-1 levels as rs507666 and rs505922 (located 170 bps apart) were recently reported to be associated with circulating ICAM-1 levels.
1	NA	ABO blood group	rs657152	INTRO	Also, SNPs in the ABO locus, including rs657152, have been associated with plasma levels of liver derived alkaline phosphatase.
1	pancreatic cancer	ABO blood group	NA	INTRO	Lastly, altered ABO antigen expression has been observed in primary and metastatic pancreatic cancer as compared to normal pancreatic tissues
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	For rapidly fatal conditions, case-control studies are prone to distortion because they disproportionately include survivors.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	For variants unrelated to survival, case-control data are suitable for discovery and replication of risk-related markers.
0	pancreatic cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	However, for variants related to survival, case-control studies yield biased estimates of the association with pancreatic cancer risk.
1	NA	ABO blood group	NA	INTRO	ABO variants appear unrelated to survival and show strong and similar signals in both cohort and case-control data
0	NA	Sonic Hedgehog	NA	INTRO	We observed an association at the genome-wide level (P=1.76 x 10-7) with SHH among cohorts that was not replicated in follow-up in case-control studies (P=0.12), raising three possibilities: the cohort finding is due to chance, SHH is related to both survival and to risk or that the SNPs failed to replicate because of chance (Table 1).
0	prostate carcinogenesis	Sonic Hedgehog	NA	INTRO	Because there is substantial evidence that SHH plays a role in pancreatic carcinogenesis, further work is required to investigate this region
0	pancreatic cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Pancreatic cancer is among the deadliest cancers with mortality rates approaching incidence rates.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Given there are few known risk factors, improved diagnostics and a finer understanding of the molecular pathogenesis are urgently needed.
1	prostate carcinogenesis	ABO blood group	NA	INTRO	Our findings have identified the contribution of genetic variation in the ABO locus of 9q34 to pancreatic carcinogenesis, a finding that supports an epidemiologic observation first made half a century ago and recently confirmed.
0	pancreatic cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	We are currently conducting a GWAS in the eight studies of stage 2 in this study and anticipate that this will bring the identification of additional loci associated to pancreatic cancer.
