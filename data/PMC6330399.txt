0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly and the sixth leading cause of death in the United States.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	AD is mainly considered a complex disorder with polygenic inheritance.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Despite discovering many susceptibility loci, a major proportion of AD genetic variance remains to be explained
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	We investigated the genetic architecture of AD in four publicly available independent datasets through genome-wide association, transcriptome-wide association, and gene-based and pathway-based analyses.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	To explore differences in the genetic basis of AD between males and females, analyses were performed on three samples in each dataset: males and females combined, only males, or only females
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Our genome-wide association analyses corroborated the associations of several previously detected AD loci and revealed novel significant associations of 35 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) outside the chromosome 19q13 region at the suggestive significance level of p < 5E-06.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	These SNPs were mapped to 21 genes in 19 chromosomal regions.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Of these, 17 genes were not associated with AD at genome-wide or suggestive levels of associations by previous genome-wide association studies.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Also, the chromosomal regions corresponding to 8 genes did not contain any previously detected AD-associated SNPs with p < 5E-06.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Our transcriptome-wide association and gene-based analyses revealed that 26 genes located in 20 chromosomal regions outside chromosome 19q13 had evidence of potential associations with AD at a false discovery rate of 0.05.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Of these, 13 genes/regions did not contain any previously AD-associated SNPs at genome-wide or suggestive levels of associations.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Most of the newly detected AD-associated SNPs and genes were sex specific, indicating sex disparities in the genetic basis of AD.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Also, 7 of 26 pathways that showed evidence of associations with AD in our pathway-bases analyses were significant only in females
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Our findings, particularly the newly discovered sex-specific genetic contributors, provide novel insight into the genetic architecture of AD and can advance our understanding of its pathogenesis

0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a slowly progressive neurodegenerative disorder that usually manifests with insidious deterioration of cognitive functions such as memory, language, judgment, and reasoning.
0	aggressive disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Visuospatial deficits and neuropsychiatric symptoms like anxiety, irritability, depression, delusion, and personality changes may occur in the course of the disease, and these are eventually followed by impairment of most daily activities.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The median survival is 3.3-11.7 years after disease manifestation.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Except for some uncommon autosomal dominant forms, AD is mainly a complex disorder with a polygenic nature that predominantly affects elderly individuals, also known as late-onset AD.
0	dementia	NA	NA	INTRO	It is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly worldwide and is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Age is the main risk factor for AD.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The annual incidence increases from 1% at age 65 years to 6-8% after 85 years, and its prevalence increases from 11% to 32%.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	In addition, AD is more prevalent in females than males, with their lifetime risk of developing the disease being almost twice that of males.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	This might be to some extent justified by different life expectancies of males and females.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	However, Genin et al.
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	INTRO	suggested that the age-adjusted penetrance of Apolipoprotein E (APOE) was sex dependent as well.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	For instance, they found that the lifetime risks for homozygote APOE-epsilon4 carriers were 51% and 60% in males and females older than 85 years, respectively.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The corresponding risks for heterozygote APOE-epsilon3epsilon4 carriers were 23% and 30%, respectively.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	AD is also more severe in females than males.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Henderson and Buckwalter reported that female AD patients had greater impairment of naming task, verbal fluency, and delayed recall compared to male patients.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In another study, Barnes et al.
0	Alzheimer's disease	beta-amyloid (Abeta)	NA	INTRO	suggested that females were more likely to develop clinical AD compared to males in response to pathology changes (e.g., amyloid beta (Abeta) and neurofibrillary tangles) in the brain.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	They found that each additional unit of pathology in the brain would increase the odds of overt AD by 20-fold and 3-fold in females and males, respectively.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	The underlying mechanisms of sex disparity in AD are not fully clear.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	This may raise the possibility that such sex disparities might be in part due to potential differences in the genetic bases of AD between males and females.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Investigating such differences is important, particularly for tailoring more effective medical interventions
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Give the considerable physical, emotional, and economic burdens imposed by AD on patients, their families, and societies, exploring the genetic and nongenetic mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis has become a public health priority.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	With increased life expectancy, the prevalence and global economic costs of AD are forecast to increase considerably by 2050.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Many studies have investigated the genetic basis of AD.
0	Alzheimer's disease	apolipoprotein E	NA	INTRO	APOE was the first gene linked to late-onset AD, and, in particular, the dosage of its epsilon4 allele was implicated in increasing the risks of disease and earlier onset.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	More susceptibility loci were detected with the advent of genome-wide association (GWA) methodology, although not all of them were consistently replicated in independent datasets.
0	Alzheimer's disease	apolipoprotein E	NA	INTRO	In addition to APOE, which was almost universally replicated, BIN1, CLU, CR1, CD2AP, CD33, MS4A4E, MS4A6A, EPHA1, and PICALM genes have been associated with the polygenic form of AD in different studies.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	The narrow-sense heritability (h2) of AD (i.e., the proportion of its phenotypic variance explained by additive genetic variance) has been estimated to be 58-79% by twin studies.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Furthermore, Ridge et al., using a linear mixed models (LMMs) framework, found that 53% of phenotypic variance of AD can be explained by ~ 8 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	They also noticed that SNPs inside known AD-associated genes or within their 50 kb upstream/downstream regions can only explain ~ 31% of AD phenotypic variance (~ 59% of genetic variance), leaving a sizable portion of its h2 to be explained
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	In this study, we investigated the genetic architecture of polygenic AD through genome-wide association (GWA), transcriptome-wide association (TWA), gene-based, and pathway-based analyses in four independent datasets (two with family designs and two with population designs) using genetic information for approximately 2 million genotyped and imputed SNPs.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Since exploring the genetic sex disparity of AD was of particular interest, in addition to analyzing the entire sample of males and females in each dataset, two alternative plans were also considered in which either only males or only females were included in analyses
0	Alzheimer's disease	HRS	NA	METHODS	Four independent datasets were used to fulfill the aims of this study: Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease Family Study from the National Institute on Aging (NIA-LOADFS); Framingham SNP Health Association Resource (SHARe) project from Framingham Heart Study (FHS); SNP Typing for Association with Multiple Phenotypes from Existing Epidemiologic Data (STAMPEED) project from Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS); and University of Michigan Health and Retirement Study (HRS).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	All four datasets were approved by the institutional review boards (IRBs) and had gathered data after obtaining written informed consent from participants or their legal guardians/proxies.
0	CHS	HRS	NA	METHODS	Details about the designs of the NIA-LOADFS, FHS, CHS, and HRS studies can be found in the original publications.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	METHODS	Briefly, the NIA-LOADFS is a family-based study primarily initiated to investigate late-onset AD risk factors.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	METHODS	It recruited families with multiple affected members if the age at AD onset or diagnosis of proband was above 60 years.
0	aggressive disease	NA	NA	METHODS	Controls were selected from unaffected individuals with a minimum age of 50 years who had no history of major neurological/psychiatric disorders or life-threatening conditions.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	METHODS	Of 9468 participants with phenotype data, 5220 subjects (2319 affected with AD), predominantly Caucasians, were genotyped using Illumina's Human 610-Quad array.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The FHS is an ongoing longitudinal study with a family-based design that provides phenotype and genotype information on individuals from three-generational families with Caucasian ancestry.
0	cardiovascular disease	NA	NA	METHODS	The main objective of the study was to investigate cardiovascular disorder risk factors.
0	cardiac dysfunctions	NA	NA	METHODS	It was first initiated by recruiting 5209 participants (i.e., original cohort) between ages 30 and 62 years with no history of cardiac disease or stroke.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Later, the cohort was expanded by adding the offspring of the original cohort and their spouses (5124 subjects as the offspring cohort) and their grandchildren (4095 subjects as the third generation).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Of these, 9274 individuals (1529, 3852, and 3893 individuals from the three aforementioned generations, respectively) were genotyped using the Affymetrix Human Mapping 500 K array in the SHARe project.
0	CHS	NA	NA	METHODS	The CHS is a population-based longitudinal study with the main objective of investigating risk factors contributing to heart diseases.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	It was initiated by recruiting an original cohort of 5221 mainly Caucasian participants who were older than 65 years and had not been institutionalized.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Later, a new cohort of 687 participants, predominantly African-Americans, was added to the study.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Of these, 3989 and 803 individuals were genotyped by Illumina's Human CNV370-Duo and Human Omni1-Quad arrays, respectively, in the STAMPEED project.
0	NA	HRS	NA	METHODS	The HRS is a population-based longitudinal study launched to provide age-related health and economic information on more than 20,000 individuals older than 50 years.
0	NA	HRS	NA	METHODS	The HRS makes use of administrative records such as Social Security and Medicare claims to gather information of interest about participants.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The study was expanded in 2006 to include a biomarker and genetic component in which 12,595 individuals, predominantly Caucasian, were genotyped by Illumina's Human Omni2.5-Quad array
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Our study focused on people of Caucasian ancestry from the four aforementioned studies to increase the sample size and power of the analyses.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	METHODS	The LOADFS and FHS datasets directly identify cases with Alzheimer's disease and unaffected controls.
0	CHS	HRS	NA	METHODS	For the CHS and HRS datasets, the International Classification of Disease codes, ninth revision (ICD-9) were used to define cases and controls.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Finally, to make the four datasets comparable in terms of participants age, we only included the original and offspring cohorts from the FHS dataset.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Demographic information about the cohorts included in our study is presented in Table 1.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Also, Additional file 1: Table S1 lists the numbers of cases and controls in these cohorts
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Since the four datasets of interest were genotyped using different platforms, imputation was conducted to generate a common set of 2,928,658 SNPs.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Only autosomal SNPs were subject to imputation.
0	NA	LGR5	NA	METHODS	Genome coordinates of SNPs in our data (NCBI build 38/UCSC hg38) were lifted over to NCBI build 37/UCSC hg19 using LiftOver software.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	After removing duplicate SNPs, preimputation quality control (QC) was performed using PLINK software to remove low-quality SNPs/subjects by setting the following QC criteria: minor allele frequency < 0.01, SNPs and subject call rates < 95%, and Hardy-Weinberg p < 1E-06.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	For the LOADFS and FHS cohorts that have family-based designs, a Mendel error rate of 2% was set to remove SNPs and subjects/families with high Mendelian errors.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The SHAPEIT2 (i.e., Segmented Haplotype Estimation and Imputation Tool) package was used to ensure that alleles were aligned to the same DNA strand in our and the reference data.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Haplotype phasing was then conducted using SHAPEIT2 to estimate the haplotypes for subjects in each dataset.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Finally, genotypes were imputed by Minimac3 software over prephased haplotypes.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	SHAPEIT2 and Minimac3 were run using default values for input arguments and European population (EUR) haplotypes from 1000 Genomes Phase 3 data (release October 2014) as the reference panel
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Directly genotyped SNPs along with the imputed SNPs, for which the squared correlation (r2) between imputed and expected true genotypes was > 0.7, were selected for preanalysis QC.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	This step was performed based on the same criteria explained earlier for preimputation QC.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Additional file 1: Table S2 contains information on the numbers of genotyped and imputed SNPs that remained in each of the four datasets of interest after QC
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The top 20 principal components (PCs) of genotype data were obtained through principal component analysis (PCA) to be included in downstream genetic analyses to address potential population stratification.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	In each dataset, PCA was performed over a subset of unrelated individuals and a subset of SNPs that were not in high linkage disequilibrium (LD) measured by r2.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	KING (i.e., Kinship-based Inference for Genome-wide association studies) software was used to obtain the subset of unrelated subjects by keeping one subject per family or relative cluster whose identity-by-descent (IBD) was > 0.0884 (i.e., closer than third-degree relatives).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The genotyped autosomal SNPs on each chromosome were then pruned by PLINK software in an unrelated set of subjects such that no SNP pairs with r2 > 0.2 were kept within any 100-SNP windows.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	PCA was then conducted over the selected low-LD SNPs with the GENESIS R package.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Additional file 1: Table S3 contains genomic inflation factors (lambda values) resulting from logistic regression models for the four datasets under consideration.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The lambda values were less than 1.1 in all cases, indicating a subtle impact of population structure on our analyses
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	METHODS	The associations between SNPs and AD were investigated by fitting logistic regression models.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The genetic analyses of each dataset were performed under three alternative plans analyzing the entire sample, only males, and only females.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The top five PCs and subject's birth cohort (i.e., birth year) were included in the models as fixed-effects covariates.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	In addition, sex was considered a fixed-effect covariate under plan 1.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Only additive genetic effects were modeled; dominance effects were ignored.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The birth cohort is a proxy for the age and environmental exposures which are characteristic for a cohort.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	METHODS	Thus, this adjustment controls for age and overtime trends in the incidence of AD.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The logistic models were fitted using PLINK software (v1.07).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	It was previously suggested that for samples with a family-based design, ignoring family relationships would not generate considerable bias in effect sizes of SNPs but may increase type I error rates whose magnitude depends on pedigree complexity (e.g., nuclear family vs extended family) and trait heritability.
0	inflation of type I error	NA	NA	METHODS	For instance, the inflation of type I error rates has been suggested to be trivial in datasets with simple pedigrees.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	On the other hand, type I error rates may increase by a factor of 2-3 when family structure is ignored in a dataset with an extended family pedigree and trait heritability values of 0.6-0.9.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Therefore, a two-step screening-validating approach could be used with such datasets to prevent inflation of type I error rates and decrease the computational burden of analysis.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	For the LOADFS and FHS cohorts, we adopted a two-step approach in which the SNPs with p < 0.05 in the logistic models explained earlier were subjected to fitting generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) by including all aforementioned fixed-effects covariates along with family IDs as a random-effects covariate.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	GLMMs were fitted using the lme4 R package
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	All GWA analyses were conducted in a discovery-replication manner.
0	CHS	HRS	NA	METHODS	Each of the LOADFS, FHS, CHS, and HRS datasets was considered a discovery set to detect SNPs in significant associations with AD.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Results from the discovery stage in a particular dataset were then subject to further replication in the remaining three datasets.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	At the discovery stage, a genome-wide significance level of p < 5E-08 was set to select statistically significant associations, and SNPs with p values between 5E-08 and 5E-06 were considered suggestive AD-associated markers.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	These significance levels are widely accepted by genome-wide association studies in order to decrease the type I error rate (i.e., false-positive findings) due to multiple testing issues arising from investigating associations of millions of SNPs.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	A Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold of 0.0167 (i.e., 0.05/3, where 3 is the number of replication datasets for validating any significant association signals from a discovery dataset) was considered at the replication stage
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Finally, a conventional fixed-effects meta-analysis, using the inverse variance method, was conducted over the results under each plan from the four investigated datasets to obtain combined statistics for the tested SNPs.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	To avoid missing heterogeneous associations of opposite directions of effects, we also performed a meta-analysis on absolute values of coefficients in addition to the conventional meta-test.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The results from the meta-analysis on absolute values of coefficients were used just as an additional piece of information to determine how heterogeneous effects in different cohorts can affect the results of a conventional inverse-variance meta-analysis.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The meta-analysis results were interpreted according to the significance level at the discovery phase.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The meta-analysis was performed using GWAMA (i.e., Genome-Wide Association Meta-Analysis) software
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Also, for SNPs that had significant p values only in males or females (i.e., plans 2 or 3), a Wald chi2 statistic with 1 degree of freedom was calculated according to the following formula to investigate whether their odds ratios were significantly different between the two sexes
0	NA	sef	NA	METHODS	where bm and bf are the coefficients (i.e., the natural logarithm of odds ratios) for any SNP in males and females, respectively, and sem and sef are their corresponding standard errors
0	NA	GRASP	NA	METHODS	The significant findings from GWA analyses were compared to previous studies using the GRASP (i.e., Genome-Wide Repository of Associations Between SNPs and Phenotypes) search tool (v2.0.0.0).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Also, LD between significant SNPs and previously detected AD-associated loci in their 1-Mb flanking regions (r2 >= 0.4 or significant p value from chi2 test for LD) was investigated in the CEU population (i.e., Utah Residents with Northern and Western European Ancestry) through the HaploR R package and the LDlink web-tool.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The genes coordinate's list provided by PLINK was used to find the closest genes of the significant SNPs.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The chromosomal regions (i.e., cytogenetic bands) were determined using the annotation database from UCSC Genome Browser
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Under each of three aforementioned plans, gene-based analysis was performed over the meta-analysis results using the fastBAT (i.e., Fast set-Based Association Test) method implemented in the GCTA (i.e., Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis) package (v1.26.0).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	This method combines z-statistics for a set of SNPs corresponding to each gene into a quadratic form of a multivariate normal variable.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	SNPs located within a gene or its 50 kb upstream/downstream regions were considered as an SNP set for that gene.
0	NA	HRS	NA	METHODS	The HRS dataset was used as the reference panel for LD calculation (i.e., r2 metric) in order to remove one of each pair of SNPs with r2 > 0.9 from any given set.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	To deal with multiple-testing issues, the false discovery rate (FDR) method suggested by Benjamini and Hochberg was used to rank and select significant findings.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Genes with significant p values at the FDR level of 0.05 were considered novel AD-associated ones if there were no SNPs with p < 5E-08 in their 1-Mb upstream/downstream regions in the current or previous studies
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	A pathway-based analysis was also performed using the fastBAT method using the pathways predefined by the REACTOME pathway knowledgebase and PID (i.e., the Pathway Interaction Database).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	These were provided by the molecular signatures database (MSigDB) at the Broad Institute gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) website.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Here, a SNP set corresponding to a particular pathway was defined as the SNPs within 50 kb of the genes in that pathway.
0	NA	HRS	NA	METHODS	As with the gene-based analysis, the HRS cohort was used to prune the SNP sets based on the pairwise LD measures of SNPs.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The significant results were interpreted at the FDR levels of 0.05 (plans 1 and 2) and 0.025 (plan 3) to ensure that the number of possible false-positives was < 1 under each analysis plan
0	NA	SMR	NA	METHODS	Results from conducted meta-analyses along with summary data from a publicly available expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) study on peripheral blood were used to perform a transcriptome-wide association analysis using SMR (i.e., Summary-data-based Mendelian Randomization) software (v0.68).
0	NA	SMR	NA	METHODS	The eQTLs summary data were downloaded from the SMR software website.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Both cis-eQTLs and trans-eQTLs were of interest.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Trans-eQTLs were defined as eQTLs located at least 5 Mb away from a probe on the same chromosome or located on other chromosomes.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Probes for which at least one eQTL with p < 5E-08 had been detected by Lloyd-Jones et al.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	were included in our analyses provided that the corresponding eQTLs were among the genotyped or imputed SNPs in our study.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	This resulted in the inclusion of sets of up to 8257 probes with cis-eQTLs and 2763 probes with trans-eQTLs
0	NA	SMR	NA	METHODS	The significance of p values resulting from SMR testing (i.e., PSMR) was interpreted at an FDR level of 0.025-0.05.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The appropriate FDR level for each of three analysis plans was chosen so we can ensure that the number of possible false-positive findings among significant probes was < 1.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	METHODS	To identify the pleiotropic effects of SNPs on gene expression levels and AD development, probes with significant PSMR values were then subject to heterogeneity testing (i.e., the HEIDI test) which can differentiate pleiotropy from linkage.
0	Alzheimer's disease	SMR	NA	METHODS	Genes corresponding to probes that passed both the SMR and HEIDI tests (i.e., significant PSMR and PHEIDI >= 0.05) were deemed significant as their expression profiles might be associated with AD because of the pleiotropic effect of a single variant that affects both probe expression and AD susceptibility.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	METHODS	Selected genes were considered potentially novel AD genes if there were no SNPs with p < 5E-08 within their 1-Mb upstream/downstream regions in the current or previous studies
0	hypothalamus	NA	NA	METHODS	Finally, we also performed TWA analyses using summary results from a publically available tissue-specific eQTLs study which contains eQTLs data for several regions of the brain, including the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex (BA24), basal ganglia (e.g., caudate, nucleus accumbens, and putamen), cerebellar hemisphere, cerebellum, cortex, frontal cortex (BA9), hippocampus, hypothalamus, and substantia nigra.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Once again, probes that had significant eQTLs with p < 5E-08 were included in our analyses.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	This resulted in the inclusion of sets of 597-3566 probes with cis-eQTLs (based on the brain region).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The results of brain-specific TWA analyses were interpreted at a FDR level of 0.05

0	CHS	HRS	NA	RESULTS	GWA analyses were performed in four independent datasets (i.e., LOADFS, FHS, CHS, and HRS).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Each of these datasets served as a discovery set to detect SNPs with significant association signals (at either a genome-wide significance level of p < 5E-08 or a suggestive level between 5E-08 and 5E-06), which were then subject to further replication (at the significance level of 0.0167) in the other three datasets.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	These analyses provided replicated and nonreplicated sets of SNPs.

0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	rs9882471	RESULTS	Among previously detected SNPs, rs9882471 (plan 2) was nominally associated with AD in previous studies (5E-06 <= p < 5E-02)
0	Alzheimer's disease	apolipoprotein E	NA	RESULTS	Most of the newly detected SNPs were located inside a previously well-known susceptibility region for AD on chromosome 19q13 (i.e., APOE cluster gene region) and were mostly significant under different analysis plans.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	This subset of newly detected SNPs mostly had p < 5E-08, the same directions of effects in discovery and replication datasets, and significant p values (at genome-wide or suggestive levels of significance) in the meta-analysis

0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Table 2 summarizes information about the four newly detected SNPs located outside the chromosome 19q13 region.
0	NA	NA	rs62402815	RESULTS	Among these SNPs, rs62402815 was significant under plan 1 (i.e., males and females) and plan 3 (i.e., only females); and rs9918162 and rs726411 were significant only in males (i.e., plan 2).
0	NA	NA	rs62402815	RESULTS	Their association signals were significant only at the suggestive level of associations (except rs62402815, which had a genome-wide level significant p = 1.2E-08 in females) in the discovery stage.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The two SNPs that were significant in males did not have p < 5E-06 in conventional fixed-effects meta-analyses, which might be partially due to the heterogeneity of their effects across different datasets.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	These heterogeneous effects were reflected by high i2 inconsistency metrics and significant Q-statistics in Cochran's heterogeneity test (Pq < 0.05).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	A meta-analysis based on the absolute values of the coefficients confirmed a substantial role of heterogeneity by providing smaller p values for most of these SNPs
0	NA	NA	rs62402815	RESULTS	Also, rs62402815 and rs726411 had the same direction of effects in the discovery and replication datasets.
0	NA	NA	rs9918162	RESULTS	The directions of effects of rs9918162 were opposite in the discovery and replication sets.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	While genetic variants that have the same direction of effects in multiple independent cohorts are generally of more interest, those with opposite effects can be important as well because they may be indicative of the genetic heterogeneity of the studied trait in different cohorts arising, for example, from the epistasis or differences in LD patterns
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	Although no evidence of direct association with AD was found in previous studies for the newly detected subsets of replicated SNPs, their 1-Mb upstream/downstream regions harbor AD-associated SNPs.

0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	Newly detected SNPs were considered informative AD markers if their p values were smaller than those of the top AD-associated SNPs in their neighborhood or they were not in LD with previously AD-associated loci whose p values were smaller than those detected in this study.

0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	As seen in Additional file 1: Table S13, all newly detected SNPs on chromosome 19q13 had larger p values than the top AD-associated loci in their neighborhood and were in LD with them.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Therefore, they were likely to relay the same information as their neighboring AD-associated SNPs
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	On the other hand, the p values of SNPs located outside the chromosome 19q13 region were mostly smaller than the previously detected association signals in their flanking regions and were not in LD with such loci.
0	Alzheimer's disease	ADCY8	rs726411	RESULTS	As seen in Table 2, among the closest genes to these SNPs, only ADCY8 (corresponding to rs726411 located in the 8q24.22 region) was associated with AD in previous GWAS at a suggestive level of associations (rs263238 with p = 2.40E-06).

0	NA	NA	rs34779859	RESULTS	Once again, SNPs located outside the chromosome 19q13 region either had smaller p values than previously detected AD-associated loci in their proximity or were not in LD with them, except for rs34779859 on chromosome 2 (plan 3) which was significant in females.

0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Additional file 1: Tables S10-S12 show that 17, 4, and 24 SNPs that were not among replicated or nonreplicated sets of significant SNPs under analysis plans 1-3 passed the significance threshold in the meta-analysis.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Additional files 2, 3, and 4 summarize the GWA results for these SNPs.
0	NA	NA	rs76366838	RESULTS	The meta-analysis p values of these SNPs were mostly significant at the level of suggestive associations, except for rs76366838, rs115881343 (plan 1), rs73048293, rs57537848, and rs76366838 (plan 3) on chromosome 19q13 which had p < 5E-08.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Also, they were mostly located outside chromosome 19q13 and were plan specific (i.e., they were not among replicated, nonreplicated, or meta-analysis sets of significant SNPs under other plans).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	For example, significant SNPs in males were not significant in females and vice versa.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	In addition, most SNPs (14, 3, and 24 SNPS under plans 1-3, respectively) were not associated with AD in previous studies.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Summary information about the newly detected subset of meta-analysis sets of SNPs that were outside chromosome 19q13 is presented in Table 2.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	As with the replicated and nonreplicated sets of SNPs, most of the newly detected SNPs not on chromosome 19q13 had smaller p values than the ones reported for their nearby AD-associated loci or were not in LD with them.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	These SNPs, therefore, were considered novel and informative AD markers.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	On the other hand, proxy AD-associated SNPs were found for all newly detected SNPs that were located on chromosome 19q13 (Additional file 1: Table S13)
1	Alzheimer's disease	AP2A2	rs10794342	RESULTS	As seen in Table 2, among the closest genes to newly detected SNPs outside the chromosome 19q13 region, AP2A2 (corresponding to rs10794342), MYO16 (corresponding to rs9555561 and rs912322 in the 13q33.3 region) and STK32B (corresponding to rs17675640, rs6838792, and rs895681 in the 4p16.2 region) were previously associated with AD with p < 5E-06 (rs17393344 with p = 1.70E-08; and rs78647349 with p = 5.20E-07, respectively).
1	Alzheimer's disease	KBTBD8	NA	RESULTS	In addition, several chromosomal regions including 3p14.1 (KBTBD8), 6p21.33 (TNXB), 7q22.1 (TRIM56), 12q24.33 (SFSWAP), 18q12.1 (MIR302F), 21q21.3 (MIR155HG, LINC00515, and MRPL39), and 23q21.31 (KLHL4) were associated with AD at a suggestive level of associations by previous GWAS.
1	NA	C9orf92	NA	RESULTS	However, no AD-associated SNPs with p < 5E-06 have been previously detected in chromosomal regions corresponding to C9orf92, PAX5, LHX1, and LINC00158 genes (i.e., 9p22.3, 9p13.2, 17q12, and 21q21.2, respectively) that were significant under plan 1; and ANTXR1 and SYK genes (i.e., 2p13.3 and 9q22.2, respectively).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Detailed information about these AD-associated genes and chromosomal regions is provided in Additional files 2, 3, and 4
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	Under each of the three analysis plans, there were several SNPs associated with AD at a nominal level of significance (5E-06 <= p < 5E-02) in all datasets they were present in.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	They were mostly present in three datasets as they were excluded from one dataset by the QC procedure.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	These SNPs (30, 28, and 28 SNPs under plans 1-3, respectively) are listed in Additional files 2, 3, and 4.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Although they did not have highly significant p values, they are reported here due to the consistency in their association signals that was observed in multiple tested datasets.
0	NA	NA	rs575088	RESULTS	With the exception of rs575088, which had nominally significant p values in all datasets under plans 1 and 3, the significance pattern of the other SNPs was observed under only one plan.
1	NA	NA	rs2282079	RESULTS	Also, rs2282079 (detected in females) was among the meta-analysis set of SNPs under plan 1 as well.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	None of these SNPs had p < 5E-06 in the conducted meta-analyses.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The lack of meta-analysis power could be due to the small sample size, weak association signals, absence of some SNPs in one dataset, or heterogeneous effects of some SNPs across the different datasets as evidenced by their high i2 values, significant Q tests, and smaller p values in meta-analysis on absolute values of coefficients.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The SNPs whose associated signals were reported here for the first time were not in LD with previously detected AD-associated loci (p < 5E-06) in their 1-Mb flanking regions (Additional file 1: Table S13).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Interestingly, 22 out of 28 SNPs detected in males had the opposite pattern of significance in females (i.e., p > 0.05 in all datasets).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Also, 26 out of 28 SNPs detected in females had the opposite pattern of significance in males (Additional file 5).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Not all SNPs with opposite patterns of significance in females-only vs males-only analyses had the same pattern in the meta-analysis.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	Closest genes to some of these SNPs were located in chromosomal regions that were previously associated with AD with p < 5E-06.

0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	RESULTS	For the AD-associated SNPs that were located on chromosome 19, we further investigated whether their association signals may change after adjustment for APOE genotypes in the models.
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	rs429358	RESULTS	For each subject, the APOE genotype was determined based on its genotypes at rs429358 and rs7412 loci using the coding schema provided in Additional file 1: Table S14.
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	RESULTS	We found that none of the tested SNPs had p < 5E-06 once APOE was added as a covariate to the models
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	RESULTS	Additional file 1: Table S15 summarizes the information regarding the LD between SNPs detected in our study and APOE SNPs.
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	RESULTS	Among newly AD-associated SNPs, only six SNPs were in LD with one or both of the APOE SNPs.
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	RESULTS	Others were not in LD with the two APOE SNPs (i.e., r2 = 0.001-0.072).
0	Alzheimer's disease	apolipoprotein E	rs429358	RESULTS	Therefore, it should be noted that despite a major impact of the APOE genotypes on the associations of other SNPs inside the chromosome 19q13 region with AD, this result would not automatically imply that the APOE SNPs (i.e., rs429358 and rs7412) are the only contributors to AD pathogenesis because APOE-adjusted models highlighted the statistical correlations rather than biological (i.e., genetic) linkage.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Further analyses such as those examining the role of haplotypes and epistatic interactions would be helpful to more comprehensively dissect the genetic heterogeneity of this region, and to elucidate the biological relevance of the APOE-adjusted models
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	We also investigated the sex-specific effects of SNPs that were significantly associated with AD only in males or females by performing a Wald chi2 test to determine whether their odds ratios were significantly different between males and females.

0	NA	NA	rs62405605	RESULTS	We found that the differences between odds ratios of the SNPs in males and females were significant (p < 0.05) in most cases, except rs62405605, rs1062851, rs62510850, rs7000333, rs6572843 (among nonreplicated set of SNPs in females), and rs12386284 (among meta-analysis set of SNPs in females).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Detailed information about the results from the Wald chi2 test can be found in Additional file 6
0	sex-linked autosomal SNPs	GRASP	NA	RESULTS	In addition, the SNPs that had significant p values only in males or females were searched against the GRASP catalog to find out whether they were among the known sex-linked autosomal SNPs or were associated with any other diseases/traits at suggestive level of associations.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We noticed that there was no evidence of such associations in previous studies
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The significant findings from gene-based analyses corresponding to plans 1-3 are summarized in Table 3.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Under all plans, most genes with significant p values at the FDR of 0.05 were located in the chromosome 19q13 region.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	Since the chromosome 19q13 region harbors several SNPs with p < 5E-08 in both current and previous studies, significant genes in this region are not discussed here as they do not meet the criteria set for detecting novel AD genes.
1	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	RESULTS	The only significant genes outside the APOE cluster region were LINC00158 under plan 1 and LINC00158, MIR155HG, MIR155, LINC00515, MRPL39, and JAM2 under plan 3 that were located in the chromosome 21q21.3 region.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	None of the SNPs inside or within 1-Mb flanking regions of these genes had significant p values at the genome-wide level in our study, although several had suggestive-level p values in conducted meta-analyses under plans 1 and 3.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	Also, SNPs in 1-Mb nearby regions of these genes were only nominally associated with AD (8.0E-04 < p < 5E-02) in previous studies.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	rs239713	RESULTS	However, the chromosome 21q21.3 region was associated with AD by previous GWAS at a suggestive level of associations (rs239713 with p = 5.00E-07).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	This SNP is located ~ 1.6 Mb away from significant genes reported in our study
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	We found that 19, 10, and 19 pathways were significantly associated with AD under plans 1-3, respectively (Table 4).

0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We found that 12 pathways were significant under two or three analysis plans (i.e., they were not plan specific).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	There were also seven pathways that were significant only under plan 1 (males and females), and seven others were significant only in females (i.e., plan 3).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	No pathways were specifically significant in males (i.e., plan 2)
0	NA	SMR	NA	RESULTS	Using eQTLs data from peripheral blood, we found that four, eight, and four probes/genes passed both the SMR (PSMR < 6.03E-05) and HEIDI (PHEIDI >= 0.05) tests under plans 1-3, respectively.
0	NA	SMR	NA	RESULTS	The significant FDR level for interpreting the results from the SMR test was set to 0.05 under plan 1 and 0.025 under plans 2 and 3 to ensure that the expected number of false-positive findings was < 1.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Table 5 presents information about these 16 probes/genes, their top eQTLs, and the respective p values.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The top eQTLs corresponding to these probes/genes were all nominally significant in our GWA analyses (2.01E-04 <= PGWAS <= 2.47E-02).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Moreover, we did not identify any SNPs with significant p values at the genome-wide significance level within 1 Mb of these genes.
0	Alzheimer's disease	MS4A6A	NA	RESULTS	However, several SNPs within 1 Mb of MS4A6A and UQCC were associated with AD with p < 5E-08 in previous studies.

0	Alzheimer's disease	ATG10	NA	RESULTS	Also, ATG10 was significantly associated with AD in the nucleus accumbens and putamen basal ganglia.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The corresponding top eQTLs were nominally significant in our GWA analyses in males and females (4.30E-05 <= PGWAS <= 9.33E-02).
0	NA	ATG10	NA	RESULTS	There were no SNPs with significant p values at the genome-wide significance level within 1 Mb of these genes in our study; however, SNPs with significant p values at the suggestive level of significance were found in flanking regions of ATG10 in the nonreplicated set of SNPs in females (see Additional file 4).
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	In addition, the SNPs within 1 Mb of these four genes were only nominally associated with AD in previous studies.
0	Alzheimer's disease	ATG10	NA	RESULTS	In terms of chromosomal regions, in addition to ATG10 as explained earlier, SNPs in the chromosome 11q24.3 region (PRDM10 gene) were also previously associated with AD at a genome-wide significance level

0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The genetic architecture of AD has been widely studied in recent years, and so far more than 60,000 SNPs have been associated with AD with p < 0.05.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Of these, 281 SNPs (mapped to 49 genes) and 593 SNPs (mapped to 165 genes) had significant p values at the genome-wide and suggestive levels of associations, respectively.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Despite these efforts, a major proportion of h2 of AD has remained unexplained.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Exploring the genetic risk factors contributing to AD is highly important from a precision medicine perspective where the goal is to personalize diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The current study provides further insight into the genetic architecture of AD through GWA, TWA, gene-based, and pathway-based analyses of four independent datasets.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	These datasets, particularly the LOADFS cohort, were partially used in previous genetic studies of AD
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our GWA analyses corroborated the associations of a number of previously detected AD loci and revealed some significant novel association signals.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Among previously detected AD-associated SNPs, we found several SNPs with p values that were smaller than those reported before.
1	NA	NA	rs2965169	DISCUSS	Also, the significant association signals for three SNPs inside the chromosome 19q13 region (i.e., nonreplicated rs2965169 SNP under plan 1, rs10426423 from the meta-analysis set of SNPs under plan 1, and rs769450 from the replicated set of SNPs under plan 1 and the nonreplicated sets of SNPs under plans 2 and 3) were previously reported only in African-Americans (p = 2.6E-8, p = 9.9E-7, and p = 5.3E-27, respectively).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Most newly detected AD-associated SNPs, particularly those outside the chromosome 19q13 region, can be considered informative AD markers because their p values in our study were smaller than those for other AD-associated loci in their 1-Mb upstream/downstream regions and they were not in LD with such loci.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	For instance, as seen in Table 2 that summarizes the replicated and meta-analysis sets of SNPs, 11, 4, and 21 novel AD-associated SNPs were detected under plans 1-3, respectively.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	These SNPs were mapped to 21 genes in 19 chromosomal regions (i.e., cytogenetic regions).
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Of these, four genes had been associated with AD in previous GWAS with p < 5E-06.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Also, nine genes were located in eight chromosomal regions that contained previously AD-associated SNPs that were > 1 Mb away from the SNPs detected in our study.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The other eight genes/regions had not been associated with AD in previous studies at genome-wide or suggestive levels of associations
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our GWA analyses also revealed associations of a number of SNPs (41, 33, and 40 SNPs under plans 1-3, respectively) with AD that were present only in one of the four investigated cohorts.
0	multifactorial disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	While successful replication of a discovered association in an independent cohort has become the gold standard in genome-wide association studies for substantiating the real genetic effects, failure to replicate SNP-disease associations does not necessarily indicate that they are false-positive findings.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Instead, they might be real genetic contributors that confer population-specific risks due to the genetic heterogeneity of the disease.
0	insufficient	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Other reasons for nonreproducibility can be the lack of statistical power due to insufficient sample sizes, the presence of environmental or gene-gene interactions, and a lack of genotyping information for particular loci in different studies.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	For instance, small between-population allele frequency differences at an interacting locus may result in a lack of power to detect the main effect of a genuine association signal in independent cohorts.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	These reasons can also justify why not all previously discovered AD-associated SNPs were replicated in our study
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Of particular interest was to investigate the sex disparity in the genetic basis of AD.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Addressing sex differences in biomedical research has been emphasized by the National Institutes of Health as an approach that can eventually bolster the personalized medicine paradigm.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our results revealed a number of new sex-specific genetic contributors to AD at the SNP, gene, and transcriptome levels.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	For instance, most of the newly detected SNPs, particularly SNPs outside chromosome 19q13, were sex specific as they had significant p values either in males or females and, in addition, their odds ratios were significantly different between the two genders.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Interestingly, there were two additional subsets of SNPs that were nominally associated with AD in all datasets in one sex while they were nonsignificant in all datasets in the other.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Such consistent sex-specific association signals, although weak, might be important in exploring the differences in genetic risk factors of AD between males and females and may demonstrate genome-wide significance in larger samples.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Another level of sex disparity was observed in the gene-based and TWA analyses where several genes were significantly associated with AD in either males or females.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Also, there were several pathways that were specifically significant in females.

0	Alzheimer's disease	SMR	NA	DISCUSS	Also, using eQTLs data from peripheral blood, the expression level of 17 probes/genes passed both the SMR and the HEIDI tests, indicating that variants influencing the expression of these genes may also have pleiotropic effects on developing AD.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	It should be noted that due to the tissue-specific expression of genes, using data from eQTLs studies on blood is not ideal for capturing associations between the transcriptome levels and AD.
0	NA	SMR	NA	DISCUSS	However, it increases the power of SMR analysis since such studies take advantage of more samples compared to brain-specific eQTLs studies.
0	NA	MS4A6A	NA	DISCUSS	Significant SNPs with p < 5E-08 were detected within 1 Mb of MS4A6A and UQCC genes (significant in TWA analyses of blood eQTLs data) in our GWAS or previous reports.
0	NA	ATG10	NA	DISCUSS	SNPs with p < 5E-06 were present only in 1-Mb upstream/downstream regions of ATG10 (significant in brain-specific TWA analyses) in our GWA analyses of females, although several AD-associated SNPs with p < 5E-06 were reported in regions around TRA2A, IRAK3, and ESPN.
0	insufficient	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This is likely indicative of the lack of power of conducted GWAS due to insufficient sample sizes
0	NA	MS4A6A	NA	DISCUSS	Taken together, all AD-associated genes in our TWA analyses except MS4A6A and UQCC can be considered novel potential AD-associated genes.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Further functional analyses are needed to explore their potential roles in AD pathogenesis as detected associations do not imply causation.

0	Alzheimer's disease	CRIPAK	rs1923775	DISCUSS	Also, rs1923775 located ~ 700 kb away from CRIPAK has shown relatively strong association (p = 5.60E-6) with AD in African Americans
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Of 26 pathways that were significantly associated with AD in our pathway-based analyses, 12 were not plan specific, seven were specifically significant only under plan 1 (males and females), and seven were specifically significant only in females (i.e., plan 3).
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Pathways that were significant in more than one plan were mostly involved in processes such as mitochondrial function, lipid metabolism, cell junctions, and immune and inflammatory responses that were implicated in AD.

0	NA	NA	NA	CONCL	In summary, our study revealed significant associations of several SNPs at genome-wide or suggestive levels of significance which were not reported before.
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	CONCL	Most of the SNPs that were located outside the APOE cluster gene region were not in LD with previously discovered AD-associated polymorphisms that had p < 5E-06 (Table 2).
0	NA	NA	NA	CONCL	These SNPs were mapped to 21 genes in 19 chromosomal regions.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	CONCL	Of these, 8 genes/regions had not been associated with AD in previous GWAS with p < 5E-06.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	CONCL	Also, 26 genes located outside the chromosome 19q13 region, and 26 pathways, showed evidence of associations with AD at the FDR level of 0.05 in our TWA, gene-based, and pathway-based analyses.
0	NA	NA	NA	CONCL	Thirteen of these 26 genes were located in chromosomal regions with no AD-associated SNPs at the genome-wide or suggestive level of significance.
0	NA	NA	NA	CONCL	Most of the significantly detected SNPs and genes as well as several AD-associated pathways were sex specific, indicating sex disparities in the genetic basis of AD.
0	NA	NA	NA	CONCL	By detecting a number of novel potential AD-associated SNPs and discovering suggestive associations of several genes and transcripts, our study provides new insight into the genetic architecture of AD.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	CONCL	Particularly, identifying sex-specific genetic contributors can advance our understanding of AD pathogenesis
0	NA	NA	NA	CONCL	Despite the rigor of this study, there are some limitations.
0	NA	NA	NA	CONCL	The case/control status in the four cohorts used in this study was mainly determined clinically.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	CONCL	The routine clinical diagnosis of AD based on the symptoms and neurologic examinations may not provide the optimal case/control classification.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	CONCL	Instead, the National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association suggested that integrating additional paraclinical tests (e.g., histopathologic findings in brain biopsy, measuring AD-related cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, or detecting neurodegeneration by the imaging study) into the diagnostic protocols can aid researchers to more accurately identify AD patients and healthy controls.
0	NA	NA	NA	CONCL	Beach et al.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	CONCL	investigated the accuracy of clinical diagnosis of AD by comparing such diagnoses to the histopathology findings from brain autopsies in a sample of 1198 subjects.
0	NA	NA	NA	CONCL	They found that the sensitivity and specificity of clinical diagnostic classification were 70.9-87.3% and 44.3-70.8%, respectively, indicating a relatively high possibility of clinically false-negative and false-positive classification of subjects as controls and cases, respectively.
0	NA	NA	NA	CONCL	Finally, since the power of GWA analyses is affected by the sample sizes, and in particular the number of cases, the current study with 2741 cases and 14,739 controls may not have the optimal power.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	CONCL	Further studies, possibly with larger sample sizes, are needed to clarify the genotype-phenotype relationships in AD
