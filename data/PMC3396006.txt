0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Prostate cancer (PrCa) is the most frequently diagnosed male cancer in developed countries.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	To identify common PrCa susceptibility alleles, we conducted a multi-stage genome-wide association study and previously reported the results of the first two stages, which identified 16 novel susceptibility loci for PrCa.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Here we report the results of stage 3 in which we evaluated 1,536 SNPs in 4,574 cases and 4,164 controls.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Ten novel association signals were followed up through genotyping in 51,311 samples in 30 studies through the international PRACTICAL consortium.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	In addition to previously reported loci, we identified a further seven new prostate cancer susceptibility loci on chromosomes 2p, 3q, 5p, 6p, 12q and Xq (P=4.0 x10-8 to P=2.7 x10-24).
0	NA	TERT	NA	ABSTRACT	We also identified a SNP in TERT more strongly associated with PrCa than that previously reported.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	More than 40 PrCa susceptibility loci, explaining ~25% of the familial risk in this disease, have now been identified
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide a powerful approach to identify common disease alleles.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We previously conducted a GWAS based on genotyping of 541,129 SNPs in 1,854 clinically detected PrCa cases and 1,894 controls (stage 1).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In a second stage, 43,671 SNPs showing evidence for association in stage 1 were genotyped in 3,650 PrCa cases and 3,940 controls (stage 2).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	These studies, together with further follow-up through the PRACTICAL consortium identified 16 PrCa susceptibility loci.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Taken together with loci identified through other GWAS, more than 30 PrCa susceptibility loci have been reported, and these account for approximately 23% of the familial risk of the disease
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Since the risks associated with common susceptibility alleles are modest (per-allele odds ratios, OR, ranging from 1.10-1.25), it is likely that other PrCa predisposition loci will have been missed by previous studies, and that such loci should be detectable by studies with larger sample sizes.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We therefore conducted a more extensive follow-up of SNPs showing evidence of association in our GWAS.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We first used imputation, utilising the HapMap phase II CEU data as a reference, to estimate genotypes in our stage 1 and 2 data at ~2.6M SNPs.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	To improve power, we then combined these data with imputed data from the Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS;) PrCa study, a GWAS of 1,117 PrCa cases and 1,105 controls, using a stratified 1df P-trend (see statistical methods)
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We used these combined results to select SNPs for a stage 3 analysis.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We selected 1,263 SNPs based on their ranked P-values, together with 178 additional SNPs selected for fine-mapping of three regions, of known susceptibility loci or from candidate gene studies (see methods).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	These SNPs were genotyped using an Illumina Golden Gate assay in 4,999 PrCa cases and 4,939 controls from the United Kingdom (UK) and Australia (see Methods and Supplementary Notes.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	After quality control (QC) exclusions (see Methods), data were utilised from 1,347 SNPs in 4,574 PrCa cases and 4,164 controls (Supplementary Figure 1).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Genotype frequencies in cases and controls were compared using a 1 degree of freedom (df) Cochran-Armitage trend test, stratified by study
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	After exclusion of SNPs in previously known susceptibility regions, there was a clear excess of nominally significant associations in stage 3, with 11 SNPs significant at P<0.001 (in 7 regions on chromosomes 2, 5, 6 and 12) compared with 1.1 that would be expected by chance.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We then combined data from the stage 3 with those from the previous stages and with the CGEMS data.
0	NA	P<10-7	NA	INTRO	In the combined dataset, we identified 16 SNPs from 10 regions in which the highest ranking SNP reached a significance of P<10-7 in the combined analysis or P<10-3 in stage 3.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that a single SNP was sufficient to explain the association signal at each region, in that no further SNPs were significantly associated with risk after adjustment for the most strongly associated SNP
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	These 10 SNPs were then subjected to further replication analysis (stage 4) in an international study, involving 26,055 cases and 25,256 controls from 30 studies participating in the PRACTICAL Consortium (Supplementary Figure 1 and Supplementary Notes).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Nine SNPs showed evidence of replication in stage 4 (P<=0.007) each in the same direction as in stages 1-3, with a significance of P=4.0 x10-8 to P= 2.7 x10-24 in a combined analysis across all stages (Table 1., Fig 1. and Supplementary Figure 1).
0	NA	NA	rs37181	INTRO	"rs37181 on 5q22 showed no evidence of association in stage 4 and did not reach ""genome-wide"" significance in an overall combined analysis (P=.17 in stage 4, P=5.3x10-5 overall)."
0	NA	NA	rs7584330	INTRO	Of the nine loci reaching genome-wide significance, SNP rs7584330 is in the same region as a locus recently reported in a parallel GWAS of PrCa (Schumacher et al, Hum Mol Genet.

0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The second stage of that study also included data from stages 1 and 2 of our GWAS.
0	NA	NA	rs2292884	INTRO	The associated SNP in that study, rs2292884, is in LD with rs7584330 (r2=0.59) reported here and is likely to reflect the same signal, although rs7584330 exhibited a stronger association in our GWAS (Supplementary Figure 2. a)
1	NA	TERT	rs2242652	INTRO	SNP rs2242652 on 5p15 lies in intron 3 of TERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase) (Figure 2.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	a.).
0	cancers	NA	NA	INTRO	SNPs in this region have been associated with multiple cancers, including basal cell carcinoma, lung cancer, bladder cancer, glioma and testicular cancer.
0	NA	NA	rs401681	INTRO	Some evidence for an association with PrCa risk has also previously been reported for SNPs rs401681 and rs2736098 in this region (P=3.6x10-4 and P=1.3x10-4).
1	NA	NA	rs2242652	INTRO	In contrast, we found much stronger evidence of an association with SNP rs2242652 in the same region.
1	NA	NA	rs2242652	INTRO	The novel SNP identified in this GWAS, rs2242652, is weakly correlated with the previously reported rs401681 (r2= 0.19) and showed a much stronger association with PrCa risk in our original GWAS (P =9.8 x10-11 in stages 1, 3 and CGEMS vs. P=0.001 for rs401681).
1	NA	NA	rs2242652	INTRO	Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that rs2242652 was associated with PrCa risk after adjustment for rs401681 (P= 4.6x10-9 and P= 0.07 respectively).
1	NA	NA	rs2242652	INTRO	In a stepwise logistic regression including both SNPs, rs2242652 alone remained in the model (P= 4.4x10-11).
1	NA	NA	rs2242652	INTRO	rs2242652 is also modestly correlated with rs2736098 (r2=0.10), although the latter SNP was not genotyped in any stage of our GWAS.
1	NA	NA	rs2242652	INTRO	Thus, rs2242652 may be more strongly correlated to the variant(s) causally related to PrCa risk than either rs401681 or rs2736098.
0	cancers	TERT	NA	INTRO	This may also indicate that the variant(s) functionally related to PrCa risk in the TERT region differs from those for other cancers.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The major role of telomerase is to catalyze the de novo addition of telomeric repeat sequences onto chromosome ends and thereby counterbalance telomere-dependent replicative ageing.
0	cancers	TERT	NA	INTRO	Several studies have reported an association between short telomeres and increased risk of cancer at several sites although the cancer-associated SNPs in TERT have thus far not been associated with telomere length
0	cancers	NA	NA	INTRO	All but one of the autosomal SNPs associated with PrCa risk exhibit a pattern of association consistent with a log-additive model, as observed for most common cancer susceptibility alleles (Supplementary Table 1).
1	NA	NA	rs2121875	INTRO	For rs2121875 at 5p12, the estimated OR in stage 4 for rare allele homozygotes is 1.14 (95%CI 1.07-1.21) which was greater than expected under a log-additive model (P=0.02)
1	NA	NA	rs2121875	INTRO	There was some evidence for a difference in the per-allele ORs among European, Asian and African-American populations for rs2121875 (P=0.03 for heterogeneity in the OR by population, Supplementary Table 2).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	However, the sample sizes for the Asian and African-American populations were too small to evaluate the associations in these populations reliably
0	NA	PSA	NA	INTRO	We were able to examine the associations between genotypes of the 10 SNPs selected for replication in PRACTICAL and serum PSA levels in 1089 control samples from stage 3 of our scan and 1540 controls from stage 4 (Supplementary Table 3).
1	NA	TERT	rs2242652	INTRO	One SNP, rs2242652 (chromosome 5p15, TERT) showed an association with PSA level (P=0.006), in the direction consistent with its association with PrCa risk
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Data on Gleason score were available for 19,959 PrCa European cases.
1	NA	NA	rs5919432	INTRO	There was some evidence of a higher per-allele OR for Gleason score >= 8 disease for one SNP, rs5919432 (Xq12; Supplementary Table 4).
0	aggressive disease	NA	NA	INTRO	This general lack of association with aggressiveness is broadly consistent with the other susceptibility loci identified through GWAS.
1	NA	NA	rs10187424	INTRO	Four SNPs, however, showed evidence of a differential association with age, in each case with bigger effect (smaller or bigger OR) at younger ages: rs10187424 (2p11.2; P=0 .02), rs2242652 (5p15.33; P=0.01), rs130067 (6p21.33; P=0.03), and rs5919432 (Xq12; p=0.04) (Supplementary Table 5).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	This age effect has not been seen consistently for previously identified susceptibility SNPs, but would be consistent with the higher familial relative risks at younger age.
1	NA	NA	rs10187424	INTRO	In addition, four SNPs exhibited stronger associations when analyses were restricted to cases with a family history of PrCa: rs10187424 (2p11.2; P=.006), rs7584330 (2q37.2; P=0.01), rs6763931 (3q23; P =0.03) and rs130067 (6p21.33; P=0.002).
