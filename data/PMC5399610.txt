0	NA	T2D loci and 2	NA	INTRO	To further understand the genetic basis of T2D in U.S. Hispanics/Latinos of diverse backgrounds, we conducted a GWAS including 2,499 T2D case subjects and 5,247 control subjects from the HCHS/SOL with the purpose of 1) searching for novel T2D loci and 2) examining previously known T2D loci in U.S. Hispanics/Latinos
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The HCHS/SOL is a population-based study of 16,415 Hispanic/Latino adults, 18-74 years old, living in four U.S. metropolitan areas (Bronx, NY; Chicago, IL; Miami, FL; and San Diego, CA).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	A comprehensive battery of interviews relating to personal and family characteristics and health status and behaviors, as well as a clinical assessment with blood draw, were conducted at an in-person clinic baseline visit during 2008-2011.

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Genetic analysis groups (Hispanic/Latino background groups: Cuban, Dominican, Puerto Rican, Mexican, Central American, or South American) were constructed based on a combination of self-identified Hispanic/Latino background and genetic similarity
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We used the generalized linear mixed model association test (GMMAT) to test SNP-T2D genome-wide associations using the score test applied on a logistic model.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Our study had a power of 80% to detect a genetic variant that could explain 0.64% variance of T2D on a liability scale, at the genome-wide significance level (P < 5.0 x 10-8).

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The model also included center, age, sex, the first five PCs to adjust for ancestry, and sampling weights
1	NA	KCNQ1	NA	METHODS	Conditional analyses were performed at the KCNQ1 locus using GMMAT, with known index SNP and lead SNPs as covariates.
1	NA	KCNQ1	NA	METHODS	We identified haplotypes of KCNQ1 based on four SNPs using the phased imputation data.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Haplotypes that appeared at least 50 times in both case and control subjects were tested for associations with T2D using GMMAT, with the most common haplotype as a reference
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	For 80 known index SNPs identified and/or summarized in previous studies, we used GMMAT to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CI per risk allele of each SNP on T2D.

1	NA	TCF7L2	rs7903146	RESULTS	There were two genome-wide significant T2D loci (P < 5.0 x 10-8), and both are known: TCF7L2 (lead SNP rs7903146, P = 1.3 x 10-11) and KCNQ1 (lead SNP rs2283228, P = 8.4 x 10-13) (Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	2).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Further adjustment for BMI did not change the results materially
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We then evaluated association results at 80 known T2D loci to examine whether lead SNPs in the HCHS/SOL are different from the reported index SNPs.
1	NA	TCF7L2	NA	RESULTS	There were eight loci with lead SNPs of P < 6.25 x 10-4 (Bonferroni adjustment for 80 tested loci), four of which (TCF7L2, INS-IGF2, KCNQ1, and MTNR1B) reached significance after correction for the number of independent SNPs calculated using the simpleM methods at the respective locus (Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	3).
1	NA	INS	rs1049549	RESULTS	The observed lead SNPs in the HCHS/SOL were identical or in moderate-to-high linkage disequilibrium (LD) (r2 > 0.5) with known index SNPs at these loci, except SNP rs1049549 at INS-IGF2 and SNP rs2283228 at KCNQ1 (r2 < 0.2 with known index SNPs).
1	NA	INS	rs1049549	RESULTS	Of note, SNP rs1049549 is located between the INS-IGF2 and KCNQ1 genes and relatively closer to KCNQ1 than to INS-IGF2.
1	NA	KCNQ1	rs1049549	RESULTS	Thus, rs1049549 was considered as a SNP at the KCNQ1 locus in our following analyses
1	NA	KCNQ1	NA	RESULTS	Conditional analyses at the KCNQ1 locus also yielded two additional independent signals represented by SNP rs2283228/rs2237896 (in high LD with r2 = 0.83) and SNP rs1049549, respectively (Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	1 and Supplementary Table 2).
0	NA	NA	rs1049549	RESULTS	A potentially novel signal represented by SNP rs1049549 showed a significant association with T2D (OR 1.49 [95% CI 1.27-1.75]; P = 5.5 x 10-6) in primary analysis (Fig.
1	NA	NA	rs163184	RESULTS	1A), and the result did not change materially after conditioning on index SNP rs163184 (Fig.

0	NA	NA	rs1049549	RESULTS	The most common haplotype T-G-G-G in the HCHS/SOL (frequency 0.30) has nonrisk allele (C allele) of rs1049549 and risk alleles (G alleles) of other three SNPs for T2D.
0	NA	NA	rs1049549	RESULTS	The haplotype C-G-G-G, with the risk allele (C allele) of rs1049549, showed a significant association with increased T2D risk compared with the haplotype T-G-G-G (P = 9.6 x10-4)
0	NA	NA	rs1049549	RESULTS	Associations between SNP rs1049549 and T2D were highly consistent across Hispanic/Latino background groups (I2 = 0; Pheterogeneity = 0.77) (Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	2).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Previously inferred local ancestry estimates in the HCHS/SOL indicated that this C allele is an African ancestry-specific allele, with relative high frequency in African ancestry (minor allele frequency [MAF] 0.32) and very low frequency in European ancestry and Native American ancestry (MAF <0.02).

1	NA	KCNQ1	rs1049549	DISCUSS	In this GWAS of T2D in U.S. Hispanics/Latinos, we identified an independent association signal represented by an African ancestry-specific variant, SNP rs1049549, in addition to two known association signals at the KCNQ1 locus.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Consistent results across different Hispanic/Latino background groups and successful replication in African Americans from the MEDIA Consortium strengthened the reliability of this observed association.
1	NA	CD81	rs1049549	DISCUSS	SNP rs1049549 is located at the 3' untranslated region of CD81, ~3.3 kb upstream of TSSC4 and ~4.8 kb upstream of KCNQ1, which often contains regulatory elements (ENCODE databases can be found in the University of California, Santa Cruz, Genome Browser at https://genome.ucsc.edu/).
0	allergy	NA	rs1049549	DISCUSS	Further examination indicated that SNP rs1049549 is in a high LD with a set of SNPs (r2 > 0.8) clustered with regulatory elements, such as the transcription factor binding regions, DNase I hypersensitivity sites, and H3K27Ac mark
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	It is not surprising that only 14 known index SNPs formally generalized to the HCHS/SOL, due to limited power of our study.
1	NA	TCF7L2	rs7903146	DISCUSS	Top SNPs, TCF7L2 rs7903146 and KCNQ1 rs2283228, in our study explained 0.28% and 0.33% variance of T2D, respectively, indicating that our GWAS was underpowered.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, we demonstrated that both the GRS based on all 80 known index SNPs and the GRS that excluded generalized SNPs showed highly significant associations with T2D.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The observed effect of the GRS in U.S. Hispanics/Latinos (~7% increased risk of T2D per allele) is very similar to those observed in two large studies of Europeans and Chinese.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Consistent with previous studies, we found a stronger genetic association with T2D in leaner individuals, which might be driven by beta-cell function-related variants
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	One unique feature of our study is the diversity of Hispanic/Latino backgrounds, which have been rarely investigated in previous T2D GWAS.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This provides both challenges and advantages for genetic association studies.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Heterogeneity among diverse Hispanic/Latino groups may increase genomic inflation, confounding effects, or other artifacts and decrease statistical power, although appropriate statistical approaches have been applied to account for heterogeneous variances among groups in our genetic association analyses.
1	NA	KCNQ1	NA	DISCUSS	On the other hand, the diversity of Hispanic/Latino groups with different ancestries provides opportunities to identify potential ancestry-specific alleles (e.g., the newly identified African ancestry-specific allele at KCNQ1 in this study) and/or group-specific genetic effects in relation to human diseases.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our study, the largest study of U.S. Hispanics/Latinos of diverse backgrounds to date, is still limited by inadequate sample size.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Additional studies of U.S. Hispanics/Latinos are clearly needed to fill this gap
1	NA	KCNQ1	NA	DISCUSS	In summary, our study identified a potentially novel independent signal suggesting an African ancestry-specific allele at KCNQ1 for T2D and provides evidence for the similarity of known genetic predisposition to T2D between U.S. Hispanics/Latinos and other populations.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Larger meta-analyses of T2D GWAS efforts are needed to confirm our findings and identify more T2D loci among this understudied population
