0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The advent of large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and capability for imputation has made it possible to explore millions of polymorphisms in search of genetic determinants of phenotypic variation.
0	lung hypoplasia	APIP	NA	INTRO	Our previously reported GWAS in 3,444 CF patients led to identification of genome-wide significant single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations with lung disease severity in an intergenic region between EHF and APIP (chr11p13), as well as several additional suggestive loci (chr6p21.3 and chrXq22-q23).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In other published candidate gene studies, additional loci/genes have been reported to reach significance thresholds for the individual study, but many of these studies were based on relatively small sample sizes and/or limited phenotyping, and most have not been replicated, generating uncertainty as to their pathophysiological relevance
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In this manuscript, we have extended our study of CF gene modifiers by testing 2,921 additional patients from North America (n=1,699) and France (n=1,222).

0	exocrine pancreas	CFTR	F508del	RESULTS	In the combined GWAS1+2 data set, 99.8% of subjects were pancreatic exocrine insufficient (primarily defined by CFTR genotypes); 65.0% were p.Phe508del homozygotes; 95.5% were of European ancestry; and only 5.4% were diagnosed by newborn screening.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	GWAS1 subjects from three cohorts were genotyped on the same Illumina platform, while GWAS2 included 10 subgroups defined by different combinations of site and Illumina genotyping platforms.
0	lung hypoplasia	NA	NA	RESULTS	These 13 subgroups had similar distributions of the lung disease phenotype (Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	1)
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	To account for potential effect size heterogeneity, a random effects meta-analysis association model (Methods) was applied across the 13 subgroups.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Acknowledging that the power of fixed effects meta-analysis can be greater than that of random effects, even under heterogeneity, we also performed fixed effect meta-analysis, and report loci exceeding significance thresholds by either random or fixed effects analysis.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Analysis included 8,520,458 genotyped and imputed SNPs with minor allele frequency >0.005 and markers with imputation r2>0.3.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Principal component-based stratification control was used (genomic control lambda=0.95) (Methods and Supplementary Figs 2 and 3).
0	NA	P<1.25	F508del	RESULTS	We considered loci with P<1.25 x 10-8 to be genome-wide significant, based on the standard for genome-wide significance (P=5 x 10-8) and multiplicity correction for CFTR genotype (all genotypes versus p.Phe508del homozygotes) and model (random versus fixed effects).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Associations in five regions (chr3q29, chr5p15, chr6p21, chr11p12-p13 and chrXq22-q23) exceeded genome-wide significance (Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	1).
0	NA	CFTR	NA	RESULTS	Only the chr11p12-p13 locus provides significant evidence of interaction with CFTR (P=0.048, from a Wald test of the interaction term in the linear mixed model that is then meta-combined using the inverse variance-based weighting).
0	NA	NA	F508del	RESULTS	This result corroborates our prior observation that association at this locus achieves a lower P value in p.Phe508del homozygous subjects than in all subjects
0	NA	HLA-DRA	NA	RESULTS	Each of the regions contained at least one genotyped SNP achieving significance (Table 2), except for chr6p21.3 near HLA-DRA.

1	NA	MUC4	NA	RESULTS	A formal test (Cochran's Q test) revealed that only the MUC4 locus has significant evidence of heterogeneity (P=0.04); the inconsistent association among subgroups may be due to the small sample size of some of these cohorts.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	All five regions all remained significant when restricted to 6,079 individuals determined by principal components to be of European ancestry (Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Fig.

1	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The remaining locus (chrX; AGTR2/SLC6A14) achieved suggestive evidence of association in the North American cohort with compelling evidence of replication in the French subjects (Methods and Supplementary Table 2)
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Conditioning on the most significant SNP in the five regions that had genome-wide significance eliminated significant association in three regions (chr3q29; chr6p21; chrXq22-q23), but not for chr5p15 or chr11p12-p13.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	On chr5p15 (Supplementary Fig.
1	NA	SLC9A3	rs57221529	RESULTS	5a), conditioning on rs57221529 (located 5' of SLC9A3 and CEP72) revealed significantly associated SNPs 3' of SLC9A3 (near AHRR), suggesting a complex contribution by genes and/or regulatory domains in the region.
0	NA	APIP	rs10742326	RESULTS	Similar complex mechanisms may be at play on chr11p12-p13, as conditioning on rs10742326 (in EHF/APIP intragenic region) revealed significantly associated SNPs 3' of APIP (Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	5b)
0	NA	CFTR	NA	RESULTS	As this study has the largest assembly of CF patients for modifier identification, we employed a combined test for association between CFTR variants and lung function, using the maximal unrelated sample of patients from GWAS1+2 (n=5,762).
0	NA	CFTR	NA	RESULTS	Summing the association test statistics (the square of the association Z-statistic) for each SNP in/near CFTR enabled capture of the combined effect of disease-causing mutations (Methods).
0	lung hypoplasia	CFTR	NA	RESULTS	Overall, this gene-based (CFTR) statistic showed that CFTR and lung disease severity are associated (P=0.0043, from a permutation-based test that is then meta-combined using Stouffer's Z-score method), but the evidence is very modest compared to the evidence for multiple modifier loci reported here.
0	lung hypoplasia	NA	F508del	RESULTS	As expected, this association with lung disease was not present when we restricted analysis to the p.Phe508del homozygotes (n=3,815; P=0.1604, from a permutation-based test that is then meta-combined using Stouffer's Z-score method)
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	To determine whether the most significantly associated GWAS SNPs show evidence as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in lung or immune cells, we examined three available databases for eQTLs (Genotype-Tissue Expression, GTEx, http://www.gtexportal.org/home/; University of Chicago SNP and CNV Annotation Database, SCAN, http://eqtl.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/gbrowse/eqtl/; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill seeQTL, http://www.bios.unc.edu/research/genomic_software/seeQTL/).

0	NA	HLA	NA	RESULTS	The most significant eQTLs were noted at the chr6 (human leukocyte antigen (HLA) Class II) locus (DRB1 and DRB5) and the chr11 locus (APIP).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The nominal P values from association testing in a linear regression model for eQTLs at other loci were modest (P>10-5), and of uncertain biological significance (Supplementary Table 3)
0	CF lung disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	We also compared the results of the GWAS1+2 analysis with variants in 30 candidate genes or loci previously reported to associate (nominal P<0.05) with some aspect of CF pulmonary disease phenotype (Supplementary Table 4).
1	NA	SLC9A3	NA	RESULTS	For previously reported candidate gene SNP associations, only those in SLC9A3 demonstrated significance (after correction for multiplicity of replication testing) in GWAS1+2, although others trended towards nominal significance.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	It is important to recognize that none of these studies used precisely the same lung phenotype as GWAS1+2, that each study involved substantially fewer subjects than the 6,365 individuals studied here, and that other SNPs in these candidate regions were not assessed here.

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Under this design, four of the five loci (chr3q29, chr5p15, chr6p21, and chr11p12-p13) achieved genome-wide significance (P<5 x 10-8) in the North American sample with independent replication in the French subjects (P=8.7 x 10-5, 0.003, 0.054 and 0.003, respectively; Supplementary Table 2).
1	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The AGTR2/SLC6A14 locus achieved suggestive evidence of association in the North American cohort (P=9.8 x 10-7) with compelling evidence of replication in the French subjects (1.8 x 10-4).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Note that one locus (chr11p12-p13) had previously achieved genome-wide significance in the discovery sample and replication sample in a study of North American subjects.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	In the current study, the EHF/APIP locus retains genome-wide significance in subjects from North America and the association is replicated in the 1,222 French subjects (P=0.003)
0	lung hypoplasia	CFTR	NA	METHODS	To assess whether variability in lung disease is associated with CFTR genotype within our sample of individuals with severe (pancreatic insufficient) mutations, we used gene-based association analysis.
0	NA	CFTR	NA	METHODS	From our imputed SNP set, there were 539 SNPs annotated to CFTR (+/- 10 kb).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We constructed a gene-based test statistic in the maximal set of unrelated individuals in each of the 13 subgroups (n=5,762), and restricted to this unrelated set for ease of permutation.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	To compute the gene-based test statistic, we obtained residuals by regressing the Consortium lung phenotype (KNoRMA) and each SNP genotype on the principal components and sex.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The association test statistic between the residualized phenotype and residualized SNP was computed, squared and then summed across the 539 SNPs.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We used permutation to obtain subgroup-specific permuted statistics, permuting the residualized phenotype 10,000 times to obtain 10,000 gene-based sum statistics under the null hypothesis of no association to obtain P values for each subgroup, which preserves the linkage disequilibrium structure in the region.
0	NA	CFTR	NA	METHODS	The P value was calculated as the proportion of sum statistics from the 10,000 permutations that were more extreme than the observed CFTR sum statistic.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Stouffer's Z-score method was used to combine P values from each subgroup and weight them by their respective sample sizes
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	To estimate the proportion of variability in Consortium lung phenotype that is explained by our five significant regions, we conducted an association analysis using the maximum set of unrelated individuals in each subgroup, using the five SNPs from Table 2 in the regression model.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Then we calculated an average r2, weighted by sample size
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We searched for eQTLs for the top-ranked SNP in each of five loci, and for local SNPs in r2 (LD)>0.6 with the top-ranked GWAS SNPs, using three publicly available databases (Genotype-Tissue Expression, GTEx, lung and whole blood; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill seeQTL, HapMap LCL and Zeller monocyte; University of Chicago SNP and CNV Annotation Database, SCAN, HapMap CEU LCL).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Genes and transcripts within 100 kb of the top-ranked SNPs in five loci were included.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Results are presented as nominal P values for each region, except Q values are given for the results from UNC seeQTL (Supplementary Table 3)
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	A literature search was conducted to identify previously published reports of variants associated with some aspect of pulmonary function with a significance value of P<0.05, from association testing in a regression model, (Supplementary Table 4).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The gene suggested as likely responsible for the associations was identified, and the chromosome on which it resides.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	For SNPs, the rs number was identified, along with other nomenclature (aliases) for the variant.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	A variety of phenotyping methods had been used in these studies, ranging from X-ray and clinical scores to objective measures of lung function, both cross-sectional and longitudinal.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The associating phenotypes are summarized under 'Phenotypes Tested' and the reported P value.
0	NA	NA	F508del	METHODS	The number of subjects analysed and the publication were defined and the P values for any of these SNPs that were tested in this study are given for all subjects (All) and for p.Phe508del homozygotes alone
