0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	None of the 11,133,962 tested SNPs achieved the statistical threshold of 5 x 10-8 for declaring genome-wide significance (Supplementary Figures 2 & 3).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	All SNPs with suggestive evidence for association at p < 10-5 (n = 46) were selected for further association testing in a first independent sample of 820 cases and 885 controls, the US-GoKinD (Supplementary Figure 1)
1	Kidneys in Diabetes	NA	rs11188343	RESULTS	After Bonferroni correction, three SNPs demonstrated significant association with diabetic nephropathy: rs11188343 (p = 9.06 x10-5), rs1326934 (p = 9.85 x 10-5) and rs4917695 (p = 1.27 x 10-4) (Supplementary Table 3).
1	NA	SORBS1	NA	RESULTS	These SNPs mapped to SORBS1 gene and were in nearly complete linkage disequilibrium (r2~ 1)
1	Kidneys in Diabetes	NA	NA	RESULTS	In the discovery GWAS, the minor rs1326934-C allele was less frequent in cases than in controls (0.34 vs. 0.43) and was associated with a decreased risk for diabetic nephropathy of OR = 0.70 [0.60 - 0.82] (p = 7.87 x 10-6).
1	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	In the first-stage population, consistent association was observed with the rs1326934-C allele at lower frequency in cases (combined statistical evidence for association of p = 3.52 x 10-9) (Table 1)
0	Kidneys in Diabetes	NA	rs13626934	RESULTS	To validate further the association of rs13626934 with diabetic nephropathy, we studied it in two additional case-control studies composed of 823 cases and 903 (UK-ROI) and 1,335 cases and 1,633 controls (FinnDiane) (Table 1).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	In UK-ROI, the same trend of association, though not significant (p = 0.15), was observed: the rs13626934-C allele was less frequent in cases than in controls (0.42 vs. 0.45).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	However, no association was observed in the FinnDiane population (p = 0.44) where the allele frequency of C allele was very similar in cases and controls (0.27 vs. 0.28)
0	Kidneys in Diabetes	NA	NA	RESULTS	Combining the results of the four studies into a fixed-effect meta-analysis leads to an overall OR for diabetic nephropathy of 0.84 [0.79-0.90] (p = 5.69 x 10-7).
0	Kidneys in Diabetes	NA	NA	RESULTS	However, this association was statistically heterogeneous across the four samples (p = 3.94 x 10-3), and the random-effect meta-analyzed OR for diabetic nephropathy was then 0.83 [0.72 - 0.96] (p = 0.009).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	When excluding FINNDIANE patients, meta-analyzed OR was 0.795 [0.733 - 0.861], (p = 2.40 x 10-8)
1	diabetes	SORBS1	NA	RESULTS	SORBS1 gene over-expression was observed in tubules of type 2 diabetes patients compared to controls (Figure 1a).
1	NA	SORBS1	NA	RESULTS	We also observed significant inverse correlation between SORBS1 expression and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (Figure 1b).
1	Kidneys in Diabetes	SORBS1	rs1326934	RESULTS	Among the other genes mapping within 250kb of rs1326934, SORBS1 was the one demonstrated the strongest correlation with eGFR in control and diabetic nephropathy tubule samples (Figure 1c).
1	NA	SORBS1	NA	RESULTS	SORBS1 was also found highly expressed in renal tubules and medium expressed in glomeruli at a protein level (www.proteinatlas.org)
0	Kidneys in Diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In this report, a multi-stage based GWAS looked for novel susceptibility genes associated with diabetic nephropathy in patients with type 1 diabetes.
1	Kidneys in Diabetes	SORBS1	rs1326934	DISCUSS	We did not detect any new loci passing genome-wide significance but observed promising evidence for association of SORBS1 rs1326934 (or any SNP in complete LD with it) with diabetic nephropathy, in three of four of the studied populations.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Given the frequency of the risk allele observed in our control populations (i.e.
0	Kidneys in Diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	~0.55) and the associated OR for diabetic nephropathy (~1.25), the population attributable risk of the identified polymorphisms would be 12%
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	No association was observed in the Finish population, which exhibited a marked difference in allele frequency at the candidate SNP compared to the three other studied populations.
1	NA	SORBS1	NA	DISCUSS	We further interrogated databases with genome-wide genotype and gene expression but did not observe any association in monocytes, macrophages, hepatocytes, adipocytes nor endothelial cells with the SORBS1 gene expression.
1	NA	SORBS1	rs1188343	DISCUSS	Nevertheless, the SORBS1 rs1188343 (in complete LD with the rs1326934) was predicted in the RegulomeDB database (http://regulome.stanford.edu) to be located at a potential binding site either for RFX3 or for histone interaction
0	Kidneys in Diabetes	SORBS1	NA	DISCUSS	The sorbin protein, coded by SORBS1, was found to be differentially up-regulated in glomeruli of rats with DN compared to rats without diabetic nephropathy.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	High tubular and moderate glomerular expression of sorbin protein was observed in human kidney samples.
1	diabetes	SORBS1	NA	DISCUSS	These findings from type 2 diabetes patients provide additional support for the association of SORBS1 with diabetic nephropathy.
1	NA	SORBS1	NA	DISCUSS	Gene expression changes of the SORBS1 were easier to detect in tubules, as SORBS1 has a higher tubular expression.
1	NA	SORBS1	NA	DISCUSS	Although SORBS1 expression was significantly up-regulated only in tubules, we cannot exclude the importance of glomerular SORBS1.
0	Kidneys in Diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Diabetic nephropathy not only involves glomeruli but also tubules, and genes identified through GWAS are likely to impact both renal structures
0	Kidneys in Diabetes	insulin	NA	DISCUSS	The function of sorbin is not fully established but we speculate it plays a key role in several processes involved in diabetic nephropathy including insulin resistance and cytoskeleton architecture.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Sorbin acts in the genesis of stress fibers and might then be involved in podocyte alterations of the slit diaphragm barrier
0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The lack of homogenous replicated associations in our work is unlikely due to clinical heterogeneity of the studied populations as the same definitions for type 1 diabetes and diabetic nephropathy were used.
1	NA	SORBS1	NA	DISCUSS	Conversely, the different patterns of allelic heterogeneity and LD across European populations may explain the lack of replication of the SORBS1 signal in the Finnish population.
1	Kidneys in Diabetes	SORBS1	NA	DISCUSS	Characterizing the exact variability at the SORBS1 locus is needed to validate SORBS1 as a new susceptibility gene for diabetic nephropathy and identify the disease-associated functional variant(s)
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The main limitation of the present study is its design.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We adopted a multi-stage strategy using all available GWAS resources imputed for 1000G reference dataset at the time this work was launched.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	A more powerful approach would have been to conduct a comprehensive meta-analysis of the four populations.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	An international initiative has been set up to overcome this limitation.
0	Kidneys in Diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Another caveat is that the diabetic nephropathy phenotype was defined by the presence of proteinuria, regardless renal function, and genetic susceptibility to proteinuria might differ from genetic predisposition to renal failure.
0	Kidneys in Diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, the diabetic nephropathy cohorts we used all had this combined diabetic nephropathy phenotype permitting international collaboration
