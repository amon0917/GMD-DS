1	NA	PKN1	NA	ABSTRACT	Here the authors perform an exome-wide analysis in a cohort of PDAC patients to identify three novel missense variants in PKN1, DOK2, and APOB genes, that are associated with PDAC risk
0	pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma	NA	NA	INTRO	Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal human cancers, with a 5-year overall survival rate of only ~5%.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The incidence of PDAC is rapidly increasing worldwide, and prevention or early diagnosis at a curable stage remains exceedingly difficult for this disease.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Therefore, PDAC has become the fourth leading cause of cancer-associated death in both men and women.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	Cigarette smoking, type 2 diabetes, obesity and several hereditary cancer syndromes represent major risk factors for PDAC.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Based on accumulating evidence, germline variants also play an important role in the development of this disease
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) from our group and other researchers, several susceptibility loci associated with PDAC risk were identified in populations of Asian and European ancestry populations.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	However, GWAS exclusively focused on common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with a minor allele frequency (MAF) > 5%, and the identified variants explained only a small fraction of the heritability for PDAC.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	"Low-frequency variants (defined here as an MAF of 0.1%-5%) or rare variants (defined here as a MAF < 0.1%) have essential effect size and may substantially contribute to the ""missing"" heritability."
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Therefore, identifying additional low-frequency or rare variants that increase the susceptibility to PDAC will deepen our understanding of the aetiology of this disease
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	"The Illumina HumanExome Beadchip (referred to as ""exome chip"" hereafter) platform is one approach that primarily focuses on low-frequency or rare variants in the exon regions of genes, which has been successfully used in numerous studies to identify a series of functional coding variants."
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In this study, we performed an exome-wide association analyses using this chip with 943 individuals with PDAC and 3908 healthy controls to identify protein-coding susceptibility loci in the Chinese population, followed by two independent replicate samples including 2142 cases and 4697 controls.
1	NA	PKN1	NA	INTRO	We identify three low-frequency missense variants in the protein kinase N1 (PKN1), the docking protein 2 (DOK2) and the apolipoprotein B (APOB) associated with the PDAC risk with genome-wide significance and relatively high effect sizes (odds ratio (OR) > 1.5) by an additive model in logistic regression analysis.
1	NA	PKN1	rs34309238	INTRO	Further functional analyses show that the PKN1 rs34309238 variant increases the level of phosphorylated PKN1 and thus enhances cells' proliferation by phosphorylating and activating the focal adhesion kinase (FAK)/phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT signalling pathway.

1	NA	PKN1	rs34309238	RESULTS	The most significant association was noted for rs34309238, which is located in the 11th exon of PKN1 in chromosome 19p13.12 (OR = 1.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.48-2.12, P = 5.35 x 10-10) by an additive model in logistic regression analysis.
