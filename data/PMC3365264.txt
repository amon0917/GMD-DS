1	Alzheimer's disease	apolipoprotein E	NA	ABSTRACT	In addition to apolipoprotein E (APOE), recent large genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified nine other genes/loci (CR1, BIN1, CLU, PICALM, MS4A4/MS4A6E, CD2AP, CD33, EPHA1 and ABCA7) for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD).
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	However, the genetic effect attributable to known loci is about 50%, indicating that additional risk genes for LOAD remain to be identified.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	In this study, we have used a new GWAS data set from the University of Pittsburgh (1291 cases and 938 controls) to examine in detail the recently implicated nine new regions with Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk, and also performed a meta-analysis utilizing the top 1% GWAS single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with P<0.01 along with four independent data sets (2727 cases and 3336 controls) for these SNPs in an effort to identify new AD loci.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	The new GWAS data were generated on the Illumina Omni1-Quad chip and imputed at ~2.5 million markers.
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	ABSTRACT	As expected, several markers in the APOE regions showed genome-wide significant associations in the Pittsburg sample.
1	NA	PICALM	NA	ABSTRACT	While we observed nominal significant associations (P<0.05) either within or adjacent to five genes (PICALM, BIN1, ABCA7, MS4A4/MS4A6E and EPHA1), significant signals were observed 69-180 kb outside of the remaining four genes (CD33, CLU, CD2AP and CR1).
1	NA	PPP1R3B	rs3848140	ABSTRACT	Meta-analysis on the top 1% SNPs revealed a suggestive novel association in the PPP1R3B gene (top SNP rs3848140 with P=3.05E-07).
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	The association of this SNP with AD risk was consistent in all five samples with a meta-analysis odds ratio of 2.43.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	This is a potential candidate gene for AD as this is expressed in the brain and is involved in lipid metabolism.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	These findings need to be confirmed in additional samples
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Alzheimer's disease (AD), especially the late-onset form (LOAD), is a complex multifactorial neurodegenerative disease and the leading cause of dementia among the elderly people.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Currently, there are ~5 million AD cases in the United States and about 35 million cases worldwide.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Due to its long clinical course, AD is a major public health problem.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Genetic susceptibility at multiple genes and interactions among them and/or environmental factors likely influence the risk of AD.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	AD has a strong genetic basis with heritability estimates up to 80%.
0	Alzheimer's disease	PSEN1	NA	INTRO	However, genetic variants in the four well-established genes for AD; amyloid precursor protein and presenilin 1 and 2 (PSEN1 and PSEN2) for the rare early-onset, and apolipoprotein E (APOE) for the common LOAD explain less than half of this heritability
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	To identify the remaining genes for the common LOAD, efforts have been focused on conducting genome-wide association studies (GWASs) because this approach is hypothesis free and conceptually would identify all known and unknown genes.
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	INTRO	However, with the exception of the APOE region, no other significant associations were replicated across these initial GWAS.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	This highlights the difficulties in identifying the remaining LOAD genes that are thought to make a relatively small contribution to the overall risk of disease and thus would require much large sample size than used in earlier GWASs.
1	NA	CR1	NA	INTRO	Recent large GWASs have identified nine additional genes/loci for LOAD, including CR1, BIN1, CLU (a.k.a.
1	NA	CLU	NA	INTRO	APOJ), PICALM, MS4A4/MS4A6E, CD2AP, CD33, EPHA1 and ABCA7.
0	Alzheimer's disease	apolipoprotein E	NA	INTRO	Although up to 80% of the AD risk is attributable to genetic factors, all of the known LOAD genes (including APOE and new ones) account for about 50% of the total genetic variance.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	This indicates that additional risk genes for LOAD remain to be identified

0	Alzheimer's disease	apolipoprotein E	NA	RESULTS	Since no other SNPs outside the APOE region were genome-wide significant in the Pittsburgh discovery sample, we performed a meta-analysis by combining the results of the top ~1% SNPs (~25 000) with P<0.01 of the discovery sample with the four existing data sets (2727 AD cases and 3336 controls) for these SNPs.
1	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	RESULTS	Of the known loci, APOE, BIN1 and PICALM revealed genome-wide significant associations along with five suggestive new loci with P<1E-05 in the meta-analysis (Table 1).

0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	The regional plots for the remaining four top AD loci are shown in Supplementary Figures 10-13.
0	Alzheimer's disease	apolipoprotein E	NA	RESULTS	To remove any variation in AD due to the established effect of APOE, we also analyzed the data after adjusting for the effect of APOE*4, but found no appreciable difference in P-values for the non-APOE loci (Table 1), indicating that their effects are independent of APOE
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In this study, we have used a new GWAS data set to (i) examine in detail the recently implicated nine new regions with AD risk, and to (ii) perform a meta-analysis utilizing the top 1% GWAS SNPs (~25 000) with P<0.01 along with four independent data sets for these SNPs in an effort to identify new AD loci
1	Alzheimer's disease	PICALM	NA	DISCUSS	Five of the nine loci are replicated in the Pittsburgh sample as we found multiple nominal significant SNPs in or around five genes (PICALM, BIN1, ABCA7, MS4A4/MS4A6E and EPHA1), suggesting that these are the relevant genes for AD in these regions.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	As associations in these genes have been validated in multiple studies, it is acceptable to consider P<0.05 statistically significant in follow-up studies like ours.
0	NA	CD33	NA	DISCUSS	However, the identity of the potential causal genes in the remaining four regions (CD33, CLU, CD2AP and CR1) is not clear in the Pittsburgh sample, as significant SNPs were observed 69-180 kb outside of these genes.
1	NA	PICALM	NA	DISCUSS	The power in our Pittsburgh sample to detect these nine loci for the effect sizes reported in a previous GWAS is 0.38, 0.43, 0.39, 0.31, 0.38, 0.30, 0.28, 0.28 and 0.47 for PICALM, BIN1, ABCA7, MS4A4, EPHA1, CD33, CLU, CD2AP and CR1, respectively.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Although the overall power is low and this would reduce our confidence in our negative results, it enhances the interest in our positive results even further
0	NA	CD33	NA	DISCUSS	There were only 11 SNPs present in the CD33 gene on the 1M chip.
0	NA	NA	rs3865444	DISCUSS	This may explain why we did not observe any significant SNP in this gene, although the reported genome-wide significant SNP (rs3865444) gave a P-value of 0.25 with the same effect size in our sample.
0	NA	CD33	NA	DISCUSS	Also, recombination is low in the CD33 region; thus, it is likely that functional SNPs may be present in a broader region around CD33.
0	NA	CLU	NA	DISCUSS	Although none of the small number of 15 SNPs present in the CLU gene on the 1M chip showed significant association at P<0.05, a number of them showed the trend of association reported in earlier studies.
0	NA	PTK2B	NA	DISCUSS	However, several SNPs in a nearby PTK2B gene that is expressed in adult brain, revealed significant associations.
0	Alzheimer's disease	CLU	NA	DISCUSS	Perhaps, genetic variations in the CLU and PTK2B genes, both of which are expressed in the brain, are relevant to AD risk and thus resequencing a broader region in and around these genes may reveal functional variants.
0	Alzheimer's disease	CLU	NA	DISCUSS	However, a recent sequencing study found no functional SNPs in the coding region of the CLU gene and, likewise, no significant association was found between the previously associated CLU SNPs with AD risk with expression quantitative trait loci, suggesting that the biological role of CLU is AD is not yet clear.
0	Alzheimer's disease	CD33	NA	DISCUSS	While findings in our sample suggest the involvement of broader regions around the CD33 and CLU genes, the evidence of association of the CR1 and CD2AP with AD is weak or absent
1	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The GWAS analysis in the Pittsburgh data set found only the APOE/TOMM40/APOC1 region to be genome-wide significant, which is due to the established association with the APOE*4 SNP.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Meta-analysis of the top 25 000 SNPs from the Pittsburgh GWAS data, in conjunction with four replication data sets revealed five suggestive non-APOE loci.
1	Alzheimer's disease	PPP1R3B	NA	DISCUSS	The top SNP was located in the PPP1R3B gene, which is a potential candidate gene for AD as it is expressed in human brain.
1	coronary artery disease	PPP1R3B	NA	DISCUSS	Genetic variation in PPP1R3B has been shown to be associated with plasma high density lipoprotein and cholesterol levels and the risk of coronary artery disease.
1	NA	Ppp1r3b	NA	DISCUSS	Overexpression of the mouse ortholog Ppp1r3b in mouse liver results in significantly lower high density lipoprotein levels.
1	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	As high density lipoproteins levels and particle size affect the clearance of beta-amyloid in mouse brain, it is conceivable that the PPP1R3B-associated effect on AD risk is mediated through its impact on high density lipoproteins levels.
1	NA	PPP1R3B	NA	DISCUSS	Although the association of the top PPP1R3B SNP did not meet the strict criteria for genome-wide significance, it was consistent in direction in all samples as reflected in Odds ratio values (see Table 1).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This suggests that this gene region should be followed up in additional samples.
0	Alzheimer's disease	apolipoprotein E	NA	DISCUSS	If these findings are confirmed, then this would be another cholesterol-related gene involved in AD along with APOE, CLU and ABCA7
0	Alzheimer's disease	apolipoprotein E	NA	DISCUSS	In conclusion, 6 of the 10 established AD loci, including the APOE locus, have been replicated in our new GWAS data set, while broader regions in the remaining four loci are suspected.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Although we did not identify additional non-APOE SNPs meeting a conservative threshold of genome-wide significance, we have identified five suggestive loci that warrant follow-up in additional samples
1	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	FIG	Quantile-quantile plots showing the observed versus the expected P-values in the University of Pittsburgh sample including all single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (a) and after removing SNPs in the APOE, CR1, BIN1, CLU, PICALM, MS4A4/MS4A6E, CD2AP, CD33, EPHA1 and ABCA7 regions (b).
0	NA	NA	NA	FIG	The red line shows the distribution under the null hypothesis
0	NA	NA	NA	FIG	Manhattan plots showing the genome-wide P-values in the University of Pittsburgh sample after adjusting for age (age-at-onset in cases), sex and principle components.
0	NA	NA	NA	FIG	Red line indicates genome-wide significant level (P<5E-08) and blue line indicates suggestive associations (P<1E-04) in the Pittsburgh sample
0	Alzheimer's disease	E*4	rs429358	FIG	Regional association plot on chromosome 19 including the best single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs429358 (E*4), for Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk in the University of Pittsburgh sample
1	Alzheimer's disease	PPP1R3B	rs3748140	FIG	Regional association plot on chromosome 8, including the best single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (rs3748140) for Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk in the PPP1R3B gene in the Pittsburgh sample (blue triangles), and meta-analysis (red dots)
