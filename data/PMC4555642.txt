0	breast cancer	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Survival after a diagnosis of breast cancer varies considerably between patients, and some of this variation may be because of germline genetic variation.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	We aimed to identify genetic markers associated with breast cancer-specific survival
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	We conducted a large meta-analysis of studies in populations of European ancestry, including 37954 patients with 2900 deaths from breast cancer.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Each study had been genotyped for between 200000 and 900000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the genome; genotypes for nine million common variants were imputed using a common reference panel from the 1000 Genomes Project.
0	NA	ER	NA	ABSTRACT	We also carried out subtype-specific analyses based on 6881 estrogen receptor (ER)-negative patients (920 events) and 23059 ER-positive patients (1333 events).

0	breast cancer	NA	rs2059614	ABSTRACT	We identified one new locus (rs2059614 at 11q24.2) associated with survival in ER-negative breast cancer cases (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.55 to 2.47, P = 1.91 x 10-8).
0	NA	ER	NA	ABSTRACT	Genotyping a subset of 2113 case patients, of which 300 were ER negative, provided supporting evidence for the quality of the imputation.

0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Survival after a diagnosis of breast cancer varies considerably between patients.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Many factors influence outcome in an individual patient, including inherited genetic variation.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	This hypothesis is supported by several lines of evidence.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	It has been shown that first-degree relatives with breast cancer have a correlated likelihood of dying from the disease.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Additionally, mouse strain is a determinant of metastatic progression in in vivo models.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	There are many mechanisms through which germline genetic variation might affect prognosis.
0	cancers	BRCA1	NA	INTRO	Some known disease susceptibility alleles confer differential risks of different tumor subtypes that are associated with different outcomes:for example, deleterious alleles of BRCA1 are associated with estrogen receptor (ER)-negative disease, and several common germline genetic variants that are associated with susceptibility to breast cancer have different risks of ER-positive and ER-negative disease.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Germline genotype could also affect the efficacy of adjuvant drug therapies or might influence tumor-host interactions, such as those involving the stroma surrounding a tumor or the host's immune response.
0	cancers	NA	NA	INTRO	The host genotype might also influence the propensity of a tumor to seed and grow at metastatic sites
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The association between common germline genetic variation and breast cancer-specific survival has been examined in many candidate gene studies.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	These studies have identified numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) possibly associated with outcome, but none have been conclusively replicated in further studies.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been very successful at identifying susceptibility alleles for a wide range of normal and disease phenotypes.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	However, GWAS of breast cancer survival published to date have had modest sample sizes and have not identified any confirmed associations.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	It is clear that the success of other GWAS has depended on large sample sizes.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	It is likely that large studies of survival time are required if alleles associated with prognosis in breast cancer are to be identified.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	We therefore pooled genotype data from multiple breast cancer GWAS discovery and replication efforts and linked these data to available survival time data for the case patients in order to maximize statistical power to detect associations

1	cancers	EI24	rs2059614	RESULTS	The risk allele of rs2059614 was associated with increased expression of EI24 and CHEK1 in normal breast epithelium adjacent to tumor from the METABRIC study (P = .002 and .007, respectively) (Supplementary Figure 7, available online).

0	FAP	EI24	rs148760487	RESULTS	IFIH or FAP might be the target of rs148760487, and EI24 might be the target of rs2059614 because the SNP is in an enhancer in endothelial cells that is predicted to regulate EI24
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This is the largest genetic association study of breast cancer prognosis to date.
0	NA	NA	rs148760487	DISCUSS	We identified one new locus (rs148760487 at 2q24.2) associated with breast cancer-specific survival in all breast cancer and one new locus (rs2059614 at 11q24.2) associated with breast cancer survival in ER-negative case patients at genome-wide levels of statistical significance.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, both these associations were based on imputed genotype data.
0	NA	NA	rs148760487	DISCUSS	Genotyping a subset of the case patients confirmed that the quality of the imputation was reasonable, but for one SNP (rs148760487), the association in the subset of samples with both genotyped and imputed data was weaker for the genotyped data.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Thus we are less confident that this represents a true positive.
0	NA	NA	rs2059614	DISCUSS	On the other hand, as would be expected for a true positive, the association of rs2059614 got stronger when comparing genotyped with imputed data, suggesting that this is a robust association
1	NA	KCNH7	rs148760487	DISCUSS	Two genes lie within the 1 MB region on chromosome 2 spanning rs148760487 to KCNH7 and BC042876.

0	NA	NA	rs1424760	DISCUSS	Another SNP in the same region, rs1424760, has been reported to be associated with serum phospholipid levels, but this SNP is only weakly correlated with rs148760487 (r 2 = 0.11)
0	NA	NA	rs2059614	DISCUSS	There are 18 genes in the genomic region 500 KB either side of rs2059614 in chromosome 11 (Supplementary Table 5, available online).
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Several of these are known to be involved in processes relevant to cancer, such as cell death and DNA damage responses.
1	NA	EI24	rs2059614	DISCUSS	Of particular interest are EI24 and CHEK1, as expression of both of these in normal breast epithelium is associated with rs2059614 genotype.
0	NA	EI24	NA	DISCUSS	Additionally, expression of EI24 is associated with relapse-free survival in both ER-positive case patients and ER-negative case patients.
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Furthermore, this genomic region, 11q24, is frequently altered in cancers
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Genome-wide association studies with large-scale replication have been extremely successful in identifying multiple variants associated with many different phenotypes.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	For example, more than 70 common variants are known to be associated with an altered risk of breast cancer.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In contrast, this study of breast cancer prognosis has identified just two variants associated at genome-wide statistical significance.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	There are several possible reasons for this difference.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Despite the large sample size used in these analyses, the power to detect association with breast cancer-specific survival is only modest (see Supplementary Figure 10, available online).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	All of the common alleles associated with disease susceptibility confer relative risks of less than 1.2, and most are associated with relative risks of less than 1.1.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Alleles such as these can be detected using case-control studies with a total sample size of approximately 100000.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, our analyses, based on 2900 breast cancer deaths, had limited power to detect alleles conferring hazard ratios of less than 1.2.
0	NA	MAF	NA	DISCUSS	Power to detect an allele with a hazard ratio greater than 1.5 was good (60% power if the MAF = 0.05, 100% power if the MAF > 0.1), suggesting that few such alleles are likely to exist
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Another issue affecting our ability to detect associations with prognosis is the heterogeneity of the phenotype.
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	A wide variety of factors influence survival time after diagnosis, including tumor biology and treatment.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, and different disease subtypes have different clinical outcomes.
0	NA	ER	NA	DISCUSS	Restricting the analyses to specific subtypes in addition to ER status would reduce this heterogeneity, but the sample size would also be greatly reduced as subtype-specific information is not available for all case patients in these analyses, and some subtypes are relatively uncommon
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our findings provide support for the hypothesis that germ line genetic variation influences outcome after a diagnosis of breast cancer.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Identification of novel germline genetic markers of breast cancer prognosis may help to elucidate molecular mechanisms of tumor progression and metastasis.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Ultimately this may lead to the identification of new targets for therapeutic interventions.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	It may also lead to insights into mechanisms driving the differential response to adjuvant therapies and thereby enable improved targeting of therapy.
