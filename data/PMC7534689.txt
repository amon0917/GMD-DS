0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The weights for non-8q24 risk alleles were marginal logORs from logistic regression adjusting for 10 PCs and age in UGPCS.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	For variants in the 8q24 region, we first obtained conditional logORs from the regression model in the forward-selection stepwise procedure, and then to correct for potential bias in effect estimation of newly discovered variants, we implemented a fully Bayesian version of a weighted correction.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The risk score was then categorized by percentile (<10%, 10-25%, 25-75%, 75-90%, >=90%) and the risk for each category was estimated relative to the interquartile range (25-75%) using logistic regression with covariates including 10 PCs and age.

0	NA	NA	rs7210100	RESULTS	Of the three African-specific risk alleles for PCa reported outside of 8q24, variant rs7210100 at 17q21 was not significantly associated with PCa risk (OR = 1.04, P = 0.86; RAF = 0.04), while the effect sizes for rs75823044 at 13q34 and rs78554043 at 22q12.1 were similar to those reported previously in men of African ancestry, with rs75823044 nominally statistically significant in UGCPS (rs75823044: OR = 2.02, P = 0.04; RAF = 0.01; rs78554043: OR = 1.53, P = 0.44; RAF = 0.01).

0	aggressive disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	We did not detect statistically significant differences in effect by aggressiveness for the 8q24 variants
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	In estimating a PRS for the 92 non-8q24 risk alleles, the mean weighted score was 6.70 for PCa cases and 6.25 for controls (P < 2.2x 10-16, t-test).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The average PRS increased to 10.09 in PCa cases and 9.24 in controls (P < 2.2 x 10-16, t-test) with the inclusion of the five risk alleles at 8q24 (Figure 2).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Similarly, for non-8q24 risk alleles, men in the top 10% PRS had a 2.9-fold (95% CI: 1.75, 4.97) elevated risk compared to those with the average risk (PRS in 25th-75th percentiles), which increased to 4.86 (95%CI: 2.70, 8.76) with the inclusion of risk alleles at 8q24 (Table 3).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Moreover, the AUC of the PRS also improved by adding the 5 8q24 variants, increasing from 0.67 (95%CI: 0.65, 0.71) to 0.73 (95%CI: 0.70, 0.76).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The PRS was equally associated with aggressive and non-aggressive PCa in case-case analysis (aggressive vs non-aggressive OR = 0.92, P = 0.49)
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	In the genome-wide analysis, only five SNPs, all located in the risk region at 8q24.21 (Supplementary Table S4, Supplementary Figure S3) were genome-wide significant.
0	NA	NA	rs72725854	RESULTS	Variant rs72725854 was found to be the most statistically significant in association with PCa risk (OR = 3.37, P = 2.14 x 10-11), with a risk allele frequency (RAF) of 0.14 in cases and 0.06 in controls.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	This variant is only found in men of African ancestry and is the most strongly associated risk variant for PCa found to date in men of African ancestry.

0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In this study, we characterized known genetic risk factors for PCa in Ugandan men.
0	NA	MAF	NA	DISCUSS	Of the 118 established risk alleles for PCa, 111 are common in Ugandan men (MAF>0.1%) and ~70% had ORs in UGPCS that were directionally consistent with previous studies, which suggests that most of the known PCa susceptibility variants are likely to be markers of PCa risk in East African men.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Just over half (56.7%) of the effects sizes observed in UGPCS were smaller than those observed in European ancestry populations (or had opposite directions), and only 14 risk alleles achieved nominal statistical significance.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This observation is likely due to many factors, including variability of effect estimation due to small sample size, true differences in the effect of these susceptible variants across ethnic groups and population differences in LD between the index risk SNPs and causal alleles.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Larger studies in men of African ancestry will be required to disentangle these possibilities
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The overwhelming importance of genetic variation at 8q24 in contributing to PCa risk was confirmed in UGPCS, with five independent risk alleles observed in this region.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The polygenic risk score analysis further demonstrated the substantial contribution of 8q24 to PCa susceptibility, with the mean risk score increasing by ~50% with the inclusion of the five independent risk SNPs in the 8q24 region (9.70) to the PRS of the 92 non-8q24 known risk alleles (6.49).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The change in the AUC of 0.06 when adding 5 8q24 alleles suggests variation in this region is important for risk classification, although overfitting likely exists in this study and external validation is needed
0	indolent disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	A predictive PRS for PCa may be effective for identifying high-risk populations who are most likely to benefit from biopsy and subsequent treatment, and in reducing the over-diagnosis of indolent disease.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Studies among men of European descent (using 100 risk SNPs) indicate that men in the 90-99% of the PRS have a ~3-fold increase in PCa risk compared to the population average (25th-75th percentile of the PRS distribution).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In our study, using a comparable set of 97 risk SNPs, Ugandan men in the 90-99% of the PRS demonstrated an increased PCa risk of 4.55-fold (95%CI: 2.48,8.36) compared with the average risk.
0	NA	NA	rs72725854	DISCUSS	This elevated risk might be attributed to African-specific risk alleles included in our PRS, especially rs72725854, which has a greater effect size and is limited to Ugandan men, or, perhaps variability in effect estimation due to the limited sample size of our study.
0	APC	NA	NA	DISCUSS	To address this, we also constructed the PRS using per-allele log odds ratios obtained from the large AAPC meta-analysis (>10 000 cases) in men of African Ancestry as weights, which includes some of the UGPCS samples.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Here, we found that men in the 90-99% risk stratum had a relative risk of 4.79 (95%CI: 2.64, 8.71), which is still larger than that reported in previous studies among Whites, and is similar to that observed using Uganda-specific weights (ie, ORs) suggesting that the effects and/or frequencies of PCa risk alleles may be greater in men of African ancestry.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, the risk may be higher in our study because we removed controls with PSA levels >=4 ng/m, which is a criterion that is not applied consistently in other studies.
0	aggressive disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We found no evidence of heterogeneity in the PRS by disease aggressiveness which is consistent with other studies.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Other studies have provided evidence of heterogeneity in PRS effects by PCa family history, but unfortunately, family history was not available in our study, so we were not able to assess this hypothesis here
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	A major limitation in this study is the small sample size, with statistical power for testing of known risk loci and for risk allele discovery being underpowered.
0	NA	MAF	NA	DISCUSS	For known risk alleles with MAF of 20%, the power to detect ORs of 1.25 at a nominal significant level (P < 0.05) was only 55%.
0	NA	MAF	NA	DISCUSS	In the exploratory genome-wide analyses, for alleles with MAF of 20%, there was only a priori adequate power (80%) to detect alleles with large effects (ORs >1.90) at genome-wide significance (P <5x 10-8)
0	NA	NA	rs72725854	DISCUSS	The most genome-wide significant association was noted with rs72725854.
0	NA	NA	rs72725854	DISCUSS	The risk variant rs72725854 is tri-allelic, with the risk allele T only reported in African ancestry populations, and is correlated with other published African ancestry-specific 8q24 risk alleles rs114798100 (r2 = 0.54) and rs111906932 (r2 = 0.39).
0	APC	PCAT1	NA	DISCUSS	This variant is located in an intergenic region near a long non-coding RNA, PCAT1 (Prostate Cancer Associated Transcript 1), and was previously discovered in the AAPC GWAS which included the majority of UGPCS subjects.
0	APC	NA	NA	DISCUSS	While the RAF of this variant is similar across African ancestry populations (5-11% in AFR populations in 1KGP) the odds ratio was slightly higher in Ugandan men (OR = 3.37; 95%CI, 2.36-4.82) compared to that reported in AAPC, which included mainly African Americans (OR = 2.13; 95%CI, 1.97-2.32)
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In summary, we found that the known PCa risk variants can effectively stratify PCa risk in Ugandan men, with 10% of men having a >4-fold increase in risk.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	These results also emphasize the importance of germline variation at the 8q24 risk region in the etiology of PCa in Ugandan men.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Larger studies in African populations will be required to identify additional PCa risk alleles that aid in risk stratification and that contribute to the higher PCa incidence in this population
