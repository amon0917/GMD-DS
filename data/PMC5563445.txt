0	Type 2 diabetes	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	The prevalence of Type II Diabetes (T2D) has been increasing and has become a disease of significant public health burden in Jordan.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	None of the previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have specifically investigated the Middle East populations.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	The Circassian and Chechen communities in Jordan represent unique populations that are genetically distinct from the Arab population and other populations in the Caucasus.
0	obese	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Prevalence of T2D is very high in both the Circassian and Chechen communities in Jordan despite low obesity prevalence.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	We conducted GWAS on T2D in these two populations and further performed meta-analysis of the results.
0	NA	NA	rs6134031	ABSTRACT	We identified a novel T2D locus at chr20p12.2 at genome-wide significance (rs6134031, P = 1.12 x 10-8) and we replicated the results in the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) dataset.
0	NA	MLXIP	rs4758690	ABSTRACT	Another locus at chr12q24.31 is associated with T2D at suggestive significance level (top SNP rs4758690, P = 4.20 x 10-5) and it is a robust eQTL for the gene, MLXIP (P = 1.10 x 10-14), and is significantly associated with methylation level in MLXIP, the functions of which involves cellular glucose response.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Therefore, in this first GWAS of T2D in Jordan subpopulations, we identified novel and unique susceptibility loci which may help inform the genetic underpinnings of T2D in other populations
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	Diabetes is among the most common non-communicable diseases globally.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	It has been estimated that there are currently about 194 million people at the age of 20 to 79 with diabetes worldwide and that this number will further increase to 333 million by 2025.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	Diabetes is the fifth main cause of death in Jordan, afflicting 16 percent of Jordanian adult citizens; another 23.8 percent of adults in Jordan are also on the brink of becoming diabetics according to a study from 2007 by the Heart and Capillary Disease Prevention directorate (HCDP) of the Ministry of Health in Jordan; and the rate of diabetes prevalence in Jordan is 30.5 percent among both children and adults.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	Thus, diabetes presents a significant public health burden to the Jordan community.
0	Type 2 diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	Type II Diabetes (T2D) is the major type of diabetes, which accounts for 95% percent of all diabetes cases worldwide
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Despite extensive research efforts for more than a decade and some notable successes, much of the genetic basis of common human diseases remains unresolved.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The genome-wide association study (GWAS) has been a powerful approach for identifying novel susceptibility loci for complex diseases, such as T2D.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	To date, more than 80 T2D susceptibility loci have been uncovered by GWAS.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	However, the heritability attributed to these loci remains as low as just 10%.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In addition, these studies have mostly focused on populations of European ancestry and East Asians, with a few studies on South Asians and Mexicans.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The genetic determinants of T2D in Middle East populations have not been extensively studied by GWAS and limited evidence suggested that at least some of the reported T2D loci showed differential associations in different populations in the Middle East.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	It has also been reported that the presentation of T2D is different between Middle East immigrants and European patients, implying some different genetic basis between populations.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Given the prevalence of the disease in the region, more research is warranted to understand the genetic basis of T2D specific to given Middle Eastern populations
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The Circassians and the Chechens are two ethnic populations of ancient descent in Jordan, both of which are the largest indigenous nationalities of the North Caucasus.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	These two populations are descendants of a single ancient origin with later divisions along linguistic and geographic borders.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	After immigrating to Jordan 140 years ago, Circassians and Chechens in Jordan are endogamous and have managed to keep their separate sense of identity and ethnicity during the last one hundred years in Jordan.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Previous analysis of classical genetic markers such as blood groups and serum proteins have also shown statistical significant genetic diversity in the Caucasus, which has been further confirmed by mitochondrial DNA and Y chromosome analysis.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	While a T2D GWAS has been conducted in the Lebanese population, the Lebanese are Arab in origin; Circassians and Chechans are a separate, non-Arab ethnic group.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	These are clearly different populations, with different ancestries.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The Circassian and Chechen communities may provide us an opportunity to study a genetically unique population and compare genetic basis for complex human diseases between different populations
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	T2D has become an alarming public health issue in Jordan.
0	Neurological and Communication Disorders	NA	NA	INTRO	Epidemiology studies showed that the prevalence of impaired fasting glycemia is 18.5% and 14.6% and prevalence of diabetes is 9.6% and 10.1% for Circassians and Chechens, respectively.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In view of the very high incidence of T2D in Jordan and the genetic distinctness of Circassian and Chechan populations, we performed a GWAS to search for genetic factors contributing to T2D in these two populations and compared the results with European population

0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Thus the genotype of these 2 SNPs are important for inter-related human traits, suggesting these traits share common molecular underpinnings
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our study has started to reveal the similarities and differences of the genetic basis of T2D between Jordan subpopulations and other ethnicities.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Despite the small sample size, we were able to replicate almost half of the loci that were reported to be associated with T2D in genetic and genomic studies in other populations.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The replication of these associations suggests some common genetic basis underlying the development of T2D among different ethnicities.
0	NA	CDKAL1	rs7756992	DISCUSS	For complex traits and diseases, there are many GWAS loci which could not be replicated across different ethnicities, such as the SNP rs7756992 in the CDKAL1 gene which strongly associates with T2D in subjects of European ancestry, but displayed no association in a population of West Africa.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Among the 37 SNPs associated with T2D in European or Asian populations, only two were replicated in a Qatari population.
0	NA	NA	rs6134031	DISCUSS	In the Jordan subpopulations examined, we observed a significant association of rs6134031 and T2D, with a very large effect size.
0	NA	NA	rs6134031	DISCUSS	In the WTCCC, including only subjects of European ancestry, the LD structure for this region is different and the association of rs6134031 with T2D is less strong.
0	NA	NA	rs4758690	DISCUSS	The association at SNP rs4758690 is nominally significant in both Jordan subpopulations, however it is not significant in WTCCC subjects of European ancestry.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The identification of these two loci suggested unique genetic determinants for T2D in the Jordan subpopulations.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The separate GWAS performed in Chechen and Circassian subpopulations also suggest distinct genetic factors for T2D in each of these two ethnicities.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	As reviewed by, such ethnic population differences may arise from variations in disease allele frequency, effect direction, effect size, distinct LD patterns, and trait/disease phenotype prevalence.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Therefore, it is important to carry out genetic studies in different ethnic groups
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	A major limitation of our study is the small size, which reduces the statistical power to detect a true effect of the genetic variants.
0	inflation of type I error	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The small sample size may lead to p-values of true associations failing to reach stringent significance thresholds, like the genome-wide significance threshold of 5 x 10-8, resulting in false negatives (type II error).
1	NA	JAG1	NA	DISCUSS	Therefore, we also considered other biological evidence when interpreting our results and we were encouraged by the replication of the JAG1 locus and the strong eQTL signal observed for MLXIP, due to their strong biological relevance to T2D.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	As reported and discussed by other studies, true association may not always reach the conventionally corrected conservative threshold of 5 x 10-8 for declaring a genome-wide significance.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In our case, future studies with larger sample sizes of Jordan populations are needed to replicate the findings from our study and to further identify other genetic loci
0	NA	NA	NA	CONCL	Taken together, our results from the first GWAS of T2D conducted in two subpopulations in Jordan have identified novel genetic factors underlying T2D; we additionally demonstrate there is common genetic basis among the different ethnicities as well as certain unique genetic factors that underlie T2D in the Jordan subpopulations.
0	NA	NA	NA	CONCL	Identification of these novel genetic risk factors will offer the potential to gain further insight into the development of T2D and may help with the development of novel treatments precisely for the Jordan populations, which will reduce disease burden and promote health
