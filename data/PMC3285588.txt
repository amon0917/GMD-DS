0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies diagnosed among women worldwide, including those living in East Asian countries.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Genetic factors play an important role in the etiology of both sporadic and familial breast cancer.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	In the past two decades, more than 1,000 reports have been published addressing the association between variants in candidate genes and breast cancer risk.
0	cancers	NA	NA	INTRO	However, only a few genetic risk factors have been confirmed for this common malignancy.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified approximately 20 common genetic susceptibility loci for breast cancer.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	However, these newly-identified genetic factors, along with known high-penetrance breast cancer susceptibility genes explain less than 30% of the heritability for this cancer.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Furthermore, most GWAS were conducted among women of European ancestry, and many of the variants discovered in European-ancestry populations showed only a weak or no association with breast cancer in other ethnic groups.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	For example, only 8 of 12 breast cancer risk SNPs identified in women of European ancestry were directly replicated in Chinese population.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Therefore, GWAS conducted in non-European women are needed to fully uncover the genetic basis for breast cancer susceptibility.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Herein, we report results from a large GWAS of breast cancer conducted in East Asian women

0	NA	SUMO4	NA	DISCUSS	Other genes in the region identified in the study included SUMO4, LATS1, PPIL4, and UST.
0	prostate carcinogenesis	NA	rs9485372	DISCUSS	However, given the proximity of the TAB2 gene with rs9485372 and the important role of this gene in breast carcinogenesis, it is possible that the association between rs9485372 and breast cancer risk may be mediated through the TAB2 gene.
1	NA	ER	rs9485372	DISCUSS	It is also possible that the association may be mediated through regulating the ESR1 gene, located approximately 2.5 Mb from rs9485372.

1	breast cancer	ER	rs9383951	DISCUSS	Although the association with rs9383951 did not reach the conventional genome-wide significance, the fact that this SNP is located in the ESR1 gene strongly suggests a true association of this SNP with breast cancer risk

0	breast cancer	NA	NA	METHODS	During the course of Stage III genotyping, genome-wide association scan data from 2,359 cases and 2,052 controls were obtained from the Seoul Breast Cancer GWAS (Stage IIb).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis of Stage IIa and IIb data.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Of the 5,297 SNPs which were not selected initially for Stage III replication based on Stage IIa data alone, data were available for 4,913 SNPs in Stage IIb.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Meta-analyses of these 4,913 SNPs from Stage IIa and IIb yielded 26 additional SNPs that showed an association at P<=0.05 and in the same direction among stages I, IIa, and IIb.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	These 26 SNPs were then added to the list of SNPs to be genotyped in Stage III
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	SNP selection for Stage IV replication: Based on the results of the first three stages, 22 top SNPs were selected for Stage IV evaluation and genotyped in up to 17,423 additional subjects (7,489 cases and 9,934 controls) (Table 1 and Text S1)
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Case-control differences in selected demographic characteristics and major risk factors were evaluated using t-tests (for continuous variables) and Chi-square tests (for categorical variables).
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	METHODS	Associations between SNPs and breast cancer risk were assessed using odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) derived from logistic regression models.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	ORs were estimated for heterozygote and homozygote for the variant allele compared with homozygotes for the common allele.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	ORs were also estimated for the variant allele based on a log-additive model and adjusted for age, and study site, when appropriate.
1	NA	ER	NA	METHODS	Stratified analyses by ethnicity, menopausal status, and estrogen receptor (ER) status were carried out.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	PLINK version 1.06 was used to analyze genome-wide data obtained in Stage I and the replication data in Stage IIa.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Results from Stage IIb were also obtained from PLINK version 1.06.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Meta-analyses of Stage IIa and Stage IIb were performed using a weighted z-statistics method, where weights were proportional to the square root of the number of individuals in each sample and standardized such that the weights added up to one.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The z-statistic summarizes the magnitude and direction of the effect relative to the reference allele.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	An overall z-statistic and p value were then calculated from the weighted average of the individual statistics.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Calculations were implemented in the METAL package (http://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/Metal).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Individual data were obtained from each study for Stage IV SNPs for a pooled analysis, which were conducted using SAS, version 9.2, with the use of two-tailed tests
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We first investigated the population structure by estimating inflation factor lambda using all 690,947 SNPs SNPs that passed the QC.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The inflation factor lambda was estimated to be 1.042, suggesting that any population substructure, if present, should not have any appreciable effect on the results.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Among the final 690,947 SNPs obtained in Stage I after QC, we generated a list of 196,471 SNPs with pairwise LD<0.2 by using plink (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Then, principal components were estimated based on these 196,471 SNPs using EIGENSTRAT.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We then drew a plot for all Stage I and HapMap II subjects based on the first two principal components (Figure 4).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	All study participants in Stage I were clustered very closely with HapMap Asians.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	METHODS	The first 5 or 10 principal components were adjusted in the logistic regression analyses for evaluating associations of SNPs and breast cancer risk
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	FIG	A: all individuals from Stage I and HapMap; B: breast cancer cases and controls from Stage I
0	breast cancer	NA	rs9383951	METHODS	To evaluate the combined effect of SNPs located in chromosome 6q25.1 on breast cancer risk, we created a genetic risk score (GRS) by summing the number (0-2) of risk alleles that each woman carried for each of the three SNPs, including rs9383951, rs9485372, rs2046210.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The GRS was constructed among those who had complete data for all three SNPs.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We also did imputation using MACH (http://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/MACH/index.html) with HapMap II Asian data as reference.
1	NA	ER	NA	METHODS	LD structure was estimated from the flanking 100 kb of these three SNPs and the ESR1 gene using data from HapMap II Asians (Figure S1).
1	breast cancer	ER	rs9485372	METHODS	All SNPs in the LD blocks including rs9485372, rs2046210 and rs9383951 and SNPs inside the ESR1 gene were analyzed in relation to breast cancer risk with age, rs9485372, rs9383951 and rs2046210 adjusted
