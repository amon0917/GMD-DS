0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	Diabetes is a huge and growing problem.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	The worldwide prevalence of diabetes in those aged 20-79 years was estimated to be 8.3% in 2011, including approximately 12.4% of Koreans aged >= 30 years.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	It has been estimated that the number of diabetic patients worldwide will reach 439 million adults by 2030, primarily due to population growth, lifestyle, and demographic changes
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Iron is a vital nutrient for humans and is a cofactor for various metabolic functions.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	However, excessive iron levels helps produce and amplify free radicals, which can lead to tissue damage.
0	pancreatic	NA	NA	INTRO	In particular, because of inefficient hydrogen peroxide-inactivating enzymes, pancreatic beta cells are susceptible to oxidative stress.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	With the exception of direct tissue damage, elevated oxidative stress may directly lead to increased blood glucose levels.
0	Type 2 diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	Additionally, increased heme iron intake is significantly associated with a greater risk of Type 2 diabetes (T2D).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	There is a positive relationship between an increased risk of T2D and serum ferritin, an indicator of total body iron stores.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Additionally, higher hemoglobin level is also associated with a high risk of T2D in women
0	NA	Hepcidin	NA	INTRO	Hepcidin, a peptide hormone synthesized by hepatocytes, is a key modulator of dietary iron absorption and iron release from macrophages, and increasing body iron stores induce hepcidin synthesis.
0	infection	Hepcidin	NA	INTRO	Production of hepcidin is also induced by infection and inflammation, which result in decreased iron absorption and iron release from macrophages.
0	anaemia	Hepcidin	NA	INTRO	Conversely, anemia leads to a decrease in hepcidin production, thereby eliminating the inhibitory effect on intestinal iron absorption and release from macrophages.
0	anaemia	NA	NA	INTRO	Thus, inflammatory status and anemia need to be considered in epidemiologic studies regarding iron status
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Environmental, genetic factors, and their interactions contribute to the development of T2D.

0	hereditary hemochromatosis	HFE	NA	INTRO	Previously, one study suggested a potential interaction between hemochromatosis (HFE), a major regulator of iron homeostasis, and heme iron intake.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	However, another study did not find any new interactions between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the heme iron metabolic pathway and heme iron intake.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Currently, it is unclear whether iron levels interact with SNPs on the risk of T2D
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	To the best of our knowledge, there have been no studies investigating the interaction effects between iron intake and gene polymorphisms in the Asian population.

1	NA	KCNQ1	rs2237892	DISCUSS	Indeed, the major allele (C) of rs2237892 in KCNQ1, which was in high linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs163177 (D' = 1.00), was significantly associated an increased risk of T2D.
0	NA	NA	rs2237892	DISCUSS	In a meta-analysis, the summary per-allele odds ratio of the C variant of rs2237892 for T2D was 1.32 (95% CI: 1.26-1.38).
1	pancreatic	KCNQ1	NA	DISCUSS	This could be explained by the fact that KCNQ1 encodes the pore-forming subunit of a voltage-gated K+ channel (KvLQT1) and is also expressed in pancreatic islets; thus, variants of KCNQ1 may be in connection with insulin section.
1	NA	KCNQ1	NA	DISCUSS	On the contrary, KCNQ1 mutation may reduce gastric acid secretion, which could cause decreased absorption of ferric iron and thereby reduce the risk of T2D.
1	NA	KCNQ1	NA	DISCUSS	Although KCNQ1 may be related to iron metabolism, it is likely that its beneficial influence on T2D is weaker than its harmful effects
0	NA	CDKAL1	NA	DISCUSS	In this study, we identified that there was cross-sectional association between variants near CDKAL1 and T2D, but the variants were not associated with incidence of T2D.
1	NA	CDKAL1	rs7754840	DISCUSS	A GWAS study in a Chinese Han Population has reported that the four CDKAL1 SNPs (rs7754840, rs10946398, rs7756992, and rs9465871) were cross-sectionally associated with T2D (range of odds ratio: 1.38-1.49; P < 1.9 x 10-5)
0	NA	CDKAL1	NA	DISCUSS	The lack of an association between CDKAL1 and the incidence of T2D is not in line with previous cross-sectional observations, but does agree with a prospective study in the U.S..
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The definite function of this gene is not well known.
0	insulin deficiency	CDKAL1	NA	DISCUSS	However, Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have reported that variants of CDKAL1 was significantly associated with reduced insulin secretion.
0	NA	CDKAL1	NA	DISCUSS	Therefore, the function of CDKAL1 may be related to beta-cell function.
0	NA	CDKAL1	NA	DISCUSS	We could not assert why CDKAL1 was not detected as a SNP affecting T2D incidence in this longitudinal analysis.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, because the present study population was composed of subjects aged 40-69 years in the baseline survey and only non-diabetic subjects were included in the prospective analyses, the influence of genes on the incidence of T2D may be diminished compared to a population including diabetics diagnosed at a younger age.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The strengths of the environmental (dietary) and genetic effects may change over the course of a lifetime; genetic effects may decrease with age as environmental effects exert more influence.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This finding suggests that SNPs previously found in case-control analyses need to be confirmed in a longitudinal study design and that our results need to be pursued in future large-scale cohort studies
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our study has some limitations.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	First, serum ferritin is the most widely used biomarker of body iron status, but it was not examined in the present study.
0	NA	Hepcidin	NA	DISCUSS	Serum ferritin may be a better indicator of body iron status than iron intake and hemoglobin, but hemoglobin levels are related to serum ferritin and hepcidin.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Because 1-year FFQ depends upon the long-term memory of participants, dietary intake accuracy may be lower.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In addition, we could not integrate FFQs of the first and third surveys because different questionnaires were used; therefore, we could not calculate average iron intake.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Another limitation was that we did not have information on the form of iron (heme/non-heme iron), which is important in determining the bioavailability of iron.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Regardless of these limitations, the strength of the present study was a population-based prospective cohort study with genome data and repeated measures of hemoglobin.
1	NA	JMJD1C	NA	DISCUSS	In addition, the present study provided the first longitudinal evidence on the interaction effect between a SNP of JMJD1C with iron intake and hemoglobin level
1	NA	JMJD1C	NA	DISCUSS	In conclusion, SNPs of JMJD1C at 10q21.2 and KCNQ1 at 11p15.5 were prospectively associated with the risk of T2D.
0	NA	CDKAL1	NA	DISCUSS	Additionally, CDKAL1 may not be associated with T2D onset over the age of 40.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Results from our study confirm that iron intake and hemoglobin levels are associated with a higher risk of T2D.
1	Inflammation Laboratory's JDRF	JMJD1C	NA	DISCUSS	In addition, we found that for women, a SNP of JMJD1C was interacted with average hemoglobin level on the risk of T2D among participants with normal inflammation and without anemia.
1	NA	JMJD1C	NA	DISCUSS	However, further study on the function of JMJD1C is necessary to confirm these associations for prevention and/or treatment of T2D
