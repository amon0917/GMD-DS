0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Our finding points toward new AD-related pathways and provides clues toward novel medical targets for the cure of AD
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, irreversible neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the development of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, the loss of connections between neurons, and nerve cell death.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	AD is highly heritable and genetically heterogeneous with 58%-79% of risk attributed to genetic factors.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Although genome-wide association studies have strongly improved our knowledge of AD genetics, genetic risk factors explain no more than 30% of heritability.
0	Alzheimer's disease	age	NA	INTRO	In this contribution, we focus on late-onset AD, the most common form of the disease with onset age >65 years.
0	Alzheimer's disease	apolipoprotein E	NA	INTRO	The most established genetic factor for AD, apolipoprotein E gene ([APOE] gene, 19q13), exhibits allelic heterogeneity:APOE's epsilon4 allele is a risk enhancer, whereas the epsilon2 allele is protective
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	AD presents notable sexual dimorphism.
0	glucose metabolism alterations	NA	NA	INTRO	Records exist of sex differences in the brain, such as in brain anatomy, age-related declines in brain volume and brain glucose metabolism, and sex hormones influencing AD progression.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Risk associated with the APOE-epsilon4 allele is stronger in females than in males, and loss of chromosome Y have been associated with increased AD risk in males.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	These data support complex interplay between sex and genetic background regarding AD predisposition
0	dependency	NA	NA	INTRO	Gene regulatory and biochemical networks create dependencies among genes that are realized as gene-gene interactions (epistasis).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Although epistasis has been well studied in model organisms using biological experiments, hypothesis-free discovery of biological epistasis via statistical methods remains challenging in humans.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	This is in part due to the conceptual discrepancy between statistical and biological epistasis, the utility of oversimplified population-level models to capture complex individual phenomena, insufficient power, and the gross multiple testing burden inherent in genome-wide epistasis screening.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Therefore, most evidence for epistasis in AD is hypothesis-driven, using prior biological or statistical knowledge.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	The same holds for sex-specific searches for coinvolvement of multiple genetic loci in AD
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Gusareva et al.
0	Alzheimer's disease	KHDRBS2	rs6455128	INTRO	published the first replicable interaction associated with AD using a genome-wide exhaustive screening approach that combines strengths over different analytic approaches, identified a statistical interaction between KHDRBS2 (rs6455128) and CRYL1 (rs7989332), and exhibited downstream functional consequences.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Here, we used the same European AD Initiative Investigators (EADI1) consortium cohort (2259/6017 AD cases/controls) and an adapted hypothesis-free genome-wide exhaustive epistasis screening protocol to identify sex-specific interactions with AD.
0	NA	KIBRA	NA	INTRO	We identified AD-associated male-specific statistical interaction between variants of the genes WWC1 (WW and C2 domain containing 1 or kidney and brain expressed protein, aka KIBRA; locus 15q22.2) and TLN2 (talin 2, locus 15q22.2).

0	NA	KIBRA	NA	RESULTS	Coexpression of kibra with Tau resulted in lethality and the only escapers that we obtained had smaller eyes.
0	NA	KIBRA	NA	RESULTS	For kibra knockdown and kibra overexpression, the effect may be additive as in both conditions without Tau expression, fly eyes are respectively bigger and smaller (Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	2A and B).
0	haploinsufficiency	KIBRA	NA	RESULTS	For kibra haploinsufficiencies, only 1 of 4 independent null mutations restored the eye size precluding us to firmly conclude that kibra interacts with Tau in Drosophila eye.
0	haploinsufficiency	NA	NA	RESULTS	The result in the rhea1/+ haploinsufficient background (Fig.

0	Alzheimer's disease	KIBRA	NA	RESULTS	Immunohistochemistry of the brain of a male autopsied AD patient indicated strong expression of WWC1 in the soma of neuronal cells throughout the temporal lobe of the cerebral cortex (Fig.

0	Alzheimer's disease	KIBRA	NA	DISCUSS	This is the first contribution showing (sex-specific) biological epistasis in AD between genes identified via exhaustive genomic epistasis analysis: WWC1 (WW and C2 domain containing 1 or kidney and brain expressed protein, aka KIBRA) and TLN2 (talin 2).
0	NA	KIBRA	NA	DISCUSS	WWC1 is expressed in brain regions responsible for learning and memory (hippocampus and cortex) and is involved in maintaining of synaptic plasticity.
0	NA	TLN2	NA	DISCUSS	TLN2 expression is restricted to the heart, skeletal muscle, and brain (synapses and focal adhesions).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	It plays an important role in the assembly of actin filaments (particularly affecting actin dynamics and clathrin-mediated endocytosis at neuronal synapses) and in spreading and migration of various cell types.
0	Alzheimer's disease	KIBRA	NA	DISCUSS	WWC1 has already been associated with memory-related disorders including AD, whereas TLN2 has not.
0	toxicity	TLN2	NA	DISCUSS	However, in our study, rhea (ortholog of TLN2 in Drosophila) modulated Tau toxicity in Drosophila and thus may be involved in AD pathology.
0	toxicity	tau	NA	DISCUSS	Interestingly, recent studies identified several other components of the cell adhesion pathway as modifiers of Tau toxicity in Drosophila.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Studying the mechanisms of the identified epistatic interaction, we performed comprehensive functional biological experiments.
0	Alzheimer's disease	WWC1	NA	DISCUSS	WWC1 and TLN2 were coexpressed in the temporal cortex brain tissue (responsible for learning and memory) of AD subjects, colocalized in both brain tissue cells, in neuroblastoma N2a and HeLa cell lines, and coimmunoprecipitated both in brain tissue and HEK293 cells.
0	NA	KIBRA	NA	DISCUSS	The physical interaction between WWC1 and TLN2 was also supported by in silico experiments where the binding affinity between the 2 proteins was pretty strong with favorable conditions for forming a stable protein complex
0	dementia symptoms	KIBRA	NA	DISCUSS	We may speculate on the involvement of WWC1 and TLN2 in common signaling pathways connected to signal transduction via synapses that are impaired when dementia symptoms and AD progress.
0	Alzheimer's disease	KIBRA	NA	DISCUSS	Because overexpression of WWC1 was previously associated with AD, we speculate that impairment expression of WWC1 and/or TLN2 proteins may destabilize actin filaments.
0	Alzheimer's disease	KIBRA	NA	DISCUSS	Additional work is required to further describe a functional interplay between WWC1 and TLN2 and to explain why we observed the interaction at an individual level for both sexes, whereas we could detect association with AD only in males at a population level (despite of the theoretical power loss for epistasis detection in a sample stratum of males).
0	NA	KIBRA	NA	DISCUSS	A few explanations are possible and should be investigated in detail: the influence of sex hormones on the epistasis manifestation, the involvement of a third interacting component (i.e., an interacting gene) linked to the sex chromosomes, other types of sex-specific variant(s) in WWC1 and TLN2, among others.
0	NA	KIBRA	NA	DISCUSS	Regardless, our findings provide impetus for an in-depth search of AD-related mutation(s) in WWC1 and TLN2 genes to better explore and grasp biological mechanisms underlying the identified sex-specific epistasis signals.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Targeted next-generation sequencing of the interacting genes may facilitate the identification of new functional mutations (either common or rare) that play a role in protein structure, stability, solubility, folding, and affinity of interaction with ligand(s), to name a few
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	There is still a big divide between statistical epistasis and biological epistasis.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The ambition in detecting statistical epistasis is to close this gap by improved analysis protocols and to formulate guidelines toward the interpretation of statistical findings in the context of epistasis.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The field has evolved a lot over the last decade, in this sense.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This does not change the fact that indeed, the power of a genome-wide epistasis screening (GWAI analysis) using a single study is much smaller than the power of a corresponding main effects GWA analysis using the same data.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our experience with large-scale epistasis studies is consistent with this, usually only giving rise to 1 or 2 reliable statistical findings (i.e., findings for which we can rule out numerical instability issues or strong main effects overtaking the joint effects of the loci involved).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Regardless, results dating back from already suggested that biological inference from statistical models is not a utopia
