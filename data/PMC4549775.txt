0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The disease aggregates in families, and has an important inherited component.
0	NA	BRCA1	NA	INTRO	This inherited component is driven by a combination of rare variants, notably in BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, ATM and CHEK2 conferring a moderate or high lifetime risk of the disease, together with common variants at more than 70 loci, identified through GWAS and large scale replication studies.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Taken together, these loci explain approximately one-third of the excess familial risk of breast cancer
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	The majority of susceptibility SNPs has been identified through the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC), a collaboration involving more than 50 case-control studies.
0	Colon and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	We recently reported the results of a large-scale genotyping experiment within BCAC, which utilised a custom array (iCOGS) designed to study variants of interest for breast, ovarian and prostate cancers.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	iCOGS comprised more than 200,000 variants, of which 29,807 had been selected from combined analysis of nine breast cancer GWAS involving 10,052 breast cancer cases and 12,575 controls of European ancestry.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	In total, 45,290 breast cancer cases and 41,880 controls of European ancestry from 41 studies were genotyped with iCOGS, leading to the discovery of 41 novel susceptibility loci.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	A parallel analysis identified four loci specific to oestrogen receptor (ER)-negative disease.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	However, additional susceptibility loci may have been missed because they were not selected from the original GWAS, or not included on the array
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Genotype imputation is a powerful approach to infer missing genotypes using the genetic correlations defined in a densely genotyped reference panel, thus providing the opportunity to identify novel susceptibility variants even if not directly genotyped.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	In this analysis we aimed to identify additional breast cancer susceptibility loci by utilising data from all 200k variants on the iCOGS array, and used imputation to estimate genotypes for more than 11M SNPs.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We applied the same approach to data from 11 GWAS.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	After quality control (QC) exclusions, the dataset comprised 15,748 breast cancer cases and 18,084 controls from GWAS, and 46,785 cases and 42,892 controls from 41 studies genotyped with iCOGS (see Online Methods and Supplementary Tables 1a-1e).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	All subjects were women of European ancestry
0	NA	MAF	NA	INTRO	We imputed genotypes using the 1000 Genomes Project March 2012 release as the reference dataset (see Online Methods) The main analyses were based on ~11.6M SNPs that were imputed with imputation r2 >0.3 and had MAF>0.005 in at least one of the datasets
0	NA	MAF	NA	INTRO	Of common SNPs (MAF>0.05), 88% were imputed from the iCOGS array with r2>0.5; this compared to 99% of variants for the largest GWAS (UK2), which was genotyped using a 670k SNP array (Figure 1a and 1b, Supplementary Table 2).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Thirty-seven per cent of common SNPs were imputed on the iCOGS with r2>0.9, compared with 85% for UK2.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Thus, despite being designed as a follow-up of GWAS for different diseases rather than a genome-wide array, the majority of common variants could be imputed using the iCOGS, but the overall imputation quality was, poorer that from a standard GWAS array.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Imputation quality decreased with decreasing allele frequency (Figure 1c and 1d, Supplementary Table 2)
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Log odds ratio estimates and standard errors were calculated for each dataset using logistic regression, adjusting for principal components where it was found to reduce substantially the inflation factor.
0	NA	MAF	NA	INTRO	We then combined the results from each dataset for variants with MAF >0.5% using a fixed effects meta-analysis.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	More than 7,000 variants with a combined P<5x10-8 for association were identified, the large majority of which was in regions previously shown to be associated with breast cancer susceptibility.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Of the 79 previously published breast cancer susceptibility loci identified in women of European ancestry, all but eight show evidence of association at P<5x10-8 for overall, ER-positive or ER-negative disease risk (Supplementary Tables 3a, 3b and 3c).
0	NA	NA	rs1550623	INTRO	For four of the eight variants, (rs1550623 on 2q31, rs11571833 on 13q13.1, rs12422552 on 12p13.1 and rs11242674 on 6p25.3), slightly weaker evidence of association was observed.
0	NA	TERT	rs7726159	INTRO	One reported variant, rs7726159 did not reach P<5x10-8 in this (P=0.0017) or the previous analysis - it was identified through fine-mapping of the TERT region on 5p15.33.
0	NA	AKAP9	rs6964587	INTRO	One other variant in AKAP9, rs6964587 reported previously did not reach P<5x10-8 but an alternative correlated with it did (P=3.67x10-8 for chr7:91681597:D; r2 between the two markers = 0.98).
0	NA	CASP8	rs2380205	INTRO	The two remaining variants (rs2380205 on 10p15 and rs1045485 at CASP8) were reported in earlier analysis but did not even reach P<0.0001, suggesting that they may have been false positive reports.
0	NA	CASP8	rs1830298	INTRO	An alternative variant at CASP8, rs1830298 (r2=0.06, D'=1 with rs1045485 in 1000G CEU) did reach P<5x10-8 in this dataset
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	To assess evidence for additional susceptibility loci, we removed all SNPs within 500kb of susceptibility variants identified previously in women of European ancestry, leaving 314 variants from 27 regions associated with breast cancer at P<5x10-8 (Supplementary Figures 1 and 2).
0	NA	NA	rs62237573	INTRO	The strongest associations were observed in a 610kb (b37 28,314,612- 28,928,858) interval on chromosome 22 (smallest P=8.2x10-22, for rs62237573).
0	breast cancer	CHEK2	1100delC	INTRO	This interval lies approximately 100kb centromeric to CHEK2, and further analysis revealed that the associated SNPs were correlated with the CHEK2 founder variant 1100delC (strongest correlation r2=0.39 for SNP rs62235635), CHEK2 1100delC is known to be associated with breast cancer through candidate gene analysis, but has not previously generated an association in GWAS .
0	NA	CHEK2	1100delC	INTRO	We performed an analysis adjusting for CHEK2 1100delC using data on ~40,000 samples that had been genotyped for this variant.
0	NA	CHEK2	rs140914118	INTRO	The strongest associated variant in this subset was rs140914118; after adjustment for 1100delC the statistical significance diminished markedly (P=3.1x10-9 to P=0.78; Supplementary Figures 3a and 3b), suggesting that this signal is driven by CHEK2 1100delC
0	NA	DNAJC1	NA	INTRO	Variants in four regions (DNAJC1, 5p12, PTHLH and MKL1) lay within 2Mb of a previously published susceptibility-associated SNP.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In each case, these associations became weaker (no longer P<5x10-8) after adjustment for the previously associated SNP(s) in the region (data not shown).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	For four other regions, the significant variants were identified in just one GWAS, and failed imputation (r2<0.3) in the remaining datasets, including iCOGS; we did not consider these variants further
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	To confirm the results for the remaining 18 regions, we performed re-imputation in the iCOGS dataset without phasing (See Online Methods).
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Fifteen loci remained associated with breast cancer at P<5x10-8 (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 4).
0	breast cancer	NA	rs11205277	INTRO	For three of the loci, the most significant SNP, or a highly correlated SNP, had been directly genotyped on iCOGS (Supplementary Table 5); one, rs11205277, had been included on the array because it is associated with adult height, while the other two were selected based on evidence from the combined breast cancer GWAS but failed to reach genome-wide significance in the earlier analyses.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We attempted to genotype the 12 remaining variants on a subset of ~4K samples to confirm the quality of the imputation (10 variants could be directly genotyped, for one region an alternative correlated variant was selected (Supplementary Table 5).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	For the 11 variants that could be assessed, the r2 between the observed and imputed genotypes were close to the r2 estimated in the imputation.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Furthermore, the estimated effect sizes in the subset of individuals that we genotyped were similar to those obtained from the imputed genotypes (Supplementary Table 5).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	These results indicate that the analyses based on imputed genotype data were reliable
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	There was little or no evidence of heterogeneity in the per-allele odds ratios (ORs) among studies genotyped using iCOGS (Supplementary Table 6 and Supplementary Figure 4).
0	NA	NA	rs6796502	INTRO	There was little evidence for departure from a log-additive model for any locus, except for a borderline departure for rs6796502 (P=0.049) for which the ORs for heterozygotes and homozygotes for the risk associated allele were similar (Supplementary Table 6)
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The estimated ORs for invasive versus in-situ disease were similar for all the loci (P>0.05) (Supplementary Table 7).
1	NA	NA	rs12405132	INTRO	For four of the loci, rs12405132, rs12048493, rs4593472 and rs6507583 the association was stronger for ER positive disease (case only P<0.05) (Supplementary Table 8).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Seven of the loci were associated with ER-negative disease (P<0.05) but none had a stronger association for ER-negative than ER-positive disease.
1	NA	NA	rs13162653	INTRO	Two of the loci showed significant trends in the OR by age at diagnosis: for rs13162653, the OR was higher at younger ages (P=0.007), while for rs6507583, the OR was higher at older ages (P=0.006) (Supplementary Table 9).
0	Colon and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer	ATAD5	NA	INTRO	One of the variants, chr17:29230520:D in ATAD5 is correlated with a variant that has also been shown to be associated with serous ovarian cancer in a meta-analysis (r2=0.93 between chr17:29230520:D and chr17:29181220:I)
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	To approach the task of identifying the likely causal variants and genes underlying these associations, we first defined the set of all SNPs correlated with each of the 15 lead SNPs and that could not be ruled out as potentially causal (based on a likelihood ratio 100:1), resulting in a subset of 522 variants (Supplementary Table 10).
1	NA	EXO1	rs72755295	INTRO	One of the variants, rs72755295, lies in an intron of EXO1, encoding a protein involved in mismatch repair.
1	breast cancer	EXO1	rs4149909	INTRO	It is strongly correlated with only one other variant, rs4149909, coding for an amino-acid substitution in EXO1 (p.Asn279Ser; CADD score 33), suggesting that this variant is likely to be functionally related to breast cancer risk.
0	cancers	NA	NA	INTRO	None of the remaining SNPs lay within gene coding sequences, consistent with previous observations that most common cancer susceptibility variants are regulatory.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	For each of the remaining 520 variants, we then looked for enhancer elements in mammary cell lines, based on ENCODE ChIP-Seq data.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	To identify potential gene targets, we combined this information with ENCODE ChIA-PET chromatin interaction data.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We identified two regions in which the associated variants overlapped with putative enhancer sequences and for which consistent promoter interactions were predicted (Table 1).

0	NA	RNF115	NA	INTRO	Of these, the strongest evidence was for RNF115 and PDZK1; three of the 64 potentially causal variants lay in interacting enhancer regions.
0	breast cancer	RNF115	NA	INTRO	RNF115 (also known as BCA2) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase RING finger protein that is overexpressed in ER-positive breast cancers.
0	breast cancer	PDZK1	NA	INTRO	PDZK1 is a scaffold protein that connects plasma membrane proteins and regulatory components, regulating their surface expression in epithelial cells apical domains, and has been proposed to act as an oncogene in breast cancer
1	NA	SETBP1	rs6507583	INTRO	SNPs correlated with rs6507583 at 18q12.3 lay in regions interacting with the promoter of SETBP1 (Supplementary Figure 5).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The encoded protein has been shown to bind the SET nuclear oncogene which is involved in DNA replication
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	We utilised data from TCGA to assess associations between the 15 novel susceptibility variants and expression of neighbouring genes in breast tumors and normal breast tissue.
1	NA	RPS23	rs7707921	INTRO	One SNP, rs7707921, was strongly associated with RPS23 expression in all tissues (Supplementary Table 11, Supplementary Figure 6).
0	NA	NA	rs3739	INTRO	However, stronger associations with expression were observed with more telomeric SNPs that were less strongly associated with disease risk (top eQTL SNP rs3739: P=10-23, P-risk=5.28x10-7), suggesting that this association may be coincidental.
1	cancers	ATP6AP1L	rs7707921	INTRO	SNP, rs7707921 was also more weakly associated with expression of ATP6AP1L (P=5.6x10-5 in tumours, P=0.066 in normal tissue)
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Based on the estimated ORs in the iCOGS stage (all but one of which were in the range 1.05-1.10), the 15 novel loci identified here would explain a further ~2% of the 2-fold familial risk of breast cancer.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Taken together with previously identified loci, more than 90 independent common susceptibility loci for breast cancer have been identified, explaining ~16% of the familial risk.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	We estimate assuming a log-additive model that, based on genotypes for variants at these loci, approximately 5% of women in the general population have a >2 fold increased risk of breast cancer and 0.7% of women have a >3 fold increased risk.
0	NA	MAF	NA	INTRO	In the current analyses, more than 50% of variants with MAF>0.005 in subjects of European ancestry were well imputable (r2>0.5) These results suggest that, while there may be further susceptibility variants with comparable associated effects that were not well imputed, the identification of many additional loci will require larger association studies.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	In the meantime, inclusion of these additional loci in polygenic risk scores will improve our ability to discriminate between high and low risk individuals, potentially improving breast cancer screening and prevention
