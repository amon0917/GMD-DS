1	NA	ZNF577	rs10411161	DISCUSS	We found three SNPs from ZNF577 gene region to be associated with disease susceptibility: rs10411161 (only SNP in the replication stage that showed deviation from HWE) found 2.8 kb downstream of the gene in the 3' UTR, and the other two markers rs3848562 and rs11878583 are present in the introns 2 and 6, respectively.
1	NA	ZNF577	NA	DISCUSS	The reasons for the deviation of the 3' UTR SNP in ZNF577 gene require further scrutiny and validation from independent studies.
0	breast cancer	ZNF365	rs10995190	DISCUSS	Similarly, a recent GWAS has shown a polymorphism rs10995190 located within the intron 4 of zinc finger protein 365 (ZNF365) to be associated with breast cancer susceptibility (Turnbull et al.).
1	NA	ZNF577	NA	DISCUSS	Further studies are required to understand the functional role of ZNF577
0	NA	EDNRA	rs1981867	DISCUSS	The endothelin receptor type A (EDNRA) gene is located 112.5 kb upstream of the polymorphism rs1981867, which we identified in our association study.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Its role in breast cancer susceptibility requires further attention.
0	Colon and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer	endothelin-1	NA	DISCUSS	Interestingly, constitutive co-expression of endothelin-1 growth factor and EDNRA often results in ovarian carcinoma (Salani et al.)
0	metastases	NA	NA	DISCUSS	and also contributes to bone metastases in different primary tumors (Medinger et al.)
1	NA	ROPN1L	rs1092913	DISCUSS	The ROPN1L gene on chromosome 5p15.2 is present 2.5 kb downstream of the polymorphism rs1092913.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	There is no previous evidence on the association of the gene to breast cancer susceptibility.
1	NA	ROPN1L	NA	DISCUSS	The ROPN1L gene encodes for a sperm protein known to interact with A-kinase anchoring protein (GeneCards).
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	It is evident from previous GWAS that the p arm of chromosome 5 harbors several polymorphisms implicated in breast cancer susceptibility (Stacey et al.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	; Thomas et al.).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Moreover, Lowe et al.
1	pancreatic cancer	ROPN1L	NA	DISCUSS	showed that ROPN1L gene is highly expressed in pancreatic cancer when compared to the normal pancreatic tissues and other tumors in their dataset.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Again, our results motivate further investigation in this gene
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	CONCL	We report six candidate polymorphisms that were not previously associated with breast cancer risk in Caucasian population from Alberta.
0	NA	NA	NA	CONCL	These findings merit further replication and, if confirmed, warrant fine mapping and functional validation studies
