0	lung adenocarcinomas	NA	NA	INTRO	Lung adenocarcinoma (LADC) is the most common type of lung cancer worldwide, with incidence and mortality rates increasing in both Asian and Western countries.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Recent genome studies have subdivided LADC into several categories, with mutually exclusive activations of responsible driver oncogenes.
0	sarcoma	epidermal growth factor receptor	NA	INTRO	One subset of LADC is characterized by mutations in the gene encoding epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a second with mutations in the Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homologue (KRAS) and a third with ALK, ROS1 or RET fusion, as well as other subcategories.
0	NA	ErbB	NA	INTRO	EGFR mutations are present in 30-50% of LADCs in East Asian patients, a much higher frequency than in Caucasians (10-20%).
0	NA	ErbB	NA	INTRO	A high proportion of patients with EGFR mutation-positive LADC are never-smokers and females, making the development of a preventive method critical.
0	cancers	ErbB	NA	INTRO	Advanced LADCs with EGFR mutations are often inoperable and are treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors; however, these tumours frequently become drug resistant, leading to disease progress and death.
0	NA	ErbB	NA	INTRO	Understanding the genetic factors underlying the development of LADC with EGFR mutation is required to elucidate disease aetiology and to identify effective methods of prevention
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) on lung cancer in populations of East Asian and European countries have found that several loci are associated with the risk of LDAC.
1	cancers	TERT	NA	INTRO	These include loci at chromosomes 15q25.1 (CHRNAs: cholinergic receptor, nicotinic, alpha), 5p15.33 (TERT: telomerase reverse transcriptase), 3q28 (TP63: tumour protein p63), 6p21.3 (BTNL2: butyrophilin-like 2), 10q25.1 (VTI1A: vesicle transport through interaction with t-SNAREs 1A) and 17q24.2 (BPTF: bromodomain PHD finger transcription factor).
1	NSCLC	TERT	NA	INTRO	Although a TERT polymorphism was reported to be associated with the risk of non-small cell lung cancer with the EGFR mutation, inherited genetic factors underlying the risk for LADC with the EGFR mutation have not been comprehensively analysed.
0	NA	ErbB	NA	INTRO	Here we performed a GWAS, followed by two validation studies, focusing on LADC with EGFR mutations
0	NA	ErbB	NA	RESULTS	This study enrolled 6,867 LADC patients, all of whom were informative for EGFR mutation status by routine diagnosis or by the methods described in this study (Supplementary Table 1).
0	NA	ErbB	NA	RESULTS	Of the 6,867 patients, 3,173 (46.2%) were positive for EGFR mutations, a finding consistent with previous results in Japanese patients with LADC.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Some case and control subjects/data overlapped with those in our previous GWAS (Supplementary Table 2)
0	NA	ErbB	NA	RESULTS	Germline DNAs of 663 EGFR mutation-positive LADC cases and 4,367 controls were genotyped using Illumina Omni1-Quad and OmniExpress chips, respectively (Supplementary Table 1).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	A quantile-quantile plot, generated using the results of a logistic regression trend test (Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	1A), found that the genomic inflation factor (lambdaGC) was 0.96.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The lack of population substructure between these cases and controls was validated by principal component analysis (PCA) of the subjects (Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	1B).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Genotype clusters were visually inspected for the most strongly associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and the results indicated a low possibility of false-positive associations resulting from genotype misclassification (Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	2).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	In this GWAS, no locus reached genome-wide significance for association (that is, a logistic regression trend of P<5 x 10-8) Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	1C), including loci previously reported to be associated with overall LADC risk (Supplementary Table 2).
1	NA	TP63	NA	RESULTS	Five SNPs in the four loci, TP63 at 3q28, TERT at 5p15.33, BTNL2 at 6p21.3 and BPTF at 17q24.3, were found to be more strongly associated with risk for LADC with EGFR mutation (PTrend<10-4) than other SNPs identified in GWASs of European and Asian populations
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	To identify susceptibility loci, a validation study was conducted using two independent sample sets; the first validation cohort consisted of 1,275 cases and 6,817 controls, while the second validation cohort consisted of 1,235 cases and 3,974 controls (Supplementary Table 1).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Of the 107 SNPs with P<1 x 10-4 by a logistic regression trend test (PTrend) in the GWAS, 43 were selected, with the other 64, located within the same locus (r2 >0.8), excluded.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	All 43 SNPs were genotyped successfully, using multiplex PCR-based Invader assays, in the germline DNAs of subjects in the first validation set.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Ten SNPs showed odds ratios (Ors) in the same direction with PTrend<0.05 (Supplementary Table 3).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	These 10 SNPs were assayed in the germline DNAs of subjects in the second validation set (Supplementary Table 4).
0	NA	NA	rs2179920	RESULTS	When the results of both validation sets were combined using a fixed-effects model, two SNPs, rs2179920 at 6p21.32 and rs2495239 at 6p21.1, showed significant associations after Bonferroni correction, in addition to five SNPs at four known LADC susceptibility loci (that is, PTrend<1.1 x 10-3 calculated as 0.05/43) (Table 1).
0	NA	NA	rs2179920	RESULTS	When the results of the GWAS and the validation study were combined, both novel loci showed genome-wide significance (rs2179920 at 6p21.32; PTrend=5.1 x 10-17, OR=1.36 and rs2495239 at 6p21.1; PTrend=3.9 x 10-9, OR=1.19).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	ORs were similar between the GWAS and the validation studies with no heterogeneity.
0	NA	ErbB	NA	RESULTS	Thus, six loci, represented by seven SNPs, consisting of two at previously unidentified loci and four known loci described above, were associated with the risk of LADC with EGFR mutation (Table 1).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	There were no significant differences in the association of these seven SNPs with gender or smoking status, suggesting that these loci likely affected the risk for EGFR-positive LADC, irrespective of gender and smoking status (Supplementary Table 5)
0	cancers	ErbB	NA	RESULTS	To assess the differential associations of these SNPs with LADC risk according to the presence/absence of EGFR mutations in tumour tissues, germline DNAs of 3,694 patients diagnosed with LADC without EGFR mutation were genotyped (Supplementary Table 1).
0	NA	ErbB	NA	RESULTS	Case-control analysis showed that all seven SNPs showed statistically significant or marginal association with risk for LADC without EGFR mutation, but with lower ORs than those for LADC with EGFR mutation (Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	3 and Supplementary Table 6).
1	cancers	ErbB	rs2736100	RESULTS	Case-case analysis of tumours with and without EGFR mutations showed statistically significant allelic differentiation for four of the seven SNPs, rs2736100, rs3817963, rs2179920 and rs2495239, after Bonferroni correction (Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	ErbB	NA	RESULTS	3 and Supplementary Table 7), indicating that these SNPs are significantly more strongly associated with the risk of LADC with than without EGFR mutation (that is, PTrend<7.1 x 10-3 calculated as 0.05/7)
0	NA	NA	rs2179920	RESULTS	Imputation analyses were performed using the GWAS data for the two newly identified loci, rs2179920 at 6p21.32 and rs2495239 at 6p21.1, which were found to be more strongly associated with EGFR-positive than -negative LADC.
1	NA	DPB1	rs2179920	RESULTS	The former SNP, rs2179920, was located in an intergenic region near the HLA-DPB1 (major histocompatibility complex, class II, DP beta 1) gene in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II region, and was 630 kb proximal to rs3817963, a locus in the BTNL2 gene at the border between the HLA class II and class III regions.
0	NA	HLA	NA	RESULTS	Therefore, imputation analysis was performed using the Japanese HLA imputation reference panel that included the HLA class II genes, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DPA1 and HLA-DPB1, as described elsewhere.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	A case-control study of SNPs, including imputed ones, for EGFR-positive LADC risk revealed two association peaks (Fig.
1	NA	NA	rs2179920	RESULTS	1a), one including rs2179920 as a top 10 SNP and the other including rs3817963 as the top SNP (Supplementary Tables 8 and 9).
1	NA	NA	rs2179920	RESULTS	The associations of both rs2179920 and rs3817963 SNPs with risk remained after conditioning on rs3817963 and rs2179920 genotypes, respectively (Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	1b,c and Supplementary Table 10).
0	NA	HLA	NA	RESULTS	These results indicated that the HLA class II region contains two independent susceptibility loci.
0	NA	HLA	rs2179920	RESULTS	Interestingly, assessments of the linkage disequilibrium of the risk allele of rs2179920 with non-synonymous SNP alleles of HLA class II genes showed that the strongest linkage disequilibrium for rs2179920 was with the Asp57 allele at the Glu57Asp SNP, which consists of multiple 4-digit HLA-DPB1 alleles (r2=0.98 in the binary analysis) (Supplementary Table 11).
0	NA	DPB1	Glu57Asp	RESULTS	HLA-DPB1 genotyping of 255 randomly chosen GWAS cases by the Luminex method validated that the imputation was highly accurate with a concordance rate of 99.1% for the Glu57Asp SNP between imputed and genotyped four-digit alleles.
1	NA	BTNL2	rs3817963	RESULTS	By contrast, rs3817963 of BTNL2 did not show significant linkage disequilibriums with non-synonymous SNPs of any HLA genes.
0	NA	DPB1	rs2179920	RESULTS	In the GWAS cohort, the imputed variation at amino-acid residue 57 in HLA-DPB1 showed a similar association with risk (PTrend=6.0 x 10-4) as rs2179920 (PTrend=2.6 x 10-4).
0	NA	DPB1	rs2179920	RESULTS	On the other hand, none of the imputed HLA-DPB1 alleles showed weaker associations than the marker SNP, rs2179920, and the Glu57Asp SNP (Supplementary Table 12).
0	NA	DPB1	NA	RESULTS	The amino-acid residue 57, which is located in one of the two extracellular domains of the HLA-DPB1 protein, does not make contact with antigen peptides.
0	cancers	DPB1	NA	RESULTS	Thus, the mechanism determining how the HLA-DPB1 variation affects the risk of EGFR mutation-positive LADC should be further investigated, particularly with respect to the possibility that it affects immune responses against EGFR-positive tumour cells
0	NA	NA	rs2495239	RESULTS	Imputation analyses was also performed for the other newly identified SNP, rs2495239 at 6p21.1, using the EAS population panel from the 1000 Genomes Project database (phase III).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Twenty-four imputed and genotyped SNPs showed significant associations with risk of EGFR-positive LADC (PTrend<10-4) (Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	2 and Supplementary Table 13).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Four imputed SNPs showed genome-wide significance for association (Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	2).
0	NA	ErbB	rs7741164	RESULTS	In fact, the rs7741164 SNP, the most strongly associated SNP, was also significantly associated with a higher susceptibility to EGFR mutation-positive LADC (Supplementary Table 14), indicating that 6p21.1 is an additional susceptibility locus.
1	NA	FOXP4	rs2495239	RESULTS	Interestingly, the rs2495239 SNP was located ~25 kb upstream of the FOXP4 (forkhead box P4) gene, which encodes a member of the FOXP (forkhead transcription factor) family of proteins.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	FOXP proteins play key roles in cell cycle regulation and oncogenesis.
1	lung cancer	FOXP4	rs7741164	RESULTS	Furthermore, meta-analysis, including those of studies in Japan and five other Asian countries, revealed that the FOXP4 SNP, rs7741164, is associated with a higher risk of lung cancer risk among never-smoking Asian females, consistent with the aetiology of EGFR mutation-positive LADC.
1	NA	FOXP4	rs2495239	RESULTS	Levels of FOXP4 mRNA expression in 403 non-cancerous lung tissues, as determined by real-time quantitative PCR, differed according to the rs2495239 SNP (P by the linear regression test=0.023) genotype, suggesting high expression from the risk (A) allele (Supplementary Table 15).
1	NA	FOXP4	NA	RESULTS	Therefore, a high level of FOXP4 mRNA associated with a risk allele may increase the risk of LADC with EGFR mutation by promoting oncogenesis
0	NA	ErbB	NA	DISCUSS	This study has provided evidence for genetic susceptibility to the development of LADC with EGFR mutation by identifying six susceptibility loci showing associations at genome-wide levels.
1	NA	DPB1	NA	DISCUSS	Particularly, two new loci, 6p21.32 (HLA-DPB1) and 6p21.1 (FOXP4), and two known loci, 5p15.33 (TERT) and 6p21.3 (BTNL2), were revealed to be more preferentially associated with risk of EGFR-positive than EGFR-negative LADC.
1	NA	TERT	NA	DISCUSS	The re-discovery of the TERT and BTNL2 loci is highly consistent with the fact that they these loci show strong associations with overall LADC risk, particularly in East Asians, that is, populations containing LADC cases with EGFR mutations.
0	NA	ErbB	NA	DISCUSS	Further functional studies and genetic studies of other Asian and non-Asian populations are needed to clarify how these loci affect susceptibility to EGFR mutation-positive LADC.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	EGFR-positive LADC is more prevalent in East Asian than in European/American countries.
1	NA	FOXP4	rs2495239	DISCUSS	Interestingly, the risk allele frequencies of several of the SNPs identified in this study, such as rs2495239 upstream of FOXP4 (0.38 versus 0.08 in Supplementary Table 16), are different between Asians and Europeans.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	These differences may help elucidate the aetiology of LADC, including inter-ethnic variations
