0	Type 2 diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	The genetic architecture of type 2 diabetes (T2D, MIM:125853) in Africa remains largely understudied.
1	diabetes	TCF7L2	NA	INTRO	While the reduced linkage disequilibrium (LD) characteristic of African populations was used to refine and fine map the original TCF7L2 genetic association, genome-wide and/or high throughput studies of the genetics of T2D in Africa remain limited to a genome-wide linkage analysis, and a large-scale replication study, both from the Africa America Diabetes Mellitus (AADM) Study.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	African American populations, on the other hand, have been studied more comprehensively including several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and meta-analysis of GWAS.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	However, African American populations should not be used as proxies for populations in Africa because of differences in genetic (African Americans have ~20% European admixture) as well as nongenetic risk factors (including lifestyle and behavioral factors).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Therefore, despite the advances over the last decade in our understanding of the role of genetic variants influencing T2D risk and the identification of the role of the genes in pathophysiology, data from Africa remains scarce
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	In the present study, we conduct a GWAS of T2D in Africa using data from over 5,000 Africans enrolled from Nigeria, Ghana, and Kenya as part of the Africa America Diabetes Mellitus (AADM) study, and extend the transferability of previously reported T2D loci in Africa.

0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Nowhere is this truer than in sub-Saharan Africa, which is not only the cradle of humanity but is also home to a vast diversity of populations with widely divergent lifestyle, behavioral and environmental factors including long term exposure to pathogens that have shaped the genomic architecture of African peoples.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In the present study, we report a genome-wide analysis of T2D in over 5000 sub-Saharan Africans from a single diabetes association study conducted on the continent.
1	NA	TCF7L2	rs7903146	DISCUSS	Reassuringly, TCF7L2 rs7903146 was genome-wide significant as expected from previous T2D studies in Africa, and consistent with the findings of most populations studied around the world.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We also replicated several previously reported T2D loci.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Using exact replication strategies (same SNP, consistent direction of effect, p value < 0.05), we demonstrated that 15% of the reported loci were significantly associated in this study of sub-Saharan Africans.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This is consistent with our estimates of the power of our study to replicate known loci considering effect allele frequencies and reported effect sizes.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Using local replication strategies, which help to identify significant loci which would otherwise have been missed because of allele frequency and/or LD differences between populations, we replicated additional sixteen loci (i.e., significant p value in a SNP in LD with the original reported SNP).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	These findings extend our previous studies of transferability of T2D loci in sub-Sharan Africa.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Notably, the present study's exact replication rate of 15% is marginally more than the 11% that we previously reported in a smaller sample from the same study.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	While this difference is not statistically significant (p = 0.369, test of difference between proportions), it suggests that larger sample sizes may lead to increased numbers of replicated variants because of increased statistical power.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	It should be noted that transferability of reported T2D genome-wide significant variants between populations has always been demonstrable for a relatively small fraction of all such loci, especially with African ancestry populations.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Perhaps this is not unexpected given that transferability is affected by several factors, including sample sizes, effect allele frequencies, LD structure, and genetic architecture of the trait.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	While acknowledging that increased sample size is just one of these variables, an appreciation of the final set of consistently replicable variants across populations will probably become possible when sample sizes (and the resultant statistical power) in non-European studies begin to approach those of European GWAS
0	NA	ZRANB3	NA	DISCUSS	A notable finding in the present study is the identification of a previously unidentified locus for T2D, namely ZRANB3 (Zinc Finger RANBP2-Type Containing 3).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Two intronic SNPs in the gene were genome-wide significant and the direction of effect was consistent for the top four SNPs in a South African Zulu sample with the meta-analysis p values of the two SNPs remaining genome-wide significant.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The SNPs are African-specific and were discovered by sequencing of African genomes in the African Genome Resources Haplotype Reference Panel.
0	NA	ZRANB3	NA	DISCUSS	Our functional annotation of the ZRANB3 locus identified several cis- and trans-eQTLs, indicating that the locus contains multiple functional variants.
0	NA	MCM6	NA	DISCUSS	Of relevance to T2D is our findings of two known-T2D associated genes associated with cis-eQTLs (MCM6, DARS) and four with trans-eQTLs (DGKB, GTF3AP5-AGMO, IL23R/IL12RB2, SLC44A4).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The DGKB/GTF3AP5-AGMO region has the most annotation to GWAS hits with variants in the genes showing genome-wide significant associations with T2D, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) traits and glycated hemoglobin.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	IL23R/IL12RB2 is a known GWAS locus for age of onset of T2D, while variants in SLC44A4 have been implicated in the interaction between T2D and iron status biomarkers.
0	NA	MCM6	NA	DISCUSS	Variants in MCM6 and DARS were recently shown to be associated with total cholesterol change in response to fenofibrate in statin-treated T2D
0	NA	ZRANB3	NA	DISCUSS	Our functional assays in zebrafish focused on the role of the ZRANB3 ortholog in the pancreas, one of the key tissues in T2D.
0	pancreatic	ZRANB3	NA	DISCUSS	RNA-seq expression datasets of isolated beta-cells showed expression of zranb3 in the principal zebrafish pancreatic islet.
0	pancreatic	ZRANB3	NA	DISCUSS	Knockdown of the gene led to reduced zranb3 expression and to reduction in pancreatic beta-cell number in the developing organism, which we confirmed in progeny of animals having nonsense mutations introduced into zranb3 by CRISPR.
0	NA	Zranb3	NA	DISCUSS	These observations are consistent with recent evidence suggesting that Zranb3 is highly expressed in replicating murine beta-cells, suggesting a likely critical role of the gene in production or maintenance of beta-cells.
0	NA	ZRANB3	NA	DISCUSS	The reduction in zebrafish beta-cell mass that we observed was shown to be due to a reproducible increase in apoptosis present in islets of animals with zranb3 knockdown.
0	pancreatic cancer	ZRANB3	NA	DISCUSS	The effect of zranb3 deficiency in the pancreas seems to be specific to beta-cells as glucagon in islets is similar between knockout/knockdown and wild-type zebrafish.
0	NA	insulin	NA	DISCUSS	Glucose tolerance/uptake studied in the animals did not show a defect in glucose uptake that would indicate changes in insulin sensitivity or glucose disposal.
0	Neurological and Communication Disorders	ZRANB3	NA	DISCUSS	We also found that Zranb3 knockdown in a mammalian cell line (MIN6 beta-cells) resulted in an impairment of secretion of insulin in response to high glucose.
0	Neurological and Communication Disorders	ZRANB3	NA	DISCUSS	Overall, the findings from these experiments support an important role for ZRANB3 in T2D that is mediated through a mechanism of impaired insulin response at the level of maintenance and function of beta-cell mass.
0	glucose metabolism alterations	ZRANB3	NA	DISCUSS	These findings in combination with the eQTL findings suggest that the ZRANB3 locus may act directly, through other loci that it regulates (e.g., DGKB, GTF3AP5-AGMO, and IL23R/IL12RB2) or in combination with those loci to produce the pathophysiological changes that lead to altered glucose metabolism and T2D
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Integrative analysis of GWAS and transcriptomic studies are increasingly being utilized to identify novel candidate genes which may not have been detected through either type of study alone as illustrated by loci above the null line and towards the upper right quadrant of Fig.

0	NA	MARCH1	NA	DISCUSS	We found some candidate genes of which two (MARCH1 and LIPC) are established T2D-related loci.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The fact that they were not significant in our study indicates that integrative analysis can boost the capacity of a GWAS to identify and/or prioritize loci for further study.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	One of the major drawbacks of this type of integrative analysis is the relatively small sample sizes of most transcriptomic datasets, which limits the power of the eQTL studies.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, this limitation would gradually diminish as more data are generated
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The identification of a previously unidentified candidate T2D locus in the present study provides further support for the notion that genome analysis studies in diverse global populations have the potential to discover novel risk loci and improve our knowledge of the genetic architecture of many common complex disorders.
0	Type 2 diabetes	SLC6A11	NA	DISCUSS	For T2D, this has been demonstrated in studies which identified SLC6A11 in Mexicans by the SIGMA Type 2 Diabetes Consortium, SGCG in Punjabi Sikhs, and KCNQ1 in East Asians as novel risk loci for T2D.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In the search for novel loci, this strategy of including populations of different ancestries complements the strategy of increasing sample sizes to boost statistical power to detect small effect sizes
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The present study addressed discovery science in the context of under-represented populations in genomic research, partly in response to the lack of diversity and predominance of European ancestry populations in genomic studies.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Several examples now exist for how lack of diversity in genomic studies is resulting in missed opportunities for discoveries and for more robust understanding of heterogeneity in effect sizes across ethnic groups.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	A recent example from the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology study demonstrated that one-quarter of genetic associations in the NHGR-EBI GWAS Catalog show significant heterogeneity in effects sizes between ethnicities.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Given that effect sizes are estimates of risk, this implies that risk prediction would vary substantially depending on the ethnic group.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	It is important to recognize that the effects of this lack of diversity extend beyond discovery science to translational studies because the resulting gaps in knowledge may lead to missed opportunities for developing clinical guidelines, better tailoring of clinical guidelines and treatment protocols and developing new therapeutic agents.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Highlighting these issues further is the recent call for better calibration of polygenetic risk scores (PRS) to enhance transethnic utility with the hope of not exacerbating already unacceptable health disparities as PRS is used to identify high-risk individuals for early intervention in clinical and public health settings
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The strengths of the present study include a relatively large sample size, a focus on an understudied ancestral group, use of state-of-the-art SNP microarrays and imputation to an African enriched reference panel providing an unparalleled comprehensive opportunity to test millions of common SNPs across African genomes.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	A potential limitation is that SNPs with small effect sizes are not detectable with the present sample size.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	More studies in Africans and combined analysis using meta-analytic procedures would overcome this limitation
1	NA	TCF7L2	NA	DISCUSS	In summary, this GWAS of T2D in over 5000 sub-Saharan Africans replicated several known T2D loci, including TCF7L2 and identified ZRANB3 as a T2D locus.
