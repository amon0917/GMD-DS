0	breast cancer	NA	rs4784227	DISCUSS	In this multi-stage GWA study of over 15,486 cases and 13,001 controls, we identified SNP rs4784227 as highly significantly associated with breast cancer in both Asians (per allele OR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.20-1.31, P = 3.2x10-25) and European Americans (per allele OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.09-1.31, P = 1.3x10-4).
0	breast cancer	NA	rs4784227	DISCUSS	SNP rs4784227 is located at 16q12.1, a region reported previously to harbor breast cancer genetic risk variants among European descendents.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In Asians, however, this SNP is either not in LD or only in weak LD with any of the three previously-reported SNPs in these regions, and adjusting for these SNPs did not alter the association of breast cancer with this newly-identified SNP.
0	breast cancer	NA	rs4784227	DISCUSS	Although in European Americans rs4784227 is in strong LD with one of the previously-reported SNPs, rs3803602, the positive association of rs4784227 with breast cancer remained after adjusting for previously-reported SNPs.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In vitro experiments showed that risk allele T reduced luciferase activity and altered DNA-protein binding patterns.
0	breast cancer	NA	rs4784227	DISCUSS	These results implicate rs4784227 as a functional genetic risk variant for breast cancer, and this SNP may explain, at least partially, the association of breast cancer with other SNPs identified in 16q12.1
0	NA	TNRC9	rs4784227	DISCUSS	SNP rs4784227 is located 18.4 kb upstream of the TOX3 gene and in the evolutionarily-conserved region of intron of the LOC643714 gene.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Several transcription factors are predicted to bind to this SNP (http://www.cbrc.jp/research/db/TFSEARCH.html).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This SNP, however, has not been shown to be in the coding region for any non-coding RNA or miRNA/snoRNA/scaRNA based on UCSC Genome Browser.
0	breast cancer	NA	rs4784227	DISCUSS	Our luciferase reporter assays showed that the intronic region harboring rs4784227 may have intrinsic repressor activities, suggesting that rs4784227 may affect its underlying gene LOC643714 or its neighborhood gene expression and thus affect breast cancer risk.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The rs4784227-associated repressing activity could be the result of differential binding affinity of transcription machinery to the rs4784227-containing DNA sequences.
0	NA	NA	rs4784227	DISCUSS	We examined this hypothesis by conducting electrophoretic mobility shift assays and confirmed that the risk T allele of rs4784227 significantly alter DNA-nuclear protein(s) interactions.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Thus, it is possible that inhibitory nuclear protein(s) selectively bind to the risk allele T to repress transcription.
0	NA	HNF-3b	rs4784227	DISCUSS	A database search (http://www.cbrc.jp/research/db/TFSEARCH.html) for transcription factor binding sites showed that the sequence at the rs4784227 site has a high degree of similarity with several consensus elements recognized by transcription factors, of which HNF-3b and C/EBP prefer to bind DNA fragments with the risk T allele of this SNP site.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, these putative transcription factors or their associated proteins have not been confirmed to be involved in the regulation of LOC643714 or its nearby genes
0	breast cancer	NA	rs4784227	DISCUSS	In summary, through a GWA study we have identified and confirmed rs4784227 as a genetic risk variant for breast cancer.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In vitro experiments showed a functional significance of this SNP that may explain the association of breast cancer with other SNPs identified at locus 16q12.1.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This study demonstrates the importance of conducting genetic association studies in populations with different LD structures to identify causal genetic variants for breast cancer and other complex diseases
