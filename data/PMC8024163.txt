0	Type 2 diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	Previous research has revealed risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) including body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, blood pressure, family history, and genetic background
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Many investigators have assumed that identification of genetic factors will improve the prediction of T2DM, so many genetic studies have been performed.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	With the advent of high-throughput genotyping technologies, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have become prevalent.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Several hundreds of thousands of tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which represent genotype variation of neighboring SNPs, are selected and probes for the tag SNPs are used in SNP microarray chips.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Usually, more than 10,000 samples are used and imputed with a reference panel from a population sequencing project such as the 1000 Genome Project.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	These GWASs have been actively applied to the study of T2DM, and meta-analysis of the individual GWASs identifies genome-wide loci associated significantly with the development of T2DM.

0	obese	TCF7L2	rs4506565	DISCUSS	found that rs4506565 near transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) had different associations in a nonobese group (BMI >=30; OR, 1.54) and an obese group (BMI >30; OR, 1.20).
0	obese	LAMA1	rs8090011	DISCUSS	In another GWAS for T2DM using BMI subgroups [39], rs8090011 in LAMA1 had genome-wide significance in lean individuals (BMI <25; P=8.4x10-9) and not in obese individuals (BMI >=30; P=0.04).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Timpson et al.
0	obese	FTO	rs8050136	DISCUSS	also reported that rs8050136 of fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) gene was detectable in the obese group (BMI >=30.2; P=1.3x10-13), while the significance disappeared in the nonobese group (BMI <30.2; P=0.19).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Besides significance, prediction performance differs according to the BMI subgroups.
0	respiratory tract infections	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In the prediction analysis of T2DM with GRS of 65 common variants, samples of the lowest tertile (BMI <24.5) had an NRI of 27.6%, while those of the upper tertile (BMI >27.5) had an NRI of 2.6%.
0	obese	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Previous studies showed that the prediction model with GRS outperformed in the lean body group than in the obese group, but our result was different.
0	obese	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The difference of AUC and magnitude of reclassification was greater in the obese group.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	While GWASs have been identifying susceptible loci for diabetes, previous studies have shown that integration of genetic information or GRS from GWAS results increased the performance of diabetes prediction marginally.
0	obese	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, we found that the prediction performance increased in obese group more than in whole population.
0	obese	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In the obese group, the clinic-genetic prediction model increased AUC marginally, but cNRI significantly (P=8.00x10-5).
0	obese	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Moreover, permutation test revealed that the AUC of prediction model of obese group is significant (Supplementary method).
0	obese	NA	NA	DISCUSS	These results indicate that the clinic-genetic model of obese group increased overall prediction performance marginally, but re-assign risk probability to patients more accurately.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Clinically, it would be helpful when patients need to be matched to a preventive protocol because risk assessment is more accurate.
0	obese	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Considering obese group had limited number of population in general, it might be cost-effective to apply such model to the specific subgroup of population
0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	These seemed to indicate that the genetic information may be more valuable predictor of diabetes in a specific subpopulation.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The identification of such groups should be investigated in further research.
0	obese	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In addition, each loci showed the same tendency of high performance of prediction in obese group (Supplementary Table 4).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This might result from our use of exonic variants in the prediction model.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We thought that the change of prediction accuracy between BMI subgroups results from epigenetic change of the loci.
0	obese	KCNQ1	NA	DISCUSS	It is reported that the KCNQ1 gene of blood cells is hyper-methylated in obese population.
0	NA	KCNQ1	NA	DISCUSS	If so, it is also possible that KCNQ1 gene of diabetes-related cells can be hyper-methylated, which might result in change of KCNQ1 gene expression, and prediction accuracy of the loci eventually.
0	obese	KCNQ1	NA	DISCUSS	Considering that KCNQ1 contains two loci of the significant results in this analysis, it is possible that higher AUC is associated with methylation change, and the other loci might also have the methylation changes nearby the loci, which affect the prediction accuracy in obese group
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In summary, we found significant exonic variants for T2DM, which were previously identified or newly detected.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Genetic prediction using the loci showed a mild but significant increase of AUC and NRI.
0	obese	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We found that the variants had higher performance in the obese group than in the normal and overweight groups.
