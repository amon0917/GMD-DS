0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies among women in the world.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Although breast cancer patients have generally a good prognosis, because the 5-year survival for invasive breast cancer cases from 1999 to 2005 was about 90%, large differences exist in survival rate because of a variety of clinicopathological prognostic factors.
0	metastases	NA	NA	INTRO	The tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging system approved by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) is a well-known important prognostic factor.
0	cancers	progesterone receptor	NA	INTRO	However, there are prognostic differences within specific stages because of the biological heterogeneity of tumors; thus, additional tumor markers such as tumor grade, lymphovascular invasion, proliferation markers, estrogen and progesterone receptor (ER and PR) status, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpression have been suggested to provide a more precise prognosis of breast cancer
0	breast cancer	HER2	NA	INTRO	Among those prognostic factors, ER, PR, and HER2 status have been used for breast tumor subtypes classification in terms of heterogeneous clinical behavior and systematic therapy recommendations.
0	cancers	HER2	NA	INTRO	The tumor subtype based on ER, PR, and HER2 status has been validated in independent data set with significant differences in their clinical features even in Asian and European, early and metastatic breast cancer patients suggesting the robust classification
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	In addition to clinicopathological prognostic factors, there is evidence supporting that inherited genetic factors influence the prognosis of breast cancer.
0	breast cancer	C10orf11	NA	INTRO	Several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified common variants associated with the prognosis of breast cancer at multiple genetic loci including C10orf11, ARRDC3, RAD51L1, PBX1, RoR alpha, SYT6, NTN1, OCA2, and ZFHX3 genes.
0	breast cancer	HER2	NA	INTRO	Although genetic susceptibility markers influence differently the prognosis as well as the risk of breast cancer based on the ER, PR, and/or HER2 status, there are no genetic association studies on the prognosis of breast cancer which consider the heterogeneity of intrinsic tumor subtypes composed of various combinations of ER, PR, and HER2 status
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	In this study, we hypothesized that the association of breast cancer prognosis with common genetic variants may vary by breast tumor subtypes.
0	breast cancer	HER2	NA	INTRO	This study aims to conduct a two-stage GWAS for disease-free survival (DFS) in breast cancer stratified by tumor subtypes defined by the ER, PR, and HER2 status and evaluate the performance of prognostic models that included genetic variants with well-known clinical factors

0	breast cancer	HER2	NA	DISCUSS	We conducted a subtype-specific GWAS, unlike other previous studies that had conducted a GWAS for overall breast cancer before stratifying by ER, PR, and HER2 status because breast cancer is considered as a heterogeneous disease for which the prognosis varies across subtypes.
0	breast cancer	HER2	NA	DISCUSS	This intertumor heterogeneity is plausible in that breast cancer could originate from different cell types according to the tumor subtype and is supported by previous studies showing the heterogeneous associations between SNPs and the prognosis of breast cancer by ER, PR and HER2 status, in agreement with the current study (Fig 2).
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Another reason for the subtype-specific analyses was that breast cancer subtypes are considered as a predictor factor that distinguishes different responses to particular therapies among patients.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Because those differences in responses to particular therapies could have been a result of subtype-specific biological differences, the stratification of breast tumors by subtypes is necessary

0	cancers	HER2	rs9934948	DISCUSS	Although the association of SNP rs9934948 was not in the same direction as in this study, the reason for this might be because the tumor subtypes, specifically HR+ and HR-, had a different tumor biology from that of ErbB2, and the luminal subtypes showed entirely different up-regulated gene patterns even in the same organ relapse patients.
