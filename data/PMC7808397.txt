0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Based on the largest GWAS to date from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC), over 170 independent breast cancer susceptibility variants have been identified.
0	cancers	NA	NA	INTRO	Many of these variants show differential associations by tumor subtypes, particularly ER-positive versus ER-negative or triple-negative disease.

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We described the two-stage polytomous logistic regression in more detail elsewhere (Supplementary Note).
0	cancers	NA	NA	METHODS	In brief, this method allows for efficient testing of a variant-disease association in the presence of tumor subtype heterogeneity defined by multiple tumor characteristics, while accounting for multiple testing and missing data on tumor characteristics.
0	cancers	NA	NA	METHODS	In the first stage, the model uses a polytomous logistic regression to model case-control ORs between the variants and all possible subtypes that could be of interest, defined by the combination of the tumor markers.
0	NA	ER	NA	METHODS	For example, in a model fit to evaluate heterogeneity according to ER, PR and HER2 positive/negative status, and grade of differentiation (low, intermediate and high grade), the first stage incorporates case-control ORs for 24 subtypes defined by the cross-classification of these factors.
0	cancers	NA	NA	METHODS	The second stage restructures the first-stage subtype-specific case-control ORs parameters into second-stage parameters through a decomposition procedure resulting in a second-stage baseline parameter that represents a case-control OR of a baseline cancer subtype, and case-case ORs parameters for each individual tumor characteristic.
0	cancers	NA	NA	METHODS	The second-stage case-case parameters can be used to perform heterogeneity tests with respect to each specific tumor marker while adjusting for the other tumor markers in the model.
0	cancers	NA	NA	METHODS	"The two-stage model efficiently handles missing data by implementing an Expectation-Maximization algorithm that essentially performs iterative ""imputation"" of the missing tumor characteristics conditional on available tumor characteristics and baseline covariates based on an underlying two-stage polytomous model."
0	cancers	NA	NA	METHODS	In the two-stage model, the frequency of different tumor subtypes corresponding to different combinations of the tumor characteristics are allowed to vary freely through the model-free specification of the intercepts of the first-stage polytomous model (alpham, see Supplementary Note for details), in other words, the intercepts are kept saturated.
0	cancers	NA	NA	METHODS	As these parameters are estimated from the data itself, the methodology accounts for the correlation among the tumor markers in a robust manner that does not require strong modelling assumptions
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	To identify novel susceptibility loci, we used both a fixed-effect two-stage polytomous model and a mixed-effect two-stage polytomous model.
0	cancers	NA	NA	METHODS	The score-test we developed based on the mixed-effect model allows coefficients associated with individual tumor characteristics to enter as either fixed- or random-effect terms.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Our previous analyses have shown that incorporation of random effect terms can improve power of the score-test by essentially reducing the effective degrees-of-freedom associated with fixed effects related to exploratory markers (i.e., markers for which there is little prior evidence to suggest that they are a source of heterogeneity).
0	cancers	ER	NA	METHODS	On the other hand, incorporation of fixed-effect terms can preserve distinct associations of known important tumor characteristics, such as ER.
0	NA	ER	NA	METHODS	In the mixed-effect two-stage polytomous model, we therefore kept ER as a fixed effect, but modeled PR, HER2 and grade as random effects.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We evaluated variants with MAF >0.01 (~10.0 million) and r2>=0.3, and excluded variants within +-500 kb of, or in LD (r2>=0.1) with known susceptibility variants.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	A MAF >0.01 was chosen to ensure an adequate sample size to generate stable estimates.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We reported variants that passed the p-value threshold of P < 5.0 x 10-8 in either the fixed- or mixed-effect models
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Both fixed/mixed-effect models adjusted for top ten PCs and age.
0	cancers	NA	NA	METHODS	As age is correlated with the tumor characteristics, we added age as a covariate to improve the statistical power of Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Country was not adjusted for in the subtype analyses, since doing so required adequate sample size of each subtype in each country to allow for convergence of the two-stage polytomous model.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Instead, we assessed the influence of country on signals identified by the two-stage models by performing a 'leave one out' sensitivity analyses in which we reevaluated novel signals after excluding data from each individual country.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Data from the OncoArray and iCOGS arrays were analyzed separately and then meta-analyzed using fixed-effects meta-analysis
0	breast cancer	BRCA1	NA	METHODS	We tested for associations between variants and breast cancer risk for BRCA1 mutation carriers using a score test statistic based on the retrospective likelihood of observing the variant genotypes conditional on breast cancer phenotypes (breast cancer status and censoring time).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Analyses were performed separately for iCOGS and OncoArray data.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	To allow for non-independence among related individuals, a kinship-adjusted test was used that accounted for familial correlations.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We stratified analyses by country of residence and, for countries where the strata were sufficiently large (United States and Canada), by Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The results from the iCOGS and OncoArray data were then pooled using fixed-effects meta-analysis
0	breast cancer	BRCA1	NA	METHODS	As the great majority of BRCA1 related breast cancers are triple-negative, we performed a meta-analysis with the BCAC triple-negative results to increase the power to detect associations for the triple-negative subtype.
0	NA	BRCA1	NA	METHODS	We performed a fixed-effects meta-analysis of the results from BCAC triple-negative cases and CIMBA BRCA1 mutation carriers, using an inverse-variance fixed-effects approach implemented in METAL.
0	breast cancer	BRCA1	NA	METHODS	The estimates of association used were the logarithm of the per-allele hazard ratio estimate for association with breast cancer risk for BRCA1 mutation carriers from CIMBA and the logarithm of the per-allele odds ratio estimate for association with risk of triple-negative breast cancer based on BCAC data
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We performed two sets of conditional analyses.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	First, we investigated for evidence of multiple independent signals in identified loci by performing forward selection logistic regression, in which we adjusted the lead variant and analyzed association for all remaining variants within +-500 kb of the lead variants, irrespective of LD.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Second, we confirmed the independence of 20 variants that were located within +-2 MB of a known susceptibility region by conditioning the identified signals on the nearby known signal.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Since these 20 variants are already genome-wide significant in the original GWAS scan and the conditional analyses restricted to local regions, we therefore used a significance threshold of P < 1 x 10-6 to control for type-one error
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We evaluated all novel signals for evidence of heterogeneity using the two-stage polytomous model.
0	cancers	ER	NA	METHODS	We first performed a global test for heterogeneity under the mixed-effect model test to identify variants showing evidence of heterogeneity with respect to any of the underlying tumor markers, ER, PR, HER2 and/or grade.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We accounted for multiple testing of the global heterogeneity test using a FDR <0.05 under the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.
0	cancers	NA	NA	METHODS	Among the variants with observed heterogeneity, we then further used a fixed-effect two-stage model to evaluate influence of specific tumor characteristic(s) driving observed heterogeneity, adjusted for the other markers in the model.
0	NA	ER	NA	METHODS	We also fit a separate fixed-effect two-stage models to estimate case-control ORs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for five surrogate intrinsic-like subtypes defined by combinations of ER, PR, HER2 and grade: (1) luminal A-like (ER+ and/or PR+, HER2-, grade 1 & 2); (2) luminal B/HER2-negative-like (ER+ and/or PR+, HER2-, grade 3); (3) luminal B-like (ER+ and/or PR+, HER2+); (4) HER2-enriched-like (ER- and PR-, HER2+), and (5) triple-negative (ER-, PR-, HER2-).
0	cancers	NA	NA	METHODS	Further, we conducted sensitivity analysis by fitting a standard polytomous model among cases with complete data on the five-intrinsic-like subtypes for the 32 novel variants and compared these results with the results from two-stage polytomous model accounting for missing tumor data
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We defined credible sets of candidate causal variants (CCVs) as variants located within +-500 kb of the lead variants in each novel region and with P values within 100-fold of magnitude of the lead variants.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	This is approximately equivalent to selecting variants whose posterior probability of causality is within two orders of magnitude of the most significant variant.

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Genetic variance corresponds to heritability on the frailty-scale, which assumes a polygenetic log-additive model as the underlying model.
0	breast cancer	BRCA1	NA	METHODS	Under the log-additive model, the frailty-scale heritability explained by the identified variants can be estimated by:  where n is the total number of identified variants, pi is the MAF for ith variant,  is the log odds ratio estimate for the ith variant, and taui is the is the standard error of  To obtain the frailty scale heritability for invasive breast cancer explained by all of the GWAS variants, we used LD score regression to estimate heritability  using the full set of summary statistics from either standard logistic regression for overall invasive breast cancer, the two-stage polytomous regression for the intrinsic-like subtypes, or the CIMBA BRCA1 analysis for BRCA1 carriers.

0	breast cancer	NA	NA	METHODS	To estimate the proportion of the familial risk of invasive breast cancer that is explained by susceptibility variants, we defined the familial relative risk, lambda, as the familial relative risk assuming a polygenic log-additive model that explains all the familial aggregation of the disease.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Under the frailty scale, we define the broad sense heritability as sigma2.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The relationship between lambda and sigma2 was shown to be sigma2 = 2 * log(lambda).
