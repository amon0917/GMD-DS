0	lung cancer	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	The well-established association of the genomic region 15q25 to lung cancer might be influenced by exposure to radon among uranium miners.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Further, lung cancer susceptibility is related to the functional capability of DNA damage signalling via ubiquitination processes and repair of radiation-induced double-strand breaks by the single-strand annealing mechanism
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	You cannot see it; you cannot hear it and you cannot smell it; but be aware it is omnipresent in indoor and outdoor air and contaminates many underground mines.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Radon is a radioactive noble gas released by the uranium decay chain.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	An increased risk for lung cancer (LC), the main cause of cancer-related death worldwide, caused by inhalation of radon has been consistently demonstrated in several studies of indoor-exposure in dwellings as well as for uranium miners.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	It was estimated, that ionising radiation due to residential radon causes 3% to 15% of LC cases in the general population.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	That is why radon is the second strongest risk factor for LC and among the top 4 environmental risks to public health in the United States
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Pooled analyses of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) within the International Lung Cancer Consortium (ILCCO) have revealed that genomic variations at e.g.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	5p15.33, 6p21-22 and 15q25 and further 42 LC susceptibility loci influence LC risk in European populations.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In total 92 genes are postulated to be suspected causal genes for LC.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Although the strongest genetic association with an odds ratio (OR) of 7.2 was reported for 15q25 in a familial form of LC, for sporadic LC an OR of only ~1.3 was observed, albeit highly significant (p = 3.08 x 10-103).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	"However, ""cumulative effects of loci have shown promising results to improve the discriminatory performance of risk prediction models"" Nevertheless, genes can be associated to several traits and contribute to the functional efficacy of multiple interlocked biological processes."
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	One may assume that for example nicotine dependency or DNA repair play a role in an individual's susceptibility to developing LC.
0	chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	CHRNA5	NA	INTRO	For example, some genetic variants in CHRNA5 on chromosome 15q25.1 increase the risk for smoking-related disorders such as LC and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) but are also associated with delayed smoking cessation.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Taken together, the harming mechanisms of smoking consist at least in parts of a complex interplay between tobacco exposure, previous diseases and genetics.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	However, smoking is the most important but an avoidable risk factor
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Exposure to radon is ubiquitous and not self-inflicted, but can be reduced in homes and buildings; the related biological defence mechanisms are complex.
0	prostate carcinogenesis	NA	NA	INTRO	DNA damage, induced by radioactive alpha particles emitted by radon progenies, is considered as pivotal mechanism of carcinogenesis in the lung.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	A heritable component in the capacity to repair DNA-damage was demonstrated.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Ionizing radiation induces oxidation of DNA bases and generates single-strand breaks (SSBs) and double-strand breaks (DSBs).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	An individual's capacity to repair DSBs is recognised as a risk factor or an effect modifier in LC.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	DSBs capacity determining genes are widely investigated as susceptibility genes for lung cancer.
0	NA	GSTM	NA	INTRO	The interaction of radon with some genes belonging to biological mechanisms other than DNA damage response was also investigated with candidate gene approaches in either high dose exposed uranium miners (SIRT1; P53; CDKN2A and MGMT; IL6) or low dose exposed humans in dwellings (GSTM, GSTT and EPHX1; P53).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Nevertheless, it is still unclear which genomic dispositions make one susceptible to radiation-induced LC
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The uranium miners of the former German Wismut mining company, with about 400 000 employees, form a large population with documented radiation exposure.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In 2009 the German Federal Office of Radiation Protection (Bundesamt fur Strahlenschutz, BfS) started to build up the German Uranium Miners Bio- and Databank (GUMB) with DNA from blood and/or tissue samples from LC cases and healthy controls of former uranium miners of this company.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Exposure estimations and data are captured in the same way as for a large cohort study of the same population and includes an estimate of the cumulative occupational exposure to radon progeny
0	cancers	NA	NA	INTRO	This work was conducted as collaboration between the Transdisciplinary Research of Cancer in Lung and the International Lung Cancer Consortium (TRICL/ILCCO), the German Federal Office of Radiation Protection (BfS) and the University Medical Centre Gottingen.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We merged phenotypic and genotypic information from TRICL/ILCCO and from BfS.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Genotypes were yielded by the OncoArray, to perform a genome-wide search for radon x gene interaction -without restricting the investigation to any presumed mode of action
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The participating studies of TRICL/ILCCO are individually described in the supplement of, Table 1 and Supplementary Table I (Online Resource 1).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The LC cases of the BfS sample collection were recruited for a study investigating indoor-radon exposure between 1990 und 1997.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The cancer-free BfS controls are former uranium miners recruited from 2009-2012, who continuously participated in health surveillance program of the German Social Accident Insurance and are long term survivors.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	This control samples stored in German Uranium Miners Biobank (GUMB) of the BfS were drawn from these miners, which were either very high (>750 Working Level Months, WLM) or low (<=50 WLM) radiation exposed in a targeted and no-representative ratio of 2:1.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The method how radon exposures was measured is given elsewhere (see Scaling residential and occupational radon exposure, Online Resource 1)
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	METHODS	The analysed sample consisted of 28 599 study participants with European ancestry and valid information on age at diagnosis/interview, sex and smoking status (15 077 cases : 13 522 controls); 463 thereof are former uranium miners of the Wismut mining company (61 cases : 402 controls), 949 are from the German Lung Cancer Study (471 cases : 478 controls), the remaining are from 25 studies of TRICL/ILCCO (14 545 cases : 12 642 controls) (see Table 1 and Supplementary Table I, Online Resource 1).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	49 of 15 077 (0.3%) LC cases and 259 of 13 522 cancer-free controls (1.9%) had been occupationally exposed by a high cumulative dose exposure to radon and its progeny (WLM>50).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	It is unlikely that a cumulative lifetime exposure solely due to an exposure by indoor or other environmental radon sums up to more than 50 WLM.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	"Thus, we categorised occupational radon exposure into <=50 (""unexposed"") and >50 WLM (""exposed""), a threshold for significant elevated relative LC-risk."
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	All TRICL/ILCCO participants were assigned to the exposure categories <=50 WLM.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Misclassification would be conservative.

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The Infinium OncoArray-500K was used for high-throughput genotyping.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Quality control (QC) was performed following the approach previously described for the OncoArray.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	To validate the European ancestry of the participants the probability of being Caucasian based on a set of 159 ancestry- and PCA-informative markers was estimated applying the program ADMIXTURE.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	407 117 markers entered the analysis, after excluding markers of low quality genotyping or a minor allele frequencies (MAF) <1%.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	These remaining markers could be clustered into 103 983 blocks (67 161 LD blocks and 36 822 hot spots; for definition see Online Resource 1)
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The crude odds ratio (OR) for the occupational radon exposure within participants of the BfS sample collection was OR=2.25.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Because naively adding the TRICL/ILCCO participants would biased this association to OR=0.17, we down-weighted the cases of TRICL/ILCCO by the factor 1 : 13.6.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	In this way we avoided this unjustified inversion of the crude association, and still use all available information for analysis.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	However, we have fixed the marginal risk of a radon exposure at the point estimate from the BfS sample collection (for a more detailed explanation see Online Resource 1)
0	NA	GSA	NA	METHODS	We fitted two models to individual data and also carried out a gene-set analysis (GSA) to search for accumulated significance in pre-defined groups of genes for pathways and gene families of interest.

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We first performed single-marker interaction analysis fitting the log-additive model:
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	where D is the disease status (D=1: LC patient; D=0: control); G is minor allele count at marker m; E is the exposure category (0: <=50 WLM, 1: WLM>50); PS is a propensity score comprising the probability being a case explained by age, sex and smoking.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	To adjust for genomic population stratification we calculated the principal components (PC) of genotypes.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Only the first four PCs were included in the statistical modelling, because the fifth PC was significantly correlated with the disease status.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The remaining inflation factor (median of the chi2-distribution for unadjusted association) was lambda~1.1, which is acceptable close to 1.0
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The data at hand are not a representative data set of a well-defined source population.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Thus the effect estimate of interaction, expressed as odds ratio, is potentially proportionally biased.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Therefore, the tilde is added to indicate that a weighted sample was used for estimation (see Merging samples).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	However, estimating OR is not our main interest, rather than testing the null hypothesis, which is still valid
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	With as global level of significance, we use as Bonferroni-corrected, genome-wide level of significance.

0	lung adenocarcinomas	CHRNA5	NA	DISCUSS	An up-regulation of CHRNA5 and a down-regulation of CHRNA3 in lung adenocarcinoma as compared with the normal lung was observed.
0	cancers	CHRNA3	NA	DISCUSS	However CHRNA3 is not required to maintain cancer cell proliferation
0	NA	CHRNA3	rs16969968	DISCUSS	The marker rs16969968 assigned to CHRNA3 was most detailed discussed as associated with smoking quantity and nicotine dependence, suggesting that this variant confers risk of LC through its effect on tobacco addiction.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Interestingly, no modification of risk was found across smoking categories or histological subtypes of LC.
0	prostate carcinogenesis	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Also, evidence exists that nAChRs can be directly associated with lung carcinogenesis owing to the complexity of nAChR function in the brain.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This is of interest, since a sub-multiplicative interaction between radon and smoking in causing LC was speculated independently in several uranium miner cohorts and case-control studies.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The estimated excess relative risk (ERR) per WLM was higher for never than for current smokers (e.g.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	ERR/WLM=0.012 for never and long-term ex-smokers vs. ERR/WLM=0.007 for short-term ex- and current smokers.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This resulted in a small decrease of the point estimate of the relative risk for current smokers compared to never smokers from RR=6.70 (unadjusted on radon exposure) to RR=6.41 (adjusted on radon exposure).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, the difference was statistically not significant.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Accordingly, a protective effect of smoking against radon induced LC was hypothesized and justified by thicker mucus layer and increased mucus velocities.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Contrary, calculated the local radiation dose due to inhaled radon progeny in bronchial target cells to be twice as high in heavy smokers compares to never smokers.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	"However, the apparent ""LC protection by smoking"" perhaps results from interaction in opposite direction of genes at chromosome 15q25.1 with smoking- respectively radon-induced LC"
0	NA	NA	rs8034191	DISCUSS	Furthermore, the risk of LC for homozygous carriers of the minor allele of two markers within 15q25.1 (rs8034191, rs1051730) was estimated as at least five-fold higher in subjects who had a familial history of LC.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We have discovered LC-risk stratification within this genomic region with respect to radon.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Thus the observed familial risk of the region 15q25.1 may in part be caused by a common environmental radon exposure, albeit at a lower level than the occupational exposure of former uranium miners
0	NA	UBE2U	NA	DISCUSS	The most significant gene-radon interaction outside suspected LC susceptibility regions was observed for UBE2U (1p21.3), a gene of the family of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes UBE2, also known as E2 enzymes.
0	death	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The coded enzyme performs a central step in the ubiquitination reaction that targets a protein for degradation, a major factor for life and death of proteins.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Protein ubiquitination is a pivotal regulatory reaction promoting the cellular responses to DNA damage.
0	NA	UBE2U	NA	DISCUSS	UBE2U was recently identified as a positive regulator of TP53BP1, which promotes the formation of ionizing radiation-induced foci and thereby chromatin responses at DSBs in human cell lines.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	E2 ligases are in general involved in multiple biological processes, for example UBE2T (1q32.1) promotes efficient DNA repair; UBE2B (5q31.1) is involved in UV mutagenesis, and UBE2N (12q22) is implicated in post-replication DNA repair following UV and ionizing radiations.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	UBE2N was associated with LC by a candidate gene approach (p=7x10-6).
0	NA	UBE2U	NA	DISCUSS	The strong involvement of the human E2 ubiquitin- and ubiquitin-like conjugating enzymes in DNA damage signalling and DNA-repair processes confirms mechanistically the plausibility for the observed gene-radon interaction of UBE2U resulting in an increased radiations sensitivity for individuals bearing this genetic make-up
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In a review of DNA repair and cancer risk recently stated that defects in DNA repair genes are the genetic events most commonly involved in hereditary cancers.

0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	DSBs, the most harmful lesions, are repaired by an intricate network of multiple DNA repair pathways; inter alia single-strand annealing (SSA), non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination (HR).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Seven of the 93 genes suspected to affect susceptibility to LC are DNA repair genes: BRCA2, CHEK2, GTF2H4, MSH5, PMS1, RAD52, XRCC4.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Only the first (HR and SSA), the second last (HR and SSA) and the last (NHEJ) belong to DSB repair pathways
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Because gene-radon interaction with a long-term occupational exposure to radon was investigated, we expected findings to be related to DNA repair, in particular DSB.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	To our surprise we did not achieve cumulative significance overall on DNA-repair genes (GO:0006281, p=1.0), nor for DSB repair (GO:0006302, p=0.8340) or SSB repair (GO:0000012, p=0.9204).
0	NA	GSA	NA	DISCUSS	This missing significance may be attributed to the nature of the applied test in the GSA.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The power for broadly defined gene sets of interest is low, because these contain too many not associated genes.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	For the more specifically defined pathway SSA of DSB repair we achieved a stronger, albeit not significant signal for association (GO:0045002, p=0.1574).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Local significance was achieved for genes involved in DNA dealkylation involved in DNA repair (G0:0006307, p=0.0139), a reaction to DNA damage caused by free radicals and other reactive species generated by metabolism which results in alkylated bases.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Ionizing radiation induces this type of DNA damage by indirect radiation reactions through the induction of ROS.

0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The most informative subsample consists of only 463 former uranium miners but with carefully determined occupational exposure to radon.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	To have enough power for the genome-wide analysis, we had to include such a large amount of controls.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This should be seen as a necessity rather than a disadvantage, given the small available sample of occupational radon-exposed lung cancer cases.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We were further forced to make some assumptions, e.g.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	no participant of a TRICL/ILCCO study was substantial long-term exposed to radon (WLM < 50) However, even long-term but low-dose exposure to radon, occupational as well as residential, was previously associated with a small increase in lung cancer risk.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Thus, the small risk of misclassifying few of the many participants of a TRICL/ILCCO study is more likely for cases than for controls.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Hence the allocation made is conservative in terms of statistical testing
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We also needed to fix the marginal odds ratio for radon exposure to the value observed within the miners.
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Subgroup analysis by histological cancer type could not be performed owing to the small number of exposed cases, in particular those with reliable records
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The risk of confounding effect due to smoking on radon-associated risk for lung cancer was previously investigated in a case-control study nested in the cohort of German uranium miners.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The estimation of radon-related lung cancer risks was robust against model fitting with and without smoking.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Consequently, smoking does not act as a major confounder.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Potential confounding due to other mining related exposures was also examined within the German uranium miners cohort.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The correlation between measured radon exposure with external gamma radiation, long-lived radionuclides or arsenic was low; the correlation with fine dust or silica dust was moderate.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The influence of adjustment for these potential confounders on the exposure-response relationship was only modest.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Hence major confounding by these other occupational risk factors can be excluded
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The reported study was restricted to Caucasian populations to minimize population stratification.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Although the miners came from a small area in the middle of Germany, no differing genetic background compared to the TRICL/ILCCO samples from Russia to Hawaii was found.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The results may not be generalized to other ethnicities because of different genetic background.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	It should also be noted that within the small sample of miners, controls are long-term survivors with a disproportionally high sampling of high radon exposed subjects.
