0	prostate carcinogenesis	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	The findings provide insight into the genetic contribution of common variants to lung carcinogenesis
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	To date, several large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of lung cancer conducted in subjects of European background have identified susceptibility alleles on chromosomes 5p15.33, 6p21.33 and 15q25.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	These studies have shown that statistical evidence that exceeds the threshold of genome wide significance, defined as a p value less than 5x10-7  or 1x10-8 .
0	prostate carcinogenesis	NA	NA	INTRO	In each study, the majority of cases and controls were cigarette smokers, making it difficult to determine whether these loci are associated with lung carcinogenesis or tobacco use, or perhaps both.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	It has been difficult to accrue a sufficiently large set of lung cancer cases with no history of smoking because a high proportion of lung cancer in women as well as men in North America and Europe is directly related to tobacco use.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	In contrast, a substantial proportion of lung cancer in East Asian women occurs among non-smokers, who interestingly have a relatively high rate of lung cancer.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	This suggests that genetic and/or environmental factors could account for the observed differences.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	To investigate this further, we conducted a genome-wide association study with follow-up of notable SNPs in never-smoking women in East Asia.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In addition, we genotyped tag SNPs optimized for East Asians for the three regions previously identified by GWAS in European populations
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	RESULTS	We conducted an initial GWAS of 584 lung cancer cases and 585 controls drawn from a case-control study in Taiwan, the Genetic Epidemiological Study of Lung Adenocarcinoma (GELAC) (Table 1).
0	lung adenocarcinomas	NA	NA	RESULTS	Cases were restricted to those never-smoking females with a confirmed diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the lung in GELAC.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Controls were drawn from never-smoking female controls in GELAC and frequency-matched by age with cases (see Text S1 for more details).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We began with a pilot study in which 54 cases and 54 controls were genotyped with the Illumina HumanCNV370-Duo BeadChip and, based on its success, 550 cases and 549 controls were genotyped on the Illumina HumanHap 610 Quad BeadChip.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	After quality control metrics were applied to both data sets (see Materials and Methods), the variance inflation factor lambda in the genomic control model was found to be 1.013 and the inflation factor lambda1000 for an equivalent study of 1000 cases and controls was 1.022; together with the comparison of the observed and expected p-values in the quantile-quantile plot, shown in Figure 1, there is no evidence of a substantial issue related to population substructure but instead, several promising regions in the tail of the distribution are apparent, suitable for follow-up analysis.

0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our study is notable because the sample size for never-smoking female cases is substantially larger than previous reports.
1	lung adenocarcinomas	NA	rs2736100	DISCUSS	Moreover, the estimated effect size observed for rs2736100 and adenocarcinoma of the lung (OR = 1.54) is greater than the associations previously reported in European populations (e.g., OR = 1.24 from the largest meta-analysis reported to date, p = 0.000046 for difference).
0	prostate carcinogenesis	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our study provides strong evidence that this locus on chromosome 5p15.33 is directly related to lung carcinogenesis because it has been conclusively shown in non-smoking women
1	cancers	NA	rs2736100	DISCUSS	The SNP marker, rs2736100, is mapped to a region of chromosome 5p15.33 in which common and rare genetic variants have been linked to a spectrum of cancers and related conditions.
1	NA	TERT	rs2736100	DISCUSS	rs2736100 is localized to intron 2 of the telomerase gene TERT, a reverse transcriptase that is critical for telomere replication and stabilization by controlling telomere length.
1	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Variants in the TERT-CLPTM1L locus have been identified by GWAS to harbor susceptibility alleles for cancer of the brain, pancreas and lung.
0	NSCLC-adenocarcinoma	NA	NA	DISCUSS	For the latter, a large meta-analysis combined with a new scan indicates that the signal in this locus is most strongly associated with one histology, adenocarcinoma in studies of European subjects
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	There is further evidence for association of this locus with additional cancers, though the reported results have not yet achieved the genome-wide association threshold; these include cancer of the bladder, prostate, uterine cervix, and skin including basal cell carcinoma and melanoma.
1	acute myelogenous leukemia	TERT	NA	DISCUSS	Rare variations/mutations in the TERT gene have been described as a risk factor for acute myelogenous leukemia and also explain a proportion of the inherited bone marrow failure family pedigrees with dyskeratosis congenita, a cancer predisposition syndrome.
1	idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis	TERT	NA	DISCUSS	Mutations in the TERT gene have also been described in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
1	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Together these findings suggest that the TERT-CLPTM1L 5p15.33 region could be important in the development of a spectrum of cancers.
1	NA	NA	rs2736100	DISCUSS	Still, at this time, further studies are needed to fine map the region, based on comprehensive re-sequence analysis in East Asian populations, to narrow the set of genetic variants worthy of functional studies to establish the mechanism underpinning the association marked by the SNP rs2736100 and subsequently compare these findings with comparable analyses in the other diseases
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The plausible mechanisms underlying the association signals across this region of chromosome 5p15.33 are currently under active investigation by many groups.
0	prostate carcinogenesis	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our findings are particularly interesting because we have identified variants that appear to be directly related to primary carcinogenesis.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In this regard, it is critical that future studies evaluate environmental risk factors that may contribute, particularly since there is preliminary data suggesting that smoking as well as other exposures could directly influence telomere lengths.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	It is noteworthy that lung cancer risk among non-smoking women in East Asia has been linked to indoor air pollution from environmental tobacco smoke, fumes produced by high temperature cooking, and coal combustion products

0	prostate carcinogenesis	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We observed estimated effect sizes that are substantially higher than those previously reported in European smokers, which bears follow-up investigation into the biology of the underlying mechanism of the contribution of this region to primary lung carcinogenesis.
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Since this region on chromosome 5p15.33 has been implicated in many cancers, our observations should stimulate further investigation of the region that could lead to new insights into carcinogenesis
