0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	AD with onset age after 65 years is highly heritable with an estimated 74% of the liability explained by genetic factors.
0	Alzheimer's disease	apolipoprotein E	NA	INTRO	A major genetic risk factor for AD is APOE genotype which accounts for approximately 35% of the genetic variance.
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	rs429358	INTRO	The three common APOE alleles (epsilon2, epsilon3 and epsilon4) are determined by combinations of polymorphic amino acid residues at Arg112 (rs429358) and Cys158 (rs7412).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Among non-Hispanic whites of European Ancestry (EA), epsilon4 heterozygotes have a 2.5 to 3.0 fold increased risk and epsilon4 homozygotes have a 10-12 fold increased risk, compared to persons with the epsilon3/epsilon3 genotype.

0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	INTRO	For example, the effect of the APOE epsilon4 allele is much greater in Japanese and substantially weaker in African American and some Hispanic groups, due in part to varying frequencies of this allele across populations.
0	Alzheimer's disease	sortilin-related receptor L(DLR class A) repeats-containing	NA	INTRO	Three loci (SORL1, ABCA7, and ACE) whose association with AD attained genome-wide significance in EAs were found to have larger effects on AD risk in African Americans, (ABCA7), Japanese (SORL1), and Israeli-Arabs (ACE).

0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	METHODS	Details of subject recruitment and genotyping for individual case-control and family-based datasets, genotype imputation, quality control, population substructure, and statistical methods for association analyses were reported previously for Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC) datasets containing EAs, African Americans (AA), Japanese (JPN), and Israeli-Arab (IA).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Characteristics of the 33,269 ADGC subjects (26,320 EA, 4,983 AA, 1,845 JPN, and 115 IA) used for discovery in Stage 1 were shown in Supplementary Table 1.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	METHODS	Summarized results archived in the NIA Genetics of Alzheimer's Disease Data Storage Site (https://www.niagads.org/) that are from a previous GWAS of EAs conducted by the International Genomics Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) including 5,813 AD cases and 20,474 controls after excluding the ADGC datasets were used in Stage 2 follow-up analyses (Supplementary Table 1)

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The corresponding ranges for AAs and JPN are 1.40-2.69 and 1.74-3.78, respectively.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	GRRs of <5 are not detectable with 80% power in the small IA sample.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	However, the goal of this study was not for novel discovery within ethnic groups but rather in the total transethnic sample.
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	METHODS	Prompted by findings of previous studies, we also conducted separate GWAS in subgroups of subjects who have or lack an APOE epsilon4 allele.
0	Alzheimer's disease	apolipoprotein E	NA	METHODS	We also applied a complementary approach for assessing a differential effect of association by APOE genotype by evaluating association of AD with an interaction of SNP and epsilon4 status
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	METHODS	Within each dataset, genome-wide association analyses were conducted using more than 7 million imputed SNPs in the total sample, as well as in subgroups of subjects with and without the APOE epsilon4 allele, using regression models including age, sex, the first three PCs.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	An additive effect of a SNP was included in the model as a quantitative estimate between 0 and 2 representing the probability score of the effect allele to incorporate the uncertainty of the imputation estimates.

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Results for each model across datasets were combined by meta-analysis separately within each ethnic group using a fixed-effects, inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis in the METAL program.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	SNPs with a minor allele frequency >=1% and imputation quality>=0.4 that were available in at least 50% of the datasets were included in the meta-analysis.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The meta-analysis P-value for association was estimated by the summarized test statistic, after applying genomic control within each individual study.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Meta-analysis was also conducted using Han and Eskin's modified random effects model (RE-HE) that is optimized to detect associations under effect heterogeneity, as implemented in METASOFT.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	This model has similar power to the fixed effects model when heterogeneity is modest, e.g., when the standard deviation of the different ethnicities log odds ratios is <=0.5 times the mean log odds ratio, but has better power than the fixed effects model for substantial heterogeneity.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Thus, we do not expect the RE-HE model to produce substantially different results from the fixed effects model unless substantial heterogeneity among ethnicities exists
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We conducted genome-wide gene-based tests using ethnic-specific association results from SNP-based tests.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Intragenic SNPs and SNPs within 30 kilobases (kb) of transcription start and stop sites were included in each gene-based test.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We used the GATES method, which computes a gene-based P-value using SNP-based p values and SNP-SNP correlations by penalizing lack of association in correlated SNPs.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Ethnic-specific gene-based results for EA, AA, JPN, and IA groups were combined using the sample-size weighted Z-score method in METAL assuming the same direction of effect

1	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The transethnic approach applied here identified three novel loci (BZRAP1-AS1, NFIC, and TPBG) and GWS association for the first time with two other loci (PFDN1/HBEGF and USP6NL/ECHDC3) noting that the size of the discovery sample in this study was less than 45% of the one included in a previous GWAS that contained more than 74,000 EA subjects.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The improved power in our smaller sample can be ascribed to allele frequency differences and allelic heterogeneity among the ethnic groups.
1	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	As an example highlighting the importance of these differences, the top SNPs from BZRAP1-AS1 and NFIC had different minor allele frequencies across ethnic groups, but the effect sizes were similar and association signals were greater in fixed effect meta-analysis.

0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The novel GWS SNP associations were robust in analyses allowing for heterogeneity across different ethnic groups, and the P-values for the RE-HE approach were slightly larger than for the fixed effect model, suggesting that the effect size heterogeneity across the groups is modest
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our study also revealed that the effect direction for several SNPs vary across ethnic groups.
0	NA	NME8	NA	DISCUSS	For example, the top-ranked SNPs in NME8, ABCA7, and CASS4 (Supplementary Table 2) were nominally significant in EAs and AAs, but the referent allele was associated with increased risk in one group and decreased risk in the other.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	One explanation for these differences is that the SNPs are tagging different functional variants across groups.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This idea is consistent with our findings from gene-based tests showing that the constellation of variants contributing to the association with some genes was different across ethnic groups.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Alternatively, when examining a large number of variants it is expected that a few will show nominal significance in opposite directions among groups
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	There are several limitations associated with our study.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The sample size imbalance between the EAs and the other populations weakened the opportunity to identify association patterns that may be unique to the non-EA groups.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The small size of the non-EA groups also reduced power to detect novel gene associations if the functional variants (and the SNPs that tag them) differ among ethnic groups.
0	weakness	NA	NA	DISCUSS	An additional weakness is the lack of replication samples for the non-EA populations.
