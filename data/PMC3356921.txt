0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Alzheimer disease (AD) IS the most common form of dementia.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Environmental and host risk factors for common late-onset AD (LOAD) include low educational level, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and head trauma.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Genetic factors also influence LOAD risk, evidenced by heritability estimates as high as 75% and analyses showing transmission of a major gene for the disease in families.
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	INTRO	Until recently, the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE [OMIM +107741]) was the only one generally recognized to influence LOAD risk.
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	INTRO	In whites, homozygosity for the epsilon4 variant is associated with an increased risk by as much as 15 times that of the most common APOE genotype (epsilon3/epsilon3)
1	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	INTRO	Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have reported genome-wide significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across a 70-kilobase (kb) region that includes APOE and several neighboring genes, namely, poliovirus receptor-related 2 (PVRL2 [OMIM *600798]), translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 40 yeast homologue (TOMM40 [OMIM *608061]), and apolipoprotein C-I (APOC1 [OMIM *107710]).
0	Alzheimer's disease	TOMM40	NA	INTRO	Both the TOMM40 and APOC1 genes have been considered possible risk factors for AD independent of APOE.
0	Alzheimer's disease	TOMM40	NA	INTRO	Several lines of inquiry have implicated TOMM40 as having an effect on AD risk, including evidence of a role of mitochondria in AD pathogeneisis, association of an intronic TOMM40 repeat polymorphism with age at the onset of AD symptoms among subjects lacking the epsilon4 allele, and association of a haplotype spanning TOMM40 with expression of APOE.
0	NA	TOMM40	NA	INTRO	However, other studies did not find an effect of TOMM40 after adjusting for APOE.
0	Alzheimer's disease	APOC1	NA	INTRO	A polymorphism immediately upstream of the APOC1 gene has also been proposed as a possible risk locus for AD.
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	INTRO	This polymorphism is in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the APOE risk locus, but this pattern varies substantially by population.
0	NA	APOC1	NA	INTRO	Studies in mice and humans indicate that APOC1 expression has an effect on memory.
0	Alzheimer's disease	APOC1	NA	INTRO	Other studies reported that APOC1 modifies the risk of AD independent of or through interaction with APOE
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	INTRO	The GWASs conducted by several large consortia have identified robust evidence of an association with genes outside the APOE region, including clusterin (CLU [OMIM *185430]), phosphatidylinositol-binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM [OMIM *603025]), complement component (3b/4b) receptor 1 (CR1 [OMIM *120620]), bridging integrator 1 (BIN1 [OMIM *601248]), CD2-associated protein (CD2AP [OMIM *604241]), ephrin type-A receptor 1 (EPHA1 [OMIM *179610]), the membrane-spanning 4A (MS4A) gene cluster, myeloid-associated antigen CD33 (CD33 [OMIM *159590]), and ATP-binding cassette, subfamily A (ABC1), member 7 (ABCA7 [OMIM *605414]).
0	NA	CLU	NA	INTRO	Findings with CLU, PICALM, CR1, and ABCA7 have been replicated
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Because there are population differences in LD and allele frequencies, most association studies have focused on a single population to decrease genetic background noise and reduce the likelihood of false-positive findings due to confounding.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Thus, confirmation in other populations is required to determine the generalizability of the contribution of each gene to AD risk and the possibility of population-specific causative variants.
0	Alzheimer's disease	apolipoprotein E	NA	INTRO	Although the effect of APOE has been investigated extensively in multiple populations, few African American cohorts have been included in GWASs for AD
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In the present study, we genotyped more than 1000 African American cases and controls for more than 600 000 SNPs covering the entire genome.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Genotypes for 2.5 million SNPs imputed from HapMap reference panels were used to investigate the contribution of genes previously implicated in whites to AD risk and to identify novel AD risk variants in this population.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	We also analyzed a comparable set of SNPs in 5 white AD GWAS data sets containing more than 9700 subjects to replicate novel findings and for comparison with previously obtained results

0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	In the African American cohort, the epsilon4 allele is very significantly associated with AD (P=9.69x10-23).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Analysis of individual genotypes showed evidence of a significant protective effect of epsilon2 (epsilon2/epsilon2 and epsilon2/epsilon3 genotypes) compared with the epsilon3/epsilon3 genotype and an exponential increase in risk associated with the dose of epsilon4 (Table 3).

0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This is, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive genetic association study of AD in African Americans.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This study is timely and important for several reasons.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	African Americans are about twice as likely as non-Hispanic whites to have AD.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Although differences in AD etiology across populations have been widely studied, they are still poorly understood.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The occurrence of multiple demented individuals in African American families is significantly higher than in white families, although the genetic risk of AD is similar in these 2 populations.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The increased familial risk in African Americans is likely a result of higher rates of risk factors, such as poor education, diabetes mellitus, and smoking.
0	cognitive defects	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, comparisons of risk in African American and white cohorts are complicated by differences in assessment of cognitive decline across studies and by population differences in willingness to participate in medical research
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	DISCUSS	We obtained incontrovertible evidence of an association with the APOE epsilon4 allele, thus confirming findings from several smaller genetic studies of African Americans.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In non-Hispanic whites, homozygosity for epsilon4 is associated with a 13- to 15-fold increased odds of developing AD compared with those with the most common genotype, epsilon3/epsilon3.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We showed previously in a set of 308 African American AD cases and 409 ethnically matched controls that persons with the epsilon3/epsilon4 and epsilon4/epsilon4 genotypes had 2.6- and 10.5-fold increased odds of AD, respectively, compared with persons with the epsilon3/epsilon3 genotype.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	These risks decreased substantially after 68 years of age.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The risk of AD was lower among individuals with the epsilon2/epsilon3 genotype.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We observed similar risks in the present study.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Approximately one-third of the African American sample in this study overlaps with the sample in our earlier report
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	DISCUSS	Our present study and previous studies in white populations identified highly significant evidence of an association with genes adjacent to APOE, most notably TOMM40 and APOC1 (reviewed by Ertekin-Taner).
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	DISCUSS	Arguably, the distinction of such findings from confounding with APOE is intractable because of the tight LD spanning the genes in this region.
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	DISCUSS	However, we identified highly significant evidence of an association with several SNPs in the APOE region in African Americans and whites after adjustment for APOE genotype.
0	Alzheimer's disease	apolipoprotein E	NA	DISCUSS	This finding is consistent with an AD risk locus distinct from APOE.
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	DISCUSS	The observation that different SNPs in this region are significant in African Americans and whites after adjustment for APOE may reflect differences in LD structure in this region (Figure 2).
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	DISCUSS	The residual association in these other genes may also represent unmeasured effects of variants in regulatory regions of APOE.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Additional studies in larger African American samples are needed to determine which of these explanations is more likely
0	Alzheimer's disease	MIRAGE	NA	DISCUSS	Among the African Americans in the present study, a subset of 180 cases and 200 controls from the MIRAGE Study and 221 cases and 186 controls from the GenerAAtions Study was included in another recent study that evaluated the association of AD with PICALM, CLU, and CR1 SNPs highlighted in the original studies reports.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The authors did not find evidence of an association with any of the SNPs examined in the African American data sets.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We did not replicate the genome-wide significant associations with these loci in a larger set of African American cases and controls, even at a nominal significance level.
0	NA	CR1	NA	DISCUSS	However, we observed an association in African Americans with other previously unreported variants in each of these regions and in the most recently reported regions of genome-wide significant association, except CR1 and CD2AP.
0	NA	ABCA7	rs3764650	DISCUSS	Only one previously reported genome-wide significant association (rs3764650 in ABCA7) was confirmed in our African American sample.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Discordance in the association patterns between whites and African Americans could be related to population differences in allele frequencies or LD patterns.
0	NA	PICALM	rs17148827	DISCUSS	This explanation is consistent with our findings of association in the African Americans between SNPs, which have very low frequency in whites (eg, rs17148827 in PICALM), and one of the previously reported AD-associated CLU SNPs (rs2279590), but with an opposite pattern of effect.
0	Alzheimer's disease	sortilin-related receptor L(DLR class A) repeats-containing	NA	DISCUSS	Alternatively, the AD risk variants in these genes may differ across populations (ie, allelic heterogeneity), as we observed previously in SORL1.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, lack of replication might also be a result of small sample size when compared with recent consortium-based GWASs.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In most instances, the confidence intervals for the effect estimates in African Americans included the point estimates in whites
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Analysis of the entire autosomal genome revealed evidence suggestive of an association with several novel candidate genes that may play a role in AD pathogenesis.
0	NA	PROX1	NA	DISCUSS	PROX1 (OMIM *601546) is a prospero-related transcription factor that plays a critical role in the development of various organs, including the mammalian lymphatic and central nervous systems.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This transcription factor has recently been shown to play a key role in adult neurogenesis, suggesting it may be involved in memory development.
0	autism and language disorders	contactin-associated protein-like 2	NA	DISCUSS	The contactin-associated protein-like 2 gene (CNTNAP2 [OMIM *604569]) is involved in brain development and has been implicated in susceptibility to autism and language disorders.
0	NA	CNTN5	NA	DISCUSS	In 2009, Harold et al reported a SNP in the contactin gene, CNTN5 (OMIM *607219), to have a GWAS P value of 2x10-5.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Subsequently, the same SNP was shown to be associated with a variety of magnetic resonance imaging measures in the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort.
0	NA	 kinase 24	NA	DISCUSS	Serine/threonine kinase 24 (STK24 [OMIM *604984]) is expressed in the brain.
0	NA	 kinase 24	NA	DISCUSS	An isoform of STK24 has been shown to be a regulator of axon growth and axon regeneration after injury.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, we did not observe association in these regions in a meta-analysis of a replication sample of 5 white AD data sets containing 3568 cases and 6205 controls.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	A study of a larger independent sample of African American and possibly white samples will be needed to determine whether these associations are spurious or reflect population-specific variants or variable LD patterns among populations
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This study represents an important step in elucidating the genetic basis of AD in African Americans.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our results suggest that African Americans share some but not all AD genetic risk factors with whites.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Further research would not only lead to a more accurate understanding of the genetic risk factors that could be incorporated in diagnostic and predictive testing protocols specific for African Americans but may also yield new gene discovery and clues for subsequent interventions useful to all populations at risk for AD
