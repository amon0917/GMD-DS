0	Type 2 diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disease with a complex pathogenesis defined by genetic predisposition and environmental factors.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In Lebanon, T2DM was evaluated on 8,050 Lebanese cases in 1990.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Its prevalence and incidence, similar to the international averages, were 5.0% and 1.5 to 1.7% respectively.
0	glucose homeostasis	NA	NA	INTRO	In 1992, a study on 436 cases from all over the Lebanese territory gave prevalence of 7 to 8% for T2DM and 10 to 11% for impaired glucose tolerance.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In 2005, a study on 3,000 exclusively Lebanese individuals from Greater Beirut showed a prevalence of 11.3% which increased with older age.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The combined prevalence of previously and newly diagnosed T2DM was 15.8%.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	At that time, in the U.S., 6.3% of the population had T2DM: 4.5% diagnosed and 1.8% undiagnosed according to the 2004 National Diabetes Fact Sheet.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	These results suggest that the prevalence of T2DM in Greater Beirut is relatively high and is increasing among the Lebanese population
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	Furthermore, according to the latest figures in the American National Diabetes Statistics Report, 29.1 million children and adults in the United States have diabetes, and 86 million people have prediabetes.
0	hypertension	NA	NA	INTRO	The pathogenesis of T2DM is closely associated with a positive family history, male gender, age over 45 years, overweight, hypertension, and abnormal lipid levels.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In addition, the genetic contribution to T2DM is well recognized with a total of 91 established associated susceptibility loci.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The common variants in the reported loci however account for only a small proportion of the heritability of T2DM and the functional role of most of these variants remains far from clear.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	It is possible that a large number of highly-penetrant but rare T2DM susceptibility genetic variants remain to be identified.
0	genetic diseases	NA	NA	INTRO	Additional genome-wide explorations including whole genome and exome sequencing in well-established groups of patients and controls may unravel these additional important genetic disease contributors which will undoubtedly help us understand the complex mechanisms involved in the development of T2DM
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The prevalence of T2DM is distinctly variable across populations and this variability adds to the disease complexity.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	This variability could be due to differences in lifestyle factors such as dietary habits, as well as behavioral patterns among populations.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Multiple established T2DM susceptibility genetic loci have been identified from previous Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) in populations of European and Asian ethnicities.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	It is however, equally important to replicate the behavior of these previously discovered associated variants in ethnically different populations and to identify novel predisposing genetic factors that may be stronger in their association than in previously studied populations
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	To identify T2DM susceptibility loci in the Lebanese population, we performed a GWAS of more than 5,000,000 SNPs, which were directly genotyped or imputed using the 1000 Genomes Project reference panels.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Our study enrolled 1,388 patients and 1,902 non-diabetic subjects with detailed cross-sectional demographic and clinical information.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Previously, targeted T2DM susceptibility SNP replication studies have been conducted in the Lebanese population.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	However, this study seeks to establish a baseline association for T2DM in the Lebanese population and thus it is the first genome-wide scan to find genomic regions implicated in T2DM.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	We also make use of recent reference data from the 1000 Genomes Project, which was previously shown to identify novel and refined associations for type 2 diabetes mellitus
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The study population has a mean age of 62.9 (+-11.1) (Table 1).

0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	37995922 sites were imputed.
0	NA	MAF	NA	RESULTS	The final set included 5891794 SNPs kept after QC (MAF > 0.05, AIMs removal).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The accuracy of the genotype imputation depends on the array SNP coverage and the similarity of haplotypes between the study dataset and the reference panels.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The Lebanese population was previously shown to be genetically very close to Europeans that are well represented in the 1000 Genomes Project references.

1	NA	CDKAL1	NA	RESULTS	Adjustment for sex, age, and BMI (Table 2) identified 16 additional genome-wide significant variants in CDKAL1 and TCF7L2 (Transcription factor 7-like 2) and showed that association of these two loci with T2DM appear to be independent from age and BMI.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	These variants are also added to Table S1 along with imputation scores
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The genomic control inflation factor (lambda) which compares observed association statistics against the expected distribution, was 1.073 suggesting possible but marginal over-dispersion of the association statistics (Figure 4)
0	NA	ROR2	NA	RESULTS	SNPs of interest that showed trend of association but did not reach genome-wide significance were 12 variants on chromosome 9 (Supplementary Table 1), overlapping a region with microRNA 3910-1 and 3910-2 downstream the gene ROR2 (receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 2)
1	NA	NA	rs7766070	RESULTS	Three of the SNPs, rs7766070, rs9368222, and rs34872471, identified in Table 2 were significant in DIAGRAM consortium.

0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Lebanon represents a Levantine region with higher European affinity than other parts of the Middle East, and therefore potentially fills in the map between SNPs identified in European populations contrasted with other Middle Eastern populations.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Further, since T2DM is an emerging issue within the Middle East, these populations may differentially highlight some variants distinct from other regions.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Even accepting relatively low power compared to that available in meta-studies, the moderately small number of replicated GWS significant SNPs in our study is less than expected, especially given the affinity of Lebanon with other European populations
