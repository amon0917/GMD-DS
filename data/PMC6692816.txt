0	likely peripheral neuropathy	NA	NA	INTRO	Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN):the most common cause of neuropathy worldwide:is a frequent complication of diabetes that significantly contributes to the increased morbidity and mortality associated with this disease.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	Up to one-fourth of the annual U.S. expenditure on diabetes is due to DPN, a large proportion of which is secondary to type 2 diabetes (T2D).
0	polyneuropathy	NA	NA	INTRO	The most common presentation of DPN is a distal symmetric polyneuropathy resulting from small and large fiber dysfunction leading to loss of sensory, proprioception, temperature, and pain discrimination, along with symptoms of numbness, tingling, burning, and shooting pain.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Signs and symptoms begin distally and spread proximally
0	hyperglycemia	NA	NA	INTRO	Known risk factors for DPN include duration and severity of hyperglycemia, age, dyslipidemia, hypertension, obesity, height, and smoking.
0	diabetic complications	NA	NA	INTRO	Because these exposures fail to fully explain interindividual differences in the risk of developing DPN, genetic factors have been postulated to be involved in the etiology of DPN, although formal heritability estimates, such as those available for other diabetic complications, including cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (narrow-sense heritability up to 39%), are not available for DPN.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	Knowledge of the genetic factors that modulate DPN risk may provide insights into the molecular pathways linking the diabetic milieu to nerve damage, which may in turn suggest new pharmacological targets for preventing or treating DPN.
0	diabetic complications	NA	NA	INTRO	However, although many genetic studies have been performed for other diabetic complications, data on the genetic determinants of DPN are scant.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	A few candidate gene studies have been performed, but these were small and not followed by replication attempts.
0	pain	NA	NA	INTRO	A locus on chromosome 8p21.3 was recently found to be associated with painful DPN in a genome-wide association study (GWAS), but this finding did not reach genome-wide significance and is still to be replicated
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	Here we report the results of a GWAS for DPN conducted among participants with T2D in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) clinical trial.
0	diabetes	SCN2A	NA	INTRO	Our findings, which were replicated in the population of the Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation 2 Diabetes (BARI 2D) trial, point to a locus on chromosome 2q24 as a powerful determinant of DPN risk that may act by affecting a nearby voltage-gated sodium channel, NaV1.2, expressed in peripheral nerves.

0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	No interaction was found with the intervention tested in ACCORD (i.e., intensive vs. standard glycemic control, intensive vs. standard blood pressure control, and fenofibrate vs. placebo) (Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	3).
0	loss of vibration perception	NA	NA	RESULTS	When the MNSI score components were analyzed individually, the strongest association was seen with alterations of foot appearance (OR 0.71, P = 2 x 10-7) and ankle jerk (OR 0.76, P = 2 x 10-5), followed by loss of vibration perception (OR 0.88, P = 0.04), whereas no association could be observed with foot ulcer (OR 1.00, P = 0.99).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Nominally significant associations were observed between 2q24 locus and triglycerides, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and UACR at baseline (Supplementary Table 7).
0	diabetes	NA	rs13417783	RESULTS	As reported in the Type 2 Diabetes Knowledge Portal (http://www.type2diabetesgenetics.org), an association between triglycerides and the index SNP (rs13417783) as well as the other GWAS-significant SNPs in LD with it had been previously detected in the Genetics of Diabetes Audit and Research in Tayside Scotland (GoDARTS) study (P = 0.00011 for rs13417783).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	However, adjustment for this variable or for the other two associated with 2q24 (eGFR and UACR) did not attenuate the association of this locus with DPN (Supplementary Table 8).
0	diabetes	NA	NA	RESULTS	Similarly, adjustment for age and duration of diabetes, which showed significant differences between case subjects and control subjects, had no effect (Supplementary Table 8).
0	diabetes	NA	NA	RESULTS	In addition, the association between the 2q24 locus and DPN was unaffected (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.54-0.77) by selecting control subjects who had a longer duration of diabetes (longer than the median of 7 years), and was only modestly reduced (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.60-0.89) by selecting older control subjects (older than the median age of 61 years).
0	cardiac dysfunctions	NA	NA	RESULTS	No association was detected between the 2q24 locus and risk of cardiac autonomic neuropathy or risk of micro- and/or macrovascular complications (Supplementary Tables 9 and 10)

0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	None of the 28 SNPs at the 2q24 locus showing GWAS-significant association with DPN in whites were associated with DPN in African Americans from ACCORD (n = 1,345), as judged on the basis of a two-sided P < 0.05.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	However, 15 of these SNPs had two-sided P < 0.20, with effects going in the same direction as in whites (OR 0.75-0.85) (Supplementary Table 6).
0	NA	NA	rs16852735	RESULTS	The strongest association was observed with rs16852735 (OR 0.75, two-sided P = 0.069, one-sided P = 0.034), which in African Americans was not in LD (r2 = 0.02) with the top SNP in whites (rs13417783).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The number of African Americans in BARI 2D was too small for a meaningful analysis
0	NA	NA	rs13417783	RESULTS	On the basis of the findings with the common variants, five low-frequency variants (MAF 0.01-0.05), which were placed in the same LD block as the lead SNP (rs13417783) and had been genotyped in ACCORD, were tested for association with DPN among white participants.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	All five variants, which were in high LD with each other (r2 = 0.82-1.00), showed a significant association with DPN (P < 0.01, based on a Bonferroni adjustment for five comparisons) (Table 4).
0	NA	NA	rs13417783	RESULTS	This association was somewhat attenuated but remained significant after adjustment for rs13417783 (Table 4).
0	NA	NA	rs13417783	RESULTS	Conversely, adjustment for any of these low-frequency variants had minimal impact on the magnitude of the association between the common variant (rs13417783) and DPN (Table 4).
0	NA	NA	rs1509652	RESULTS	Two of these variants (rs1509652 and rs6755015) were genotyped in BARI 2D and did not show any association with DPN (OR 0.94 and OR 1.07, respectively, P > 0.05 for both), although power for the analysis of low-frequency variants was limited in this data set due to the smaller sample size
1	NA	SCN1A	NA	RESULTS	The common variants associated with DPN at 2q24 span 80 kb of noncoding sequence placed between a cluster of genes coding for NaVs (SCN1A, SCN2A, SCN3A, SCN7A, and SCN9A) on the centromeric side and XIRP2 (xin actin binding repeat containing 2) on the telomeric side (Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	2A).
0	NA	SCN2A	rs13417783	RESULTS	In an eQTL analysis of GTEx data concerning 16 genes placed in a 2-Mbp radius from the lead SNP, carriers of the rs13417783 minor allele had significantly higher tibial nerve expression of SCN2A, coding for NaValpha subunit 2, and AC019181.2 (LOC101929633), coding for an uncharacterized noncoding RNA (P = 9 x 10-4 and P = 6 x 10-4, respectively) (Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	2B-D).
1	NA	XIRP2	NA	RESULTS	A nominally significant association (P = 0.03) was also detected with lower expression of the immediately adjacent XIRP2 gene
0	NA	SCN2A	NA	RESULTS	To gain further insight into SCN2A gene expression in peripheral nerves, we contrasted SCN2A gene expression in the hippocampus (a central nervous system tissue, serving as a positive control), with dorsal root ganglion (DRG), which contains the cell bodies of the neurons supplying the axons to the sensory portion of the tibial nerve, tibial nerves, and skeletal muscle, an excitable nonnervous system tissue, serving as negative control.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Coding gene relative abundances (in TPMs) and their corresponding percentiles are provided for all four tissues in Table 5, which includes samples from both sexes.
0	NA	SCN2A	NA	RESULTS	Abundant RNA signal for SCN2A was found in both the hippocampus and in the DRG.
0	NA	SCN2A	NA	RESULTS	Although at lower levels, SCN2A was also consistently expressed (in all but one sample) in the tibial nerve.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	By contrast, it was undetectable in 80% of the samples of the skeletal muscle samples and, in the remaining 20% of the samples, was among the lowest in abundance across all tissues
0	NA	SCN2A	NA	TABLE	Relative SCN2A abundance (in TPM) and corresponding percentiles across coding gene
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Through a GWAS of the ACCORD cohort, we have identified a previously unrecognized locus on chromosome 2q24 having a powerful effect on the risk of DPN in T2D.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	An association of similar strength was found between this locus and DPN in BARI 2D.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In both cohorts, the 2q24 minor allele conferred protection from DPN, being more frequent in DPN-negative control subjects than in DPN case subjects and the general population.
0	NA	SCN2A	NA	DISCUSS	In further support of these findings, the same allele was found to be associated with higher tibial nerve expression of a nearby gene (SCN2A) coding for the alpha subunit of NaV1.2, providing a possible functional basis for the genetic effect observed at the population level.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This is the first report of a DPN locus that reaches genome-wide significance in a GWAS and is replicated in an independent study
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The fact that almost identical effects on DPN were found for this locus in the discovery (OR 0.63) and replication (OR 0.57) is remarkable and makes this finding especially robust.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Such a high degree of concordance reflects the use of the same DPN definition (clinical examination MNSI >2) in studies and the high sensitivity, specificity, and correlation with abnormal nerve conduction characteristic of this DPN outcome.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Other contributing factors include the similar clinical characteristics of the two cohorts with regard to height, BMI, diabetes duration, blood pressure, and smoking status, and the similar incidence of DPN, despite the administration of different interventions
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	There are scant data in the literature to which our findings can be compared because only one other GWAS of DPN has been published to date.
0	NA	GFRA2	NA	DISCUSS	That study, based on the GoDARTS data sets, found suggestive evidence (P = 1.8 x 10-7) for a DPN locus on chromosome 8p21 near GFRA2.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We could not replicate that finding in our study, and conversely, no significant evidence for the locus 2q24 that we identified in ACCORD and BARI 2D was reported in the GoDARTS study.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In addition to the possibility of the 8p21 locus being a false positive, given the lack of genome-wide significance and previous replication, there are important differences between the two GWASs that could explain these discrepancies.
0	pain	NA	NA	DISCUSS	First, the outcome considered by the GoDARTS study was painful DPN, defined as a prescription history of at least one of five drugs indicated for the treatment of neuropathic pain along with a positive monofilament test for sensory neuropathy, which is known to have low specificity.
0	pain	NA	NA	DISCUSS	By contrast, in our GWAS, DPN was defined by means of a validated instrument (MNSI clinical examination) that does not include pain in its assessment.
0	pain	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Thus, the two studies captured different aspects of DPN involving different components of the peripheral nervous system (predominantly small fibers in the case of painful DPN vs. large fibers in the case of MNSI-diagnosed DPN)
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Second, both ACCORD and BARI 2D were clinical trials, with close follow-up, standardized outcome acquisition by trained professionals, and strict adjudication, whereas the GoDARTS study was based on medical record data collected as part of routine medical care
0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Finally, ACCORD and BARI 2D participants were characterized by a long duration of diabetes (15 years on average by the end of the study), which helped minimize misclassification of control subjects:an essential feature for the identification of protective effects on DPN, such as that associated with the 2q24 locus.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Although diabetes duration was not specified in the GoDARTS report, it was likely to be shorter owing to the population-based nature of that cohort
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The DPN locus that we have identified may allow clinicians to focus prevention efforts on patients at higher risk of DPN.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, the real relevance of this finding lies in the great potential for improving our understanding of DPN biology and for identifying novel targets for preventive interventions.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	It is noteworthy in this regard that the newly identified DPN locus is located in close vicinity to a cluster of genes coding for the alpha subunits of NaVs, which are responsible for multiple aspects of neuron excitability, including thresholds for depolarizing responses and the amplitude of action potentials.
0	NA	SCN7A	NA	DISCUSS	From the most proximal to the most distal from the top variant, these genes include SCN7A, SCN9A, SCN1A, SCN2A, and SCN3A, which code for NaVx, NaV1.7, NaV1.1, NaV1.2, and NaV1.3, respectively.
0	diabetes	SCN2A	NA	DISCUSS	In the GTEx database, the protective allele of the 2q24 locus was significantly associated with higher expression of one of these genes (SCN2A) in the tibial nerve, supporting the hypothesis that increased activity of the corresponding NaV1.2, which is expressed in DRG and tibial nerve, may guard against the detrimental effects of the diabetic milieu on peripheral nerves.
0	NA	SCN2A	NA	DISCUSS	SCN2A mRNA is expressed by human and murine DRG neurons but not by Schwann cells or other cell types that are found in the tibial nerve (mousebrain.org), which suggests that the SCN2A mRNA in the tibial nerve is contributed by sensory nerve axons
0	Neurological and Communication Disorders	SCN2A	NA	DISCUSS	Rare mutations in the SCN2A gene have been implicated in the etiology of neurodevelopmental diseases such as autism spectrum disorder (loss of function mutations) and infantile seizures (gain of function mutations), but the effect of these variants on susceptibility to DPN has never been investigated due to the their rarity, nor has the effect of NaV1.2 loss or gain of function been studied in animal models of DPN.
0	NA	SCN3A	NA	DISCUSS	A relationship with DPN etiology has been instead clearly established for NaV1.3 and NaV1.7 (coded by SCN3A and SCN9A, respectively), but no differences in their expression were found among 2q24 genotypes in the GTEx database.
0	diabetes	SCN3A	NA	DISCUSS	Whether this was due to the small size and/or the lack of exposure to diabetes of the samples in the GTEx database, or is related to the fact that NaV1.3 and NaV 1.7 are preferentially expressed in small fibers mediating pain transmission, whereas the MNSI score mainly tests large fibers mediating vibration sense and tendon reflexes, remains to be determined
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Altogether, these findings highlight the need for further studies of the SCN genes in the 2q24 region as functional mediators of the DPN locus and potential targets of novel preventive interventions.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	These studies would include testing of the association between the 2q24 genotype and the expression of these genes in peripheral nerve samples specifically collected from subjects with diabetes, along with studies assessing the impact of overexpressing or knocking down these genes in peripheral nerves of animal models of DPN.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The noncoding gene AC019181.2 (LOC101929633), which also showed evidence of association with the 2q24 locus in the GTEx database, should be included in these studies given the potential role of noncoding RNAs as regulators of gene expression
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The genomic mechanisms linking this locus to differences in gene expression are unclear at this time.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The index SNP and the other 27 variants reaching GWAS significance are in a noncoding region with quite subtle epigenetic marks.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The index SNP was found by ENCODE to be located in a weak enhancer (as indicated by an H3K4m1 mark) in human embryonic stem cells, but whether this regulatory element is also active in neural cells remains to be determined.
0	NA	NA	rs12993796	DISCUSS	Of the other 27 SNPs, the 2 highest ranking in RegulomeDb are rs12993796 and rs16852735.
0	NA	BATF	NA	DISCUSS	The first SNP is located in a DNA segment that binds BATF (a transcription factor involved in the differentiation of immune cells) in a lymphoblastoid cell line (GM12878).
0	NA	RE1 silencing transcription factor	NA	DISCUSS	The second SNP is placed in a region showing evidence of binding to REST (RE1 silencing transcription factor) in a neuroectodermic cell line (PFSK-1).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	REST is a transcription factor that represses neuronal genes, including NaVs.
0	NA	SCN2A	rs16852735	DISCUSS	Because REST is expressed in peripheral nerves (as shown by GTEx data) and in DRG, one can speculate that the higher expression of SCN2A associated with the 2q24 protective allele in these tissues may be due to decreased binding of this repressor to the DNA segment where rs16852735 is located.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The other 25 SNPs showed minimal evidence of being functional in the summary provided by RegulomeDb.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Resequencing of the LD block in which the GWAS-significant SNPs are located in large series of case and control subjects, followed by ad hoc functional studies, will be necessary to identify the causal variant(s) and understand its (their) impact on genomic function
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Although the association with DPN was strongest at 2q24, another locus placed on chromosome 15q25 yielded notable GWAS significance in the ACCORD GWAS as well as in the meta-analysis with BARI 2D.
1	NA	NTRK3	NA	DISCUSS	Especially interesting is the vicinity of this locus to the NTRK3 gene coding for the receptor of neurotrophin 3, which, by prompting the extension of fibers from proprioceptive DRGs to the muscle spindle and the ventral horn of the spinal cord, is responsible for inducing the synaptic connection between sensory and motor neurons.
1	NA	NTRK3	NA	DISCUSS	On the basis of this evidence, this locus should be considered as a prime candidate for future studies, although the available GTEx data do not suggest an association between the index SNP at 15q25 and NTRK3 expression
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Strengths of our study include the advantages of clinical trials, such as the rigorous and standardized protocols for data acquisition, the regular follow-up, and access to rich phenotype data, as well as the systematic GWAS approach based on genotyped and imputed data of excellent quality and wide coverage.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	As discussed above, the use of a validation cohort having very similar clinical characteristics to the discovery cohort was another critical strength
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Nonetheless, some limitations should be acknowledged.
0	cardiovascular disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Because ACCORD and BARI 2D were both designed to include participants with T2D at high risk of cardiovascular disease, whether our findings could be generalized to individuals with different characteristics or with type 1 diabetes remains to be determined.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Similarly, our study was limited to white subjects, and it is not known whether these findings also apply to individuals of other races, although the limited data on African American individuals from ACCORD suggest that this might be the case.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Also, our study, while larger than most of the genetic studies of DPN published thus far, was powered to detect only relatively large genetic effects and the fact that control subjects were slightly younger and had slightly shorter diabetes duration than case subjects may have biased results toward the null hypothesis.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Therefore, other loci having smaller yet functionally relevant effects may have gone undetected.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Finally, because the GWAS was limited to common polymorphisms (MAFs >5%), the existence of additional genetic effects due to less frequent variants cannot be excluded
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In summary, we have identified and successfully validated a locus on chromosome 2q24 having a powerful protective effect on the development of DPN in T2D.
0	NA	SCN2A	NA	DISCUSS	Tissue expression analysis suggests that this effect may be mediated by higher expression of the NaV1.2 in the tibial nerve, which is known to increase neuronal excitability.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	These results may provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of DPN and point to a potential new target for interventions aimed at preventing or treating this complication of diabetes
