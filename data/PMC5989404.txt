0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that were formally recognized in 2001 as one of the largest classes of gene regulators in eukaryotes.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	miRNAs undergo a complex, multistep process of biogenesis summarized by Lin and Gregory in 2015.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Briefly, within the nucleus, a primary miRNA transcript (pri-miRNA):usually several hundred nucleotides (nt) to greater than 1 megabase (Mb) in length:is cleaved to create a precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) approximately 70 nt in length which folds to form a stem-loop intermediate.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	This intermediate is exported from the nucleus and further processed to a miRNA duplex, approximately 22 nt in length.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	One strand of the miRNA duplex is loaded onto the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to form a functional mature miRNA.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Cleavage and processing of the pri- and pre-miRNA require sequence and secondary structure recognition by several RNA-binding proteins and their partners.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Approximately 30% of mature miRNAs are processed from introns or exons of coding genes, while the remaining miRNAs are intergenic and expressed from independent transcription units.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Mature miRNAs bind to the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of target genes to silence them by either translational repression or messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	There are over 2500 identified human miRNAs and each may bind to hundreds or even thousands of different target genes, coordinating expression of a large number of mRNAs; this makes them key players in gene regulatory networks
0	cancers	NA	NA	INTRO	miRNAs have been shown to influence numerous molecular pathways and pathological conditions, including cancer, and can function as both oncogenes and tumor suppressors depending on the context.
0	cancers	MYC	NA	INTRO	Furthermore, oncoproteins such as MYC bind to the promoters of key miRNAs, activating oncogenic miRNAs (oncomiRs) and downregulating tumor suppressor miRNAs.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	In breast cancer (OMIM #114480), miRNAs have been implicated in the regulation of genes involved in pathways critically relevant to disease etiology and severity including apoptosis, cell cycle checkpoints, cell migration, invasion, and metastasis.
0	cancers	NA	NA	INTRO	To a large extent, the miRNA repertoire that is present in normal and paired tumor tissue from the same organ is quite similar; however, specific miRNAs are often aberrantly elevated or suppressed in the tumor.

0	cancers	NA	NA	INTRO	performed one of the first comprehensive characterizations via next-generation sequencing (NGS) of miRNAs in paired normal and tumor breast tissue and identified 361 new miRNAs.
0	invasive ductal carcinomas	NA	NA	INTRO	While the functionality of some of the miRNAs identified by deep sequencing remains unknown, about two-thirds of these newly identified miRNAs were expressed in other tissues, and nearly half were associated with components of the RISC and were found in estrogen receptor-positive, invasive breast ductal carcinoma cells.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Germline single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in critical regions of miRNA genes including the promoter and primary transcripts may contribute to the dysregulation in miRNA biogenesis and expression differences common in breast cancer
0	cancers	NA	NA	INTRO	Over the last decade there has been tremendous progress made in the field of miRNAs and cancer, particularly centered on miRNA expression patterns that are emerging as promising diagnostic tools and predictive markers because of their correlation with cancer progression and patient survival.
0	cancers	NA	NA	INTRO	However, little is known about the role of germline variation in miRNAs and susceptibility to cancer

0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Several epidemiological studies, including both admixture mapping and association analysis of the insulin-related pathway, have examined the 17q region for association with BC in AMBER.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	A recently published genome-wide case-only admixture scan using 2624 AIMs in the AMBER consortium identified a novel region of excess African ancestry associated with BC risk at 17q25.1 (confirmed in a case-control admixture analysis in the same consortium).
0	NA	NA	rs496948172	DISCUSS	In this admixture scan, AIM rs496948172 provided the largest Z score and marked a wide 17q25.1 region of approximately 4.6 Mb where Z scores remained above 3.7 indicating excess African ancestry associated with BC.
1	NA	NA	rs9913477	DISCUSS	Elevated Z scores of 2.4 for this case analysis extend into the 17q25.3 region, where the top hit for the current association analysis (rs9913477) is approximately 1 Mb from the top admixture hit (rs4969481), although LD between these variants is limited (D' = 0.19, r2 = 0.0009) based on AFR 1000 Genomes reference panel.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Thus, the region of excess African ancestry associated with BC marked by an AIM at 17q25.1 could include the more distal 17q25.3 region as well, providing evidence that variation in this genomic region associated with BC may contribute to disparity in risk.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	A second AMBER gene-based analysis of 184 genes in the insulin/insulin-like growth factor, leptin, and growth hormone pathways identified BAIP2 and CALM2, and AIAP2 and CSNK2A1 as the most significant gene associations (gene-based p <= 0.01) with both overall and ER positive BC, respectively.
0	NA	insulin	NA	DISCUSS	Thus, both admixture and insulin pathway-specific association analyses in AMBER provide suggestive evidence of an association with overall and ER-positive BC in the 17q21-25 region.
0	NA	insulin	NA	DISCUSS	However, due to the relatively less dense SNP set used to evaluate this genomic region in the admixture scan and the less granular nature of the gene-based insulin pathway analysis, neither identified the specific set of four miRNA-associated SNPs localizing a statistically significant association with BC reported here.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Additionally, each study strategy for multiple test correction varied in accordance with its statistical methods, with the admixture analysis using a more conservative Bonferroni correction, the gene-based method utilizing a gene-level correction factor, and our current study using a false discovery rate
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	A recently published epidemiological study examining miRNA genes and BC among women of African ancestry found fourteen miRNA SNPs associated with overall BC risk at the significance level of 0.05.
1	NA	MIR4739	rs73410309	DISCUSS	Included among these SNPs was rs73410309 within the precursor sequence of MIR4739 located on chromosome 17q25.3 (OR = 1.1; p = 0.039), which is approximately 1.5 Mb from our top hit in MIR3065 (rs9913477) and not in high LD with this SNP (D' = 0.007 and R2 = 0.0) based on AFR 1000 Genomes reference panel.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This study was restricted to SNPs within miRNA precursor and mature sequences and thus would not have included the SNP in the primary miRNA sequence identified in our study, but highlights the potential role for miRNA SNPs in BC risk among women of African ancestry in this genomic region
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	While no GWAS hits have been reported in the 17q25.3 region, this region has been implicated in several studies of BC tissues where recurrent gain of this genomic region is associated with subtype and recurrence.
0	breast cancer	BRCA1	NA	DISCUSS	Gene expression studies of 17q25.3 have identified significant overexpression of 17q25.3 genes in BRCA1 mutated triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) as compared with BRCA1 nonmutated TNBC, highlighting the important role that overexpressed sets of genes in this region may play in BC.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Given the major role that miRNAs play in global gene regulation it is possible that, even in the absence of a copy number gain, abnormal expression of miRNA genes intended to suppress expression across multiple oncogenes could lead to similar upregulation of sets of genes in this region with similar BC effect.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Studies of higher-order chromatin organization have identified regional epigenetic regulation (RER) in breast tumors and BC cell lines that are independent of copy number, where 26 regions of coordinate expression were identified between breast tumors and BC cell lines with nine RER showing upregulated gene expression relative to normal breast tissue.
0	NA	KCTD2	NA	DISCUSS	Included among these upregulated regions was a 0.9-Mb 17q25.1 region with correlated expression of KCTD2, GGA3, MRPS7, and GRB2, and a 0.58-Mb 17q25.3 region (approximately 900 kb from the four associated SNPs reported here) with correlated expression of STRA13, RFNG, CSNK1D, and SECTM1
0	NA	MIR3065	NA	DISCUSS	Perhaps the most compelling support implicating MIR3065 and BC comes from a recent study by Perrson et al.
0	breast cancer	MIR3065	NA	DISCUSS	in which NGS expression analysis in paired normal and breast tumor tissue demonstrates a strikingly disparate expression pattern for MIR3065.
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Among the 361 newly NGS identified miRNA precursors, tumor identity was defined by differences in expression level of a large and common set of miRNAs rather than tissue specific expression.
0	breast cancer	MIR3065	NA	DISCUSS	While tissue MIR3065 expression was highest in breast tumors in a panel of nine human tissues, both lung and placenta demonstrated the next highest expression levels.
0	NA	MIR3065	NA	DISCUSS	Similar to previous studies, through BAC array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), MIR3065 was also identified as a gene encoded in a region with high-level genomic amplification in luminal B, ERBB2/HER2-positive, ER positive, and ER negative subtypes.
0	breast cancer	MIR3065	NA	DISCUSS	Among TargetScan's (release 6.2, June 2012) MIR3065 gene top 15 predicted gene targets are the top hit AT-rich interaction domain 4B, ARID4B (alias BRCAA1, breast cancer antigen epitope-1) and RAB22A, a member of the RAS oncogene family of small GTPases involved in signal transduction.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Immunohistochemically, ARID4B/BRCAA1 was expressed in 65% of BC specimens but not in noncancerous tissues.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	and expression was closely associated with ER- and PR-positive status.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	BC patients also had significantly higher titers of this epitope than healthy donors (p < 0.001).
0	NA	MIR3065	NA	DISCUSS	Given that two of the top predicted targets are likely oncogenes, it is possible that the role of MIR3065 is to suppress expression of these oncogenes.
0	NA	MIR3065	NA	DISCUSS	It is also possible that the pri-MIR3065 SNP associated with BC (or a SNP in LD) impairs MIR3065 processing, leading to lower levels of mature MIR3065 and reduced inhibition of these oncogenes.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Of course, specific gene targets of this new miRNA are not yet fully known and new information may emerge as target prediction algorithms improve and functional data become available.
0	NA	MIR3065	NA	DISCUSS	For example, in addition to supporting the potential role of MIR3065 in BC, Perrson et al.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	also uncovered a new miRNA in a very well-studied region within the intron of ERBB2/HER2, a major predictive marker in BC.
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This discovery highlights the importance of evaluating genomic regulation beyond the protein coding gene level to examine the major role that noncoding genes, such as miRNAs, may play in cancer development and heterogeneity.
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	These insights will prove invaluable in our understanding of disease development, identifying at-risk populations and providing targets for cancer treatment
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Although this study was limited in scope to miRNAs with SNPs represented or imputed from the Illumina Human Exome BeadChip v1.1 and AMBER custom content (and thus only surveys one-third of all SNPS in the miRBase), as well as by miRNAs with predicted primary sequence from six cell lines, this study is one of the largest evaluations of miRNAs for association with BC.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Moreover, it is the largest investigation among African-American women with BC annotated for subtype.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Furthermore, predicted boundaries of primary transcripts at both 5' and 3' ends were extended from the start of the H3K4me3 peak at the 5' end (which is often upstream from the actual transcription start site (TSS)) and through the end of the H3K79me2 or H3K36me3 signal (which may or may not be downstream of the transcription termination site).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Thus, SNPs defined as retained within the primary transcript may reside just upstream in the miRNA promoter region or may reside just downstream beyond the 3' end of the primary transcript, thus potentially altering our interpretation of function.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Specifically, we predicted that the BC-associated SNPs identified may affect miRNA processing; however, if in fact they reside in the promoter regions, they may influence miRNA expression through other mechanisms.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	More experimental validation of discrete TSS and end sites is needed for the majority of known miRNAs.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Additionally, while this is one of the largest populations of African-Americans with BC examined for miRNA gene association, the subtype analyses remain underpowered for the genetic effect sizes anticipated
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Despite these limitations, this study provides valuable new information about the relationship between numerous miRNA genes and BC in an understudied population, African-American women.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	It emphasizes the complexity of SNP association analyses and interpretation of function in gene-dense regions, and also the complex interplay of evidence from studies of coding genes, copy number variation, epigenetic regulation, and admixture mapping in an important chromosomal region associated with BC.
1	NA	brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1-associated protein 2	NA	DISCUSS	Functional assessment of the BC-associated SNPs in BAIAP2 and MIR3065 are needed to identify the potential molecular mechanism behind their association with BC risk, in particular the risk of ER positive BC, the most common subtype.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Larger studies of African-American women are needed to address subtype-specific biology and genetics, including those related to miRNAs
0	NA	ER	NA	CONCL	This study reports a novel BC signal within an 8.6-kb locus on chromosome 17q25.3, where germline genetic variation is associated with overall and ER positive BC risk among African-American women.
1	NA	brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1-associated protein 2	NA	CONCL	This complex and gene-dense region contains BAIAP2, a protein-coding gene, and MIR3065, an important nonprotein coding regulatory gene, which may play key roles in BC development and heterogeneity among AA women.
0	NA	ER	NA	CONCL	An understanding of the potentially functional implications of variation in these genes is necessary and may uncover important genetic risk factors and mechanisms for BC in general and, more specifically, for ER positive BC, the most common subtype.
0	NA	NA	NA	CONCL	Understanding risk factors and mechanisms for BC may lead to improved screening, risk stratification, and novel treatments
