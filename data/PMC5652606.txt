0	Type 2 diabetes	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Type 2 diabetes (T2D) affects more than 415 million people worldwide, and its costs to the health care system continue to rise.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	To identify common or rare genetic variation with potential therapeutic implications for T2D, we analyzed and replicated genome-wide protein coding variation in a total of 8,227 individuals with T2D and 12,966 individuals without T2D of Latino descent.
0	NA	IGF2	NA	ABSTRACT	We identified a novel genetic variant in the IGF2 gene associated with ~20% reduced risk for T2D.
0	NA	IGF2	NA	ABSTRACT	This variant, which has an allele frequency of 17% in the Mexican population but is rare in Europe, prevents splicing between IGF2 exons 1 and 2.
0	NA	IGF2	NA	ABSTRACT	We show in vitro and in human liver and adipose tissue that the variant is associated with a specific, allele-dosage-dependent reduction in the expression of IGF2 isoform 2.
0	NA	IGF2	NA	ABSTRACT	In individuals who do not carry the protective allele, expression of IGF2 isoform 2 in adipose is positively correlated with both incidence of T2D and increased plasma glycated hemoglobin in individuals without T2D, providing support that the protective effects are mediated by reductions in IGF2 isoform 2.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Broad phenotypic examination of carriers of the protective variant revealed no association with other disease states or impaired reproductive health.
0	NA	IGF2	NA	ABSTRACT	These findings suggest that reducing IGF2 isoform 2 expression in relevant tissues has potential as a new therapeutic strategy for T2D, even beyond the Latin American population, with no major adverse effects on health or reproduction

0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	Uncovering the genetic contributors to diabetes holds promise for clinical impact by revealing new therapeutic targets aimed at the molecular and cellular mechanisms that lead to disease.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Genome-wide association studies performed during the past decade have uncovered more than 100 regions associated with T2D.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Although these studies have provided a better understanding of T2D genetics, the majority of identified variants fall outside protein-coding regions, leaving the molecular mechanism by which these variants confer altered disease risk obscure.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Consequently, T2D genome-wide association studies have identified few loci with clear therapeutic potential
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The identification of loss-of-function variants associated with reduced risk of disease is of particular interest, as their protective genetic effect can be potentially recapitulated by pharmacological inhibition.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Furthermore, if carriers of protective, loss-of-function variants are otherwise healthy, this suggests that specific pharmacological perturbation of the effector protein could confer benefit without significant adverse health effects

0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	This variant showed a stronger association with T2D when adjusting for population stratification using principal components, as the protective T allele was more frequent in individuals with higher Native American ancestry, which is also a risk factor for T2D.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Thus, we identified a protective genetic factor for T2D, present in 17% of a Latino population
0	NA	NA	rs149483638	RESULTS	We performed several analyses that suggest rs149483638 is the most likely causal variant for the protective signal.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	"First, we confirmed that other rare variants do not explain the association through a phenomenon called ""synthetic association"" (Supplementary Figs."

0	NA	KCNQ1	rs149483638	RESULTS	Second, we established that known T2D variants at the nearby KCNQ1 locus do not explain the association signal, as the two independently associated variants at the KCNQ1 locus are in weak linkage disequilibrium with rs149483638 in our data set, (r2 with rs139647931 = 0.026, r2 with rs2237897 = 0.028), and the T2D association with rs149483638 remains significant after conditioning for these two variants (OR = 0.81, P = 6.9 x 10-6).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Last, we carried out an analysis to identify the most likely causal variant(s).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	To do so, we first integrated whole-exome sequencing data, available for a subset of 3,732 samples, with exome chip and genotyping array data from OMNI2.5 and performed imputation with 1000 Genomes phase 3 reference panel in all the samples (Supplementary Figs.

0	diabetes	NA	rs149483638	RESULTS	We then sought to replicate the rs149483638 association in four independent data sets: T2D case and control subjects of Hispanic origin from the Type 2 Diabetes Genetic Exploration by Next-generation sequencing in multi-Ethnic Samples (T2D-GENES) Consortium (MAF = 0.12, OR = 0.89, P = 0.3), individuals of full-heritage American Indian ancestry from the Pima cohort (MAF = 0.14, OR = 0.68, P = 0.1 x 10-5), self-identified indigenous individuals from different ethnic groups in Mexico (DMS2 cohort) (MAF = 0.36, OR = 0.71, P = 0.001) (Supplementary Data), and a subsample of Hispanic individuals from the Genetic Epidemiology Research on Adult Health and Aging (GERA) cohort (MAF = 0.06, OR = 0.82, P = 0.11).

0	prediabetes	NA	NA	RESULTS	The direction of effect was consistent with the results in other data sets, but was not statistically significant (hazard ratio = 0.76, P = 0.24) (Supplementary Table 4), possibly because of lower power in this data set due to its smaller sample size and/or the inclusion of individuals with prediabetes who are at high risk for T2D at baseline.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	As an additional replication, and to further confirm that the findings are not due to potential population stratification, we analyzed this variant in the San Antonio Families studies, using a family-based association approach (N = 2,980); results are consistent with those obtained through the population-based analyses (z = -2.3, P = 0.02) (Supplementary Table 5).
