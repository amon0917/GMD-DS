0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Our results underscore the importance of international efforts combining GWAS datasets to isolate genetic loci for complex diseases
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative pathology afflicting humans.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	The prevalence of AD is rapidly growing due to a continuous increase in life expectancy in developed countries.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	AD is considered a complex neurodegenerative disorder that causes a progressive neuronal loss in the brain, resulting in a devastating cognitive phenotype, which ends with the death of the patient
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Although its etiology is poorly understood, genetic factors seem to play a pivotal role in AD.
0	Alzheimer's disease	beta-amyloid (Abeta)	NA	INTRO	In fact, three genes containing multiple full penetrance mutations, APP (amyloid precursor protein), PSEN1 (presenilin 1) and PSEN2 (presenilin 2), have been described for Mendelian AD.
0	Alzheimer's disease	apolipoprotein E	NA	INTRO	A non-necessary, non-sufficient common allele near the APOE (apolipoprotein E) transcript is almost universally associated with non-Mendelian AD.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	In spite of research efforts in AD genetics, until very recently no other genetic risk factor has been consistently associated with the AD phenotype.
1	Alzheimer's disease	CLU	NA	INTRO	However, recent advances in genome wide association study (GWAS) techniques have permitted the isolation of four uncontroversial meta-GWAS-significant (P < 5 x E-8) genetic markers associated with AD, which are located near the CLU (clusterin), PICALM (phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein), CR1 (complement component (3b/4b) receptor 1) and BIN1 (bridging integrator 1) genes.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	No other result derived from genetic studies has been consistently validated for AD other than these loci
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	In order to identify new AD-associated SNPs, we designed a new case-control GWAS in the Spanish population.

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We merged each study with the HapMap CEU samples and compared genotype calls.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	SNP calls were flipped (if typed on the opposite strand) or removed (if the strand could not be undoubtedly assigned) as necessary.

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Principal components analysis was carried out with EIGENSOFT to evaluate population admixture within each population, and to identify individuals as outliers.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We ran the SMARTPCA program with default parameters, excluding chromosome X markers.

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Individuals identified as outliers (six SDs or more along one of the top ten principal components) were removed from all subsequent analyses.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Principal component analysis was run within each dataset, and also together with other HapMap European and worldwide populations to detect individuals of different ethnicities

0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	METHODS	Although the main results of the study are unadjusted estimates and P-values from the allelic test, multivariate logistic regression models were also used to adjust estimates for the combined Spanish samples (Murcia GWAS and the replica) by age, sex, and APOE E+ status using the Logistic option in Plink.
0	NA	NA	rs1562990	METHODS	A final meta-analysis and Forest plot for the marker rs1562990, including the five original GWASs plus the two 'in silico' replicas and the final replica, was done with the Stata 10.0 (College Station, TX, USA) metan command

0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Although limited by the number of SNPs available from these studies, the new meta-analysis yielded quite interesting results, with a total of 17 markers above the GWAS significance level (Additional file 4).
1	Alzheimer's disease	apolipoprotein E	rs536841	RESULTS	Several signals belonged to known AD loci: APOE with eight SNPs, PICALM (three SNPS, the most significant being rs536841, P = 2.96E-9), CLU (rs569214, P = 4.11E-8), and BIN1 (rs744373, P = 2.13E-9).
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	Most important, we found four SNPs that belong to a region in chromosome 11q12 not previously reported as GWAS significant for AD.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	rs1562990	RESULTS	The new peak for AD is located within the MS4A cluster and the most significant SNP was rs1562990 (OR 0.87; P = 3.01E-10)
1	NA	apolipoprotein E	rs1562990	RESULTS	Since we have previously published replication studies of APOE, CLU, PICALM and BIN1 signals in the Spanish population, we decided to replicate only rs1562990 in 2,200 cases and 2,301 controls from the this population.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Importantly, the result of this new independent replica was fully consistent, yielding a significant OR of 0.90 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 0.98; P = .01).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Detailed results for the original Spanish GWAS dataset, Spanish replica sample, and the combined Spanish dataset are described in Additional file 5.
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	RESULTS	We fitted a multivariate logistic regression model for the combined Spanish sample in which we adjusted for age, sex and APOE.
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	RESULTS	The adjusted OR estimate was virtually unchanged (OR 0.87; 95% CI 0.74 to 1.04; P = 0.12), suggesting that the observed effect is not influenced by age, sex or APOE in our series
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Finally, combining this new replication in a final meta-analysis together with the five original GWASs and the two 'in silico' replications yields an OR of 0.88 (95% CI 0.85 to 0.91; P = 4.4E-11), which exceeds the accepted threshold for testing multiple comparisons (that is, P < 5E-8).

0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	Our results point to the existence of a new AD locus located within the MS4A cluster at 11q12.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	Coincidentally, during the drafting of this manuscript two independent articles emerged reaching similar conclusions regarding MS4A cluster involvement in AD.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Certainly, the SNP markers described in the three studies are different, but they are only 83,871 bp apart.
0	NA	NA	rs4938933	RESULTS	However, our signal is closer to rs4938933 (reported by Naj et al.
0	NA	NA	rs1562990	RESULTS	), which is only 9 kb centromeric to rs1562990.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	In any case, peak markers observed in these studies are located in the same haplotypic block and have identical effect size and direction, which strongly suggest that they are tracking the same functional variant
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	It is important to mention that sample overlapping exists between these studies.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Nonetheless, at least three full datasets contained in our study (comprising 7,809 individuals, 31%) do not overlap with previous published works.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Importantly, meta-analysis using only these non-overlapping samples also rendered a significant association with the MS4A region (OR = 0.897; 95% CI 0.838 to 0.961; P = 0.0018).
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	Therefore, our study could be considered an independent replication of the involvement of the MSA4A gene cluster in AD.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	The concurrence of three independent studies reaching the same conclusion by employing different SNP platforms, imputation methods and datasets underscores the strength and consistency of this new AD locus, at least in European populations.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	Further studies will be necessary to corroborate its involvement in AD etiology in other ethnic groups
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The MS4A family includes at least 16 paralogues.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Each gene has been probably generated by an ancestral cascade of intrachromosomal duplications during vertebrate evolution.
0	NA	MS4A1	NA	RESULTS	Unfortunately, this gene family is poorly characterized, although a role in immunity has already been shown for several members this cluster, including MS4A1 (CD20), MS4A2 and MS4A4B .
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	However, the function in humans of many other members remains obscure and a more general involvement of MS4A family members as ion channel adaptor proteins in non-immune tissues is suspected
0	NA	MS4A4E	rs1562990	RESULTS	The rs1562990 marker maps between MS4A4E and MS4A4A members of the cluster.
0	NA	MS4A2	NA	RESULTS	However, we detected a critical linkage disequilibrium haplotype block spanning 163 kb that comprises three members of the family (MS4A2, MS4A6A, and MS4A4) and the top four meta-GWAS-significant markers (Additional file 4).
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	With the available data it is difficult to determine the precise location of the functional variant associated with AD, or even which gene could be the best candidate for AD etiology.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Furthermore, it may be the case that a functional non-coding variant within the cluster might alter, by cis-regulation, the function of other members of the cluster simultaneously.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Re-sequencing and functional studies of candidate mutations could help resolve this question
0	NA	MS4A2	NA	RESULTS	The most centromeric gene within the critical block, MS4A2, encodes a protein that binds to the Fc region of immunoglobulin epsilon.
0	NA	MS4A2	NA	RESULTS	MS4A2 seems responsible for initiating the allergic response by binding of allergen to receptor-bound IgE, which leads to cell activation and the release of mediators (such as histamine).
0	allergy	NA	NA	RESULTS	This signal cascade is responsible for the manifestations of allergy.
0	aspirin-intolerant asthma	MS4A2	NA	RESULTS	Indeed, polymorphisms within the MS4A2 gene have been associated with susceptibility to aspirin-intolerant asthma, and some epidemiological studies suggest a link between asthma and AD.
0	Alzheimer's disease	MS4A2	NA	RESULTS	Consequently, a hypothetical link between MS4A2 and AD would add new evidence in favor of the AD neuroinflammatory hypothesis, suggesting a role for the immune system in the pathogenesis of AD.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The other genes within the candidate block are poorly characterized and it is not easy to delineate a plausible hypothesis for them yet
