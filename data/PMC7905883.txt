0	cardiovascular disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death globally, and the prevalence of cardiovascular disease is constantly progressing in both developed and developing nations.
0	death	NA	NA	INTRO	According to a World Health Organization report, an estimated 17.9 million people died from heart disease and stroke in 2016, representing 31% of all global deaths, and it was projected that about 23.6 million people will die from CVDs by 2030.
0	death	NA	NA	INTRO	In line with the global trend, economic and social developments have significantly impacted lifestyles of Koreans; CVDs are now one of the main causes of death in Korea, accounting for 1 in every 5 deaths.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Therefore, interventions to prevent and reduce cardiovascular risk factors are warranted
0	cardiovascular disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Epidemiological evidence suggest that CVD is associated with age, sex, ethnicity, behavioral risk factors (smoking, alcohol use, and low physical activity levels), and several chronic metabolic diseases.
0	hypertension	NA	NA	INTRO	Among them, hypertension (HTN), dyslipidemia (DL), and type 2 diabetes (DM) are the most common modifiable risk factors for CVD, which is known as the most prevalent cause of mortality and morbidity in populations with HTN, DM, and DL.
0	cardiovascular disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Approximately two-thirds of all adults with HTN at 30 years of age have a ~ 40% higher risk of experiencing a CVD event and systematic reviews have revealed that lowering blood pressure greatly reduced major CVD events and all-cause mortality, irrespective of the initial blood pressure.
0	DM	NA	NA	INTRO	Patients with DM had a 10% greater risk of coronary artery disease (CAD), a 53% greater risk of myocardial infarction (MI), and a 58% greater risk of stroke compared to those without diagnoses of DM, and CVD accounts for approximately half of all deaths in patients with DM, largely due to an increased risk of stroke and MI.
0	cardiovascular disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Further, in the INTERHEART study, 49% of the population-attributable risk of a first MI was contributed by DL, and the prevalence of DL was found to be between 83 and 87% in Asian patients with CVD
0	cardiovascular disease	NA	NA	INTRO	There are various biochemical mechanisms that independently increase the risk of CVD in people with these chronic metabolic diseases.
0	atherosclerotic	NA	NA	INTRO	Lipid oxidation is thought to be an important determinant of atherosclerosis, which leads to CVD; moreover, high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) are associated with MI and stroke in DL.
0	Inflammation Laboratory's JDRF	NA	NA	INTRO	Endothelial dysfunction, vascular inflammation, arterial remodeling, atherosclerosis, dyslipidemia, and obesity are common risk factors for CVD in HTN and DM.
0	Inflammation Laboratory's JDRF	NA	NA	INTRO	In addition, upregulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, oxidative stress, inflammation, and activation of the immune system contribute to the close relationship between DM, HTN, and CVD
0	metabolic disorder	NA	NA	INTRO	However, only limited evidence is available regarding the relationship between multiple chronic metabolic diseases and CVDs.
0	DM	NA	NA	INTRO	Furthermore, despite maintaining optimal levels of metabolic indices, such as blood pressure, glucose, or lipids, CVDs still remain prevalent in individuals with HTN, DM, and DL.
0	hyperglycemia	NA	NA	INTRO	Evidence suggest that although hyperglycemia contributes to ischemic events, it is not the only factor, because both pre-diabetes and normoglycemic patients show risk for most types of CVD.
0	cardiovascular disease	NA	NA	INTRO	High-dose statin therapy may provide some incremental benefit between 10 and 20%; nevertheless, statin-treated patients remain at high residual risk for future cardiovascular events.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	This suggests that other non-modifiable risk factors, such as genetic and genomic variables, need to be considered as well
0	cardiovascular disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Genetic factors are important contributors to the risk of CVDs; recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) strongly support that genetic susceptibility to CVD is largely derived from gene mutations or variation.
0	obese	NA	NA	INTRO	Loci nearest a lead single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was shown to have genome-wide significant associations with obesity, blood pressure, lipids, DM, CAD, and stroke.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	However, over the past decade, the majority of GWASs for CVDs or related risk factors have been conducted in populations with European white ancestry and limited evidence is available in Asian populations.
0	cardiovascular disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Furthermore, few analyses focused on the genetic differences in CVD susceptibility between individuals with the same chronic metabolic conditions
0	DM	NA	NA	INTRO	Therefore, we conducted three sets of GWASs between case-controls of major CVDs in HTN, DM, and DL patient groups using data from the well-known nationwide Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES).
0	cardiovascular disease	NA	NA	INTRO	We aimed to find genetic pathways linking the development of CVD with each metabolic disease group; we further aimed to identify the potential presence of a common pathway leading to CVD among the commonly co-existing metabolic conditions

0	cardiovascular disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Considering the small sample size, we consider this finding to bear significance, which confers on 17q25.3 the status of a common susceptibility locus of CVD in HTN, DM, and DL.
0	metabolic disorder	NA	NA	DISCUSS	"It has not been fully elucidated whether these chronic metabolic diseases are part of the causal pathway for CVD or merely comorbid diseases in ""common soil""."
0	metabolic disorder	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The search has been fraught with controversial findings, as has the presence of overlap in the genetic architecture of metabolic diseases and CVDs.
0	cardiovascular disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This study provides first probable evidence of a common candidate locus for CVD in the 3 diseases using a GWAS approach
0	Stroke	ULK4	NA	DISCUSS	Locus 3p22.1 [ULK4] of DL-IS risk seems likely to be associated with ULK4; recently, ULK4 was identified by GWAS and brain eQTL to be a susceptibility gene for IS and small vessel stroke in trans-ethnic datasets.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, CTNN1B of the WNT gene family is another possibility.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The Wnt signaling pathway contributes to the development of CVDs; both canonical and noncanonical Wnt signaling cascades moderate cell phenotypic modulation of vascular smooth muscles in CVDs.
0	vascular dementia	beta-catenin	NA	DISCUSS	CTNN1B encodes beta-catenin and is essential in maintaining CNS homeostasis; in terms of arteriosclerotic effects, CTNN1B was found to harbor a susceptibility variant for MI in the Han population.
0	cerebral infarctions	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Recently, expression of vital genes in the Wnt pathway (including CTNN1B) was found to be upregulated in cerebral infarction in rats; it seems plausible that similar findings could be found in humans
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Finally, 2p22.2 [CYP1B1-CYP1B1-AS1] of DL-CCD risk could be associated with Cytochrome P450 1B1(CYP1B1), a member of the well-known Cytochrome P450 family.
0	NA	CYP1B1	NA	DISCUSS	CYP1B1 is expressed in various tissues, with the highest mRNA expression levels found extrahepatically, such as the heart and brain.
0	atherosclerotic	CYP1B1	NA	DISCUSS	Recent findings have shown that CYP1B1 contributes to the development of atherosclerosis, DL, and HTN in rats; demonstrates an association with DM; and has a suggested influence on adipogenesis
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	There are limitations to our study.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	First, replication is lacking, and the findings may not be generalized to cohorts with different ethnicities and races.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Second, we investigated the phenotypes of diseases using a patient-reported questionnaire and thus could not investigate various CVDs or measurable continuous traits.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Third, this work is based on statistical evidence and does not provide functional experimental validation.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Potential genetic interactions using biological and mechanical analyses are required to confirm these findings, and additional studies are warranted for replication and validation
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Despite these limitations, our study has several unique strengths.
0	cardiovascular disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Many studies have demonstrated varied findings regarding the genetic relations between CVD and its risk factors.
0	cardiovascular disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, most previous studies utilized variants of genome-wide significance or genotyping arrays that focused only on pre-selected loci, and they have not fully utilized genome-wide variation for the estimation of genetic variants of CVD risk.
0	cardiovascular disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Moreover, none of these previous studies have focused on the genetic variants of CVD within the same chronic conditions.
0	cardiovascular disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	To the best of our knowledge, the present study provides novel evidence of genetic associations with CVD specific to individuals with HTN, DM, and DL.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Charmet et al.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	found novel candidates for CAD using a then unprecedented similar study design (434 cases and 3,123 controls), in patients with type 1 diabetes.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The barrier of limited statistical power due to sample size may be why such studies are lacking
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Although some of our findings showed low prevalence, the overall effect size is significant with high ORs.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Also, the allele frequency may be underestimated due to smaller quality genomic databases of East Asians used in forming the reference panels.
0	metabolic disorder	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Further, cardio-metabolic diseases associated with CVDs have been increasing in prevalence as well as in total medical costs in Asians, with HTN and DM ranking 1st and 2nd among all medical diagnoses in Korea, respectively.
0	dyslipidemia	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Dyslipidemia prevalence has been rapidly increasing up to 38.4% of all adults, and CVDs account for 1/4 of total mortality of the Korean population according to recent data.
0	DM	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our preliminary findings may be used to improve the identification of individuals with HTN, DM, or DL at high-risk for cardiovascular events or to provide novel targets for potential pharmacologic development.
0	metabolic disorder	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In the era of personalized, preventive medicine with progressively aging populations with chronic cardio-metabolic diseases, further comprehensive analyses of our findings seem highly warranted
0	NA	NA	NA	CONCL	In conclusion, our GWAS, of unprecedented design, provides several novel insights into the genetic architecture of CVDs.
0	cardiovascular disease	NA	NA	CONCL	We report 6 loci with genome-wide significant association for CVDs, which harbor numerous potential positional candidate genes, and show substantial CVD risk discrimination in individuals with HTN, DM, or DL.
