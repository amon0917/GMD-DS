0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Breast cancer, one of the most common malignancies among women worldwide, is a complex polygenic disease in which genetic factors play a significant role in the disease etiology.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	So far, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have reported over 40 common low-penetrance variants in 25 loci that are associated with the breast cancer risk reported in the National Human Genome Research Institute catalog.
0	NA	FGFR2	rs2981582	INTRO	The most strongly and consistently associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) reside in intron 2 of the receptor tyrosine kinase FGFR2 (rs2981582) at 10q26.13 and near the 5' end of the TOX3 gene at 16q12.1 (rs3803662).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	With the exception of three studies conducted among Asian women, all other previously published GWASs have been conducted primarily in women of European descent.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Several studies, including our study, have investigated previously identified loci in European populations in other ethnic groups and validated the initial findings.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	However, newly discovered loci initially identified in women of European descent tend to be weakly associated with breast cancer in women of Asian descent or could not be confirmed in Asians because of the difference in linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns between ethnic populations, suggesting that additional genetic variants for Asian women remain to be discovered
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	In this study, we conducted a three-stage GWAS to identify common breast cancer susceptibility loci and to validate the previously reported loci by using Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) with 2,273 patients with breast cancer from the Seoul Breast Cancer Study (SeBCS) and 2,052 healthy controls from a large urban cohort, the Korea Genome Epidemiology Study (KoGES), as stage I.

0	NA	FGFR2	rs10736393	DISCUSS	Furthermore, the rs10736393 is located at intron 2 of FGFR2 within the sequences conserved across all placental mammals and suggested to be a functional variant to regulate FGFR expression by generating a putative ER-binding site.
0	breast cancer	NA	rs10736393	DISCUSS	In the present study, the rs10736393 G allele was significantly associated with increased breast cancer risk with an effect size of rs2981579 that was the same as in a previous report.
0	NA	FGFR2	rs10510102	DISCUSS	However, the recently added SNP, rs10510102, located in the 300-kb telomeric region of intron 2 of FGFR2 but not with a genome-wide significance level (P = 1.6 x 10-6), was not replicated in the present study
0	NA	ER	NA	DISCUSS	Subgroup analysis revealed that some of the validated associations differed by ER or PR status.
0	cancers	NA	rs13387042	DISCUSS	Recent studies showed stronger associations with ER+ than with ER- tumors for several loci - rs13387042(2q35), rs4973768 (3p24), rs889312 (5q11.2/MAP3K1), rs7716600 (5q12/MRP30), rs13281615 (8q24), rs1219648 and rs2981582 (10q26.13/FGFR2), and rs3803662 (16q12) - and with PR+ than with PR- tumors for rs2981582 (10q26.13/FGFR2).
0	cancers	ER	rs13387042	DISCUSS	Among these loci, rs13387042 (2q35), rs7716600, and rs4415084 (5q12/MRP30) showed significantly different associations by ER status, and rs4973768 (3p24) also showed a stronger association with ER+ tumors, although the test for heterogeneity was not significant.
0	breast cancer	FBXO18	rs2380205	DISCUSS	The association of rs2380205 (10p15.1/ANKRD16, FBXO18) with breast cancer risk was also stronger for ER+ or PR+ tumors than with negative tumors, and this heterogeneity in association remains to be evaluated in other populations
0	cancers	NA	rs2046210	DISCUSS	The stronger association of rs2046210 at 6q25.1/ESR1 with ER- than with ER+ tumors has been well documented.
0	NA	NA	rs2046210	DISCUSS	In the present study, we could also observe this heterogeneity for rs2046210 and its nearby SNP rs3784805, although the differences were not statistically significant.
0	breast cancer	ER	NA	DISCUSS	Direct replication in some of the loci showing significant differences in associations according to ER or PR status provides further support for the hypothesis that intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer should have different etiologic pathways; thus, the polygenic component of these subtypes of breast cancer should be different
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	There are several potential reasons for the failure of validation for previously identified loci in women of European descent.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	First, several risk variants could escape detection because of the limited statistical power caused by either low allele frequency or a very small effect size of the initial findings.
0	NA	FCGR1B	rs11249433	DISCUSS	There are several SNPs of which the allele frequencies in Koreans are substantially lower than in Europeans: SNP rs11249433 at 1p11.2/NOTCH2, FCGR1B (4% versus 39%), rs1011970 at 9p21.3/CDKN2A, CDKN2B (7% versus 17%), rs865686 at 9q31.2/KLF4, RAD23B, ACTL7A (7% versus 24%), rs10995190 at 10q21.2/ZNF365 (2% versus 15%), and rs10483813, proxy of rs999737, at 14q24.1/RAD51L (3% versus 24%).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Thus, we have only 8% to 30% of the statistical power to detect the reported effect sizes of 1.06 to 1.16 for these SNPs with the current sample size.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We could not exclude the possibility that the effect size of the original reports could be represented as exaggerated ORs caused by 'winner's curse'.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Second, a difference in underlying genomic structure between ethnicities could produce the bias to cover SNPs tagging the causal variants, although the reported SNPs could work effectively in women of European descent.
0	breast cancer	NA	rs2180341	DISCUSS	Another possibility is that some of the variants evaluated may not be strongly associated with breast cancer risk in Asian women such as shown in the null association of rs2180341 (6q22.33).
0	NA	NA	rs3180341	DISCUSS	For rs3180341, we had a statistical power of 80% to detect an OR as small as 1.15; furthermore, the lack of an association has been shown in a study conducted in a Chinese population.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Moreover, the risk profiles of genetic variants could be manifested differently in different ethnic populations, assuming that the relative contribution of the risk variants to carcinogenic pathways of breast cancer varies between different populations.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Finally, the interactions of environmental exposures, lifestyle, or other effect modifiers and even the difference in breast cancer prevalence could have an effect on the penetrance of these alleles
1	NA	ERBB4	rs13393577	DISCUSS	The ERBB4, harboring rs13393577 in the first intron at 2q34, is a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF/ERBB) family of receptor tyrosine kinases, which are key activators of signaling pathways involved in cell division, migration, adhesion, differentiation, and apoptosis.
0	breast cancer	ERBB4	NA	DISCUSS	It is reported that ERBB4 is frequently overexpressed in breast cancer, and the expression of transcripts encoding the cleavable ERBB4 isoforms was associated with ER expression and a high histological grade of differentiation.
0	breast cancer	ERBB4	-782T > G	DISCUSS	Rokavec and colleagues identified the presence of five germ-line variants in the ERBB4 5'-untranslated region and reported that one of these variants (ERBB4 -782T > G) was associated with breast cancer risk from the different promoter activity according to the different allele.
1	NA	ERBB4	rs13393577	DISCUSS	However, rs13393577 is not in LD with ERBB4 -782T > G; thus, the potential influence of rs13393577 is unlikely to be mediated through this previously reported variant
1	NA	NA	rs13393577	DISCUSS	We conducted an in silico functional analysis to assess the potential biological function of rs13393577.
1	NA	NA	rs13393577	DISCUSS	The rs13393577 C allele had no predicted binding site, whereas several transcription factors were predicted to bind the rs13393577 T allele implementing six high-scoring binding sites (maximum score = 92.7 points; minimum score = 85.9 points).
1	NA	NA	rs13393577	DISCUSS	In agreement with this, FASTSNP scored rs13393577 as 1-2 (intronic enhancer).
0	breast cancer	ERBB4	rs905883	DISCUSS	Additionally, Murabito and colleagues have shown that three SNPs in ERBB4 (rs905883, rs7564590, and rs7558615) were associated with breast cancer risk in a family-based GWAS that included 58 breast cancer cases, although no association was attained with genome-wide significance level.
1	NA	NA	rs7564590	DISCUSS	Among these variants, rs7564590 is in moderate LD with rs13393577 (r2 = 0.44 in CHB+JPT and r2 = 0.25 in CEU) whereas the other two SNPs (rs905883 and rs755861515) are in very weak LD with rs13393577 (all r2 < 0.02 in CHB+JPT and CEU).
1	NA	NA	rs13393577	DISCUSS	Thus, if both rs13393577 and rs7564590 are not themselves functional, they might be in high LD with the true causal variants.
1	NA	mir-548f-2	rs13393577	DISCUSS	Additionally, we could not exclude the possibility that the strong association shown in rs13393577 is related to the function of the mir-548f-2 gene harboring SNP rs6956468, which is in tight LD with rs13393577
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	CONCL	In summary, we have confirmed 10 SNPs in seven loci of breast cancer risk which were initially identified in European or Chinese populations or both and provided additional evidence confirming the heterogeneity in the risk of different tumor subtypes for common breast cancer susceptibility variants.
1	breast cancer	ERBB4	rs13393577	CONCL	Moreover, we identified rs13393577 in ERBB4 located at 2q34 as a new breast cancer susceptibility variant.
0	NA	NA	NA	CONCL	Future studies, including fine mapping, functional assay, and a replication study with large sample sizes from diverse ethnic populations, are needed to validate our results
