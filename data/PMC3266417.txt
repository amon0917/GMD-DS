1	NA	CDKAL1	NA	ABSTRACT	In conclusion, we have confirmed that genetic variants in CDKAL1 and near MTNR1B are strongly associated with GDM in Korean women.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	There seems to be a shared genetic basis between GDM and type 2 diabetes
0	Type 2 diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	There has been a marked increase in our understanding of the genetic predisposition to type 2 diabetes as a result of the technical advances in array-based genotyping and the knowledge derived from the Human Genome Project.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	Recent genome-wide association (GWA) studies and meta-analyses, including the Diabetes Genetics Replication and Meta-analysis+ (DIAGRAM+) Study, the Meta-analyses of Glucose and Insulin-Related Traits Consortium (MAGIC) Study, and the recent GWA studies of type 2 diabetes in Asians, enlisted up to 41 genetic risk loci for type 2 diabetes or glycemic traits.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	However, these loci explain only a limited part of the expected heritability of type 2 diabetes.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	A complementary approach to improve our insight into the genetics of diabetes might involve the identification of genetic risk loci in a different subtype of diabetes, such as gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	This approach could enable us to compare the genetic risk factors between type 2 diabetes and GDM and relate the similarities and dissimilarities to the pathophysiology of the two closely related diseases
0	glucose homeostasis	NA	NA	INTRO	GDM is defined as abnormal glucose tolerance first recognized during pregnancy.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The estimated prevalence of GDM varies according to ethnicity, and in Korean women, 2-5 of 100 pregnancies are complicated by GDM.
0	NA	insulin	NA	INTRO	During pregnancy, women are faced with increased adiposity and increased insulin resistance.
0	NA	insulin	NA	INTRO	The insulin resistance that develops during pregnancy is explained in part by the increased production of human placental lactogen, estrogen, and prolactin.
0	NA	insulin	NA	INTRO	Those who have limited beta-cell capacity for the compensation of insulin resistance are likely to develop GDM.
0	diabetes	insulin	NA	INTRO	Women with GDM are assumed to have decreased beta-cell insulin secretory function similar to type 2 diabetes.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	After parturition, nearly one-half of these women progress to type 2 diabetes within 5 years.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	Therefore, GDM is often regarded as a herald of type 2 diabetes in later life
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	Based on these findings, it can be hypothesized that GDM and type 2 diabetes share a common genetic background.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	We have previously reported that some of the genetic variants that are strongly associated with type 2 diabetes are similarly associated with GDM risk.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	However, genetic knowledge in the context of GDM is still limited, and systematic approaches such as GWA studies have not been applied to GDM.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Thus, it is not known whether there are genetic risk loci specific to GDM.

0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, only a limited number of genetic variants known to be associated with type 2 diabetes have been tested thus far, and a systematic approach such as GWA analysis has not been applied to GDM until now.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the genetic association of GDM using dense SNP markers across the whole genome
0	diabetes	CDKAL1	NA	DISCUSS	Variants in CDKAL1 are known to be strongly associated with type 2 diabetes.
1	diabetes	CDKAL1	rs7754840	DISCUSS	In our previous studies, the variant rs7754840 in CDKAL1 was significantly associated with GDM risk in 1,501 Koreans as well as type 2 diabetes in 6,719 Asians including Koreans.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The precise mechanism by which this variant confers type 2 diabetes and GDM risk is not yet clearly understood.
0	NA	CDKAL1	NA	DISCUSS	CDKAL1 (cyclin-dependent kinase 5 [CDK5] regulatory subunit-associated protein 1-like 1) has been suggested to interact with CDK5 because it has homology with CDK5RAP1, a known inhibitor of CDK5.
0	pancreatic	CDK5	NA	DISCUSS	CDK5 is expressed in pancreatic beta-cells, and it has recently been reported to promote beta-cell survival.
0	NA	insulin	NA	DISCUSS	Pregnancy is a state in which increased insulin resistance results in stress that adversely affects beta-cell survival.
0	NA	CDKAL1	NA	DISCUSS	Therefore, it may be postulated that variants in CDKAL1 might alter the function of CDK5 in beta-cell compensation during pregnancy.
1	NA	CDKAL1	rs7754840	DISCUSS	The rs7754840 C variant of CDKAL1 was significantly associated with decreased insulin concentration and HOMA-B in our subjects with GDM, which implies compromised beta-cell compensation.
0	decreased birth weight	CDKAL1	NA	DISCUSS	It also should be noted that variants in CDKAL1 are associated with decreased birth weight, which could be explained by reduced fetal insulin secretion
1	NA	MTNR1B	NA	DISCUSS	Variants in MTNR1B were first identified as genetic risk factors strongly associated with elevated fasting glucose.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Although it also was associated with type 2 diabetes risk in Europeans, the strength of association was rather weak compared with its association with fasting glucose.
1	diabetes	MTNR1B	rs10830962	DISCUSS	It is interesting that the rs10830962 variant in MTNR1B was the second most strongly associated loci in GDM but was not associated with type 2 diabetes risk in a large-scale meta-GWA study of East Asians (AGEN type 2 diabetes meta-GWA study).
1	diabetes	MTNR1B	rs10830962	DISCUSS	The effect size of the MTNR1B rs10830962 variant was considerably different in our GDM GWA study (beta = 0.374) compared with the AGEN type 2 diabetes meta-GWA study (beta = 0.040).
0	diabetes	NA	rs10830962	DISCUSS	The risk allele of rs10830962 G was enriched in women with GDM (risk allele frequency 0.529 and 0.537 in stage 1 and stage 2 subjects, respectively) compared with AGEN type 2 diabetic subjects (risk allele frequency range for participating studies 0.40-0.46).
0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	It is not clear why this variant is more strongly associated with the risk of GDM compared with type 2 diabetes.
1	diabetes	MTNR1B	NA	DISCUSS	However, it could be cautiously speculated that there might be differences in genetic susceptibility between type 2 diabetes and GDM conferred by the variants of MTNR1B.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Additional investigations are required to confirm these findings
1	pancreatic	MTNR1B	NA	DISCUSS	It was recently revealed that MTNR1B is expressed in pancreatic beta-cells.
1	NA	insulin	NA	DISCUSS	Melatonin is thought to inhibit insulin secretion from beta-cells through the activation of MTNR1B, which is a G-protein-coupled receptor.
0	Type 2 diabetes	insulin	rs10830962	DISCUSS	The rs10830962 variant is in strong LD (r2 = 0.98, in our study subjects) with rs10830963, which originally was reported to be associated with fasting glucose concentrations, insulin concentrations, and type 2 diabetes.
1	NA	MTNR1B	rs1083092	DISCUSS	It is interesting that the rs1083092 variant is located 4.36 kb upstream of MTNR1B and in the vicinity of the region where monomethylation of lysine 4 of histone 3 (H3K4Me1), known as an enhancer-associated histone mark, was enriched in the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements database (http://genome.ucsc.edu/encode/).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	It would be of worth to study the functional role of this variant as well as to search for causative variants near this locus, especially in the promoter and/or enhancer region
0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Because we performed a GWA analysis using 2.19 million genotyped or imputed markers, we were able to test the hypothesis that GDM and type 2 diabetes might share a similar genetic background.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Among 11 variants listed in Table 2, five SNPs were located near the known type 2 diabetes loci.
1	diabetes	CDKAL1	rs7754840	DISCUSS	Three variants that showed an association at or near genome-wide significance, rs7754840 in CDKAL1, rs10830962 near MTNR1B, and rs1470579 in IGF2BP2, were identical or in strong LD with known type 2 diabetes variants.
0	diabetes	NA	rs10757261	DISCUSS	Two other variants, rs10757261 in CDKN2A/2B and rs10882066 in IDE, were not in LD with known type 2 diabetes variants (r2 = 0.013 between rs10757261 and rs10811661 and r2 = 0.002 between rs10882066 and rs5015480).
0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Given that many of the type 2 diabetes risk loci were associated with GDM, unbiased GWA studies of GDM showed genome-wide significant associations confined to known type 2 diabetes loci, and the effect size of the type 2 diabetes risk variants in GDM and type 2 diabetes were mostly comparable, it would be acceptable to state that GDM and type 2 diabetes share a similar genetic background
1	NA	CDKAL1	NA	DISCUSS	Among the known type 2 diabetes-related genes, those that are thought to modulate pancreatic beta-cell function were preferentially associated with GDM (CDKAL1, MTNR1B, IGF2BP2, CDKN2A/2B, SLC30A8, IDE, KCNQ1, and CENTD2) (Table 4).
0	NA	insulin	NA	DISCUSS	In contrast, loci relevant to insulin resistance, such as FTO, PPARG, IRS1, KLF14, and GCKR were not significantly associated with GDM (Table 4).
0	pancreatic	insulin	NA	DISCUSS	These findings support the previous notion that defective pancreatic beta-cell compensation to overcome increased insulin resistance during pregnancy might be the core pathophysiology of GDM
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	There are certain limitations in our study.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	First, the sample size was relatively modest for a GWA, and we had limited power in detecting possible variants with small effect size.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Assuming a 2.2% prevalence of GDM, a disease allele frequency of 0.3, and a genotype relative risk of 1.5 in a multiplicative model, our study had 93% power.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, when genotype relative risk was assumed to be 1.4, the power dropped to 68%.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	It is possible that variants with a small effect would not have been detected in our study.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Therefore, we might have missed genetic variants that have a small effect but are specific to GDM.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Regarding the study design, the control group was not fully evaluated for their glucose tolerance status during pregnancy and parity.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	It is possible that women with GDM might have been included in the control group.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, because the prevalence of GDM was estimated to be 2.2% in Korean women, and approximately one-half of these women progress to type 2 diabetes within 10 years, only ~<=1% of women with GDM would have been included in the control group.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Therefore, we speculate that the ascertainment bias would have been minimal.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In studying genetic variants of GDM, the ideal control group would be pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, we were only able to use nondiabetic control women as control subjects.
1	NA	CDKAL1	NA	DISCUSS	This could be one of the reasons that variants in CDKAL1 and MTNR1B were most significantly associated with GDM in our study.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In this regard, the results of our study should be interpreted cautiously
1	NA	CDKAL1	NA	DISCUSS	In conclusion, we have performed a GWA study in the context of GDM for the first time and confirmed that variants in CDKAL1 and MTNR1B confer the risk of GDM with genome-wide significance.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	By comparing genetic variants in GDM and type 2 diabetes, we provide evidence that they share a similar genetic background.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We hope that even larger GWA studies of GDM and meta-GWA studies could further reveal the genetic risk loci for GDM
