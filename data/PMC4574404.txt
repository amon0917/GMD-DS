0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide and a leading cause of cancer-related deaths.
0	breast cancer	ER	NA	INTRO	Breast cancer can be divided into two major types by the estrogen receptor alpha (ER) status; ER-positive breast cancer is driven by the female hormone estrogen whereas ER-negative breast cancer does not depend on estrogen.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Endocrine therapies target the ER-positive type, which accounts for about 70% of all breast cancer.
0	NA	ER	NA	INTRO	Currently available endocrine therapies aim to either selectively block the estrogen receptor by binding ER (tamoxifen), decrease ovarian estrogen production (ovarian ablation, luteinising hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists) or, in post-menopausal women, blocking the conversion of androgen to estrogen in peripheral fat (aromatase inhibitors) or selectively down-regulating ER (e.g.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	fulvestrant).
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that breast cancer recurrence and death may be reduced by approximately one third by endocrine adjuvant treatments in patients with ER-positive breast cancer.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	However, approximately 30% of ERalpha-positive breast cancers do not respond to endocrine therapies (de novo resistance) and in addition, the majority of tumors that initially respond to treatment develop resistance over time (acquired resistance)
0	cancers	ER	NA	INTRO	There are several potential mechanisms of resistance to endocrine therapy (reviewed in) including e.g., as the most important mechanism, loss of expression of ER alpha (due to an emerging subclone of ER-negative cancer).
0	metabolic disorder	ER	NA	INTRO	Beside mechanisms related to ER, resistance to endocrine therapy may also occur due to increased growth factor signalling and dysfunctional metabolism of hormonal agents.
0	NA	CYP2D6	NA	INTRO	As an example, patients carrying inactive alleles of CYP2D6 (approximately 7-10% of Caucasian women) fail to convert tamoxifen to its primary active metabolite, endoxifen, and may consequently be less responsive to tamoxifen.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	However, the association with endocrine treatment outcome remains currently controversial.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Presently, aside from ER status, no unequivocal biomarkers have been identified to determine whether a patient will benefit from adjuvant endocrine therapy
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Germline genetic variations, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), have been assessed as potential predictors of survival for breast cancer patients in general and in different subgroups including those defined by endocrine therapies.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	A majority of these studies have applied a candidate gene approach focusing on SNPs within pre-specified genes of interest.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	These studies have provided some indicative results, but further studies will be needed to validate the findings.
0	breast cancer	ARRDC3	NA	INTRO	Recently, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been performed with the aim of identifying genetic variants influencing the outcome of breast cancer, including our previous studies that identified ARRDC3 locus influencing prognosis in especially early-onset breast cancer.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Further, a GWAS conducted in subgroup of patients receiving adjuvant tamoxifen therapy in a Japanese population detected significant associations with recurrence-free survival at 10q22
0	breast cancer	POSH	NA	INTRO	The availability of GWA data from the patient population in our Helsinki Breast Cancer Study (HEBCS) study together with GWA data from Prospective study of Outcomes in Sporadic versus Hereditary breast cancer (POSH) study enables an agnostic genome-wide approach to identify common genetic variants associated with survival for breast cancer.

0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	ER-positive breast cancer is commonly treated with adjuvant endocrine therapies.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Adjuvant endocrine treatment has been shown to increase overall survival and in light of recent studies is likely to be recommended for even longer duration in the adjuvant setting.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However many patients do not benefit from these therapies and predictors for response or resistance to endocrine treatment are urgently needed.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In this study we report a meta-analysis of two genome wide studies and two validation datasets for identifying genetic variants associated with breast cancer related mortality specifically after adjuvant endocrine treatment.
0	NA	NA	rs8113308	DISCUSS	In a meta-analysis involving individuals treated with adjuvant endocrine therapy we identified SNP rs8113308 specifically and significantly predicting outcome after endocrine treatment.
0	cancers	NA	rs8113308	DISCUSS	We were further able to show that among patients with ER-positive tumors, there is a significant interaction between the rs8113308 and endocrine treatment indicating a predictive, treatment-specific effect on survival, independent of conventional prognostic markers.
0	NA	NA	rs4767413	DISCUSS	In addition, SNP rs4767413 showed a consistent association across all four studies among ER-positive endocrine treated patients and a significant interaction result with endocrine treatment in stage I.
0	NA	POSH	NA	DISCUSS	However, the survival association was not significant in stage II studies (POSH validation and SUCCESS-A), and no further supportive evidence could be obtained from the eQTL and gene expression survival analyses.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	These results thus remain inconclusive and warrant further studies
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our primary interest in this study was to evaluate the breast cancer specific survival.
0	breast cancer	POSH	NA	DISCUSS	In stage I studies (HEBCS GWS and POSH GWS) and stage II POSH validation the analyses were performed using breast cancer specific mortality as the endpoint.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	A randomized clinical trial, SUCCESS-A, with data available via dbGAP was added to further validate our stage I findings.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Since the only outcome data available for SUCCESS-A was overall or progression free survival, we used overall survival as the endpoint for SUCCESS-A in the stage II main meta-analysis but further performed also a sensitivity analysis assessing alternative endpoints throughout all four studies which showed very similar association, regardless of endpoint
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Various endocrine therapies work by different mechanisms to antagonize the growth-promoting activity of estrogen and different endocrine therapies are administered to pre-menopausal and post-menopausal women.
0	NA	ARo	NA	DISCUSS	In our study we combined anti-estrogen, aromatase inhibitor and LHRH agonist treatments in order to gain more statistical power.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, the most common endocrine treatment regimen in all the three datasets was tamoxifen and a similar result was found specifically within the tamoxifen-treated subgroup
0	breast cancer	POSH	NA	DISCUSS	The direction of the association was consistent across the studies and remained statistically significant in the study-stratified pooled analyses even though patients in HEBCS GWS had relatively later onset breast cancer and POSH GWS contains only early-onset breast cancer patients.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Furthermore, the age-adjusted multivariate analysis suggests that the treatment interaction was not affected by the patients' age.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In stage I we could specifically assess also the ER-positive patients not treated with endocrine therapy which allowed us to elucidate whether the association is linked to ER positivity or endocrine treatment.
0	NA	NA	rs8113308	DISCUSS	The significant interaction between endocrine treatment and rs8113308 among ER-positive patients provided strong evidence that the identified association links specifically and significantly to endocrine treatment subgroup
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Based on HapMap, 27% of the population carries at least one allele of this SNP and 3% carry the homozygous genotype.
0	NA	POSH	NA	DISCUSS	In HEBCS GWS, POSH GWS and POSH validation, 26%, 22% and 25% of the cases carried at least one allele (HR = 2.16) and 2.11%, 2.06%, 2,35% were homozygous carriers, respectively, (HR = 7.17).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Previously, Kiyotani and colleagues performed a GWAS to assess the genetic factors influencing survival among patients receiving adjuvant tamoxifen therapy in Japanese population.
0	NA	NA	rs10509373	DISCUSS	They reported significant association with recurrence-free survival for SNP rs10509373 at 10q22 utilizing 240 patients in GWAS and 105 and 117 patients in the replication phase.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We did not find any significantly associated SNPs on chromosome 10, but because of the differences in allele frequencies comparison between the two studies is difficult
1	NA	ZNF613	rs8113308	DISCUSS	The SNP rs8113308 is located on the long arm of the chromosome 19, in intron five of a gene ZNF613 encoding for Zinc Finger Protein 613.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The 100kb flanking region harbours a multitude of zing finger genes.
0	NA	ZBRK1	rs11881650	DISCUSS	The cis-eQTL analysis indicated an association between rs11881650 (a tag SNP for rs8113308; r2 = 0.81) and mRNA levels of ZNF350 (also known as ZBRK1) as well as trans eQTL associations to EPS8L1, ZNF347 and CYP26A1.
0	NA	ZBRK1	rs8113308	DISCUSS	However, a tag SNP (r2 = 0.85) for rs8113308 locates in an active promoter site which is specifically active in mammary epithelial cells with the closest annotated gene being ZNF350; only ZNF350 showed gene expression-based survival difference among ER-positive tamoxifen-treated patients, with the high ZNF350 expression associating with poor survival.
0	cancers	NA	rs11881650	DISCUSS	When investigating the correlation of the tag SNP rs11881650 genotypes and RNA expression in ER-positive tumorous breast tissue we found that the rare allele correlated with increased ZNF350 mRNA expression levels.
0	breast cancer	ZBRK1	rs8113308	DISCUSS	Together these data indicate that the rs8113308 rare allele associates with increased expression of ZNF350 and poor survival of breast cancer patients after endocrine treatment
0	NA	ZBRK1	NA	DISCUSS	In a network analysis with a high confidence score we saw an interplay with ZNF350, RNF11, GADD45A and BRCA1, with the two latter interacting with ER (Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	S6).
0	Carcinoma	ZBRK1	NA	DISCUSS	ZNF350 expression is altered in different human carcinomas including breast cancer.
0	NA	ZBRK1	NA	DISCUSS	Zinc Finger Protein 350 can bind GADD45A in a BRCA1-dependent manner as well as via binding sites located in the GADD45A promoter region, suggesting that ZNF350 represses GADD45A expression via multiple binding sites.
0	NA	ZBRK1	NA	DISCUSS	The overexpression of ZNF350 has been shown to cause a decrease in both GADD45A transcripts and protein.
0	arrest	GADD45A	NA	DISCUSS	GADD45A takes part in several cellular processes, including cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.
0	NA	GADD45A	NA	DISCUSS	Functional assays on GADD45 family proteins, including GADD45A, have shown that they bind to nuclear hormone receptors including ER alpha and act as nuclear co-activators.
0	breast cancer	GADD45A	NA	DISCUSS	Recently it has also been found that high level of GADD45A protein expression correlates with ER-positivity and low level with ER-negativity in breast cancer.
0	NA	GADD45A	NA	DISCUSS	Since aberrant expression of cell cycle regulators has been suggested to contribute to tamoxifen resistance it could be hypothesised that altered expression of GADD45A might have an effect on endocrine treatment response.
0	NA	GADD45A	NA	DISCUSS	Moreover, the role of GADD45A as co-activator of ER alpha could affect the antagonist effect of endocrine treatments that block the estrogen receptor binding, e.g.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	tamoxifen.
0	breast cancer	ZBRK1	rs8113308	DISCUSS	The biological rationale behind the identified association of rs8113308 and breast cancer outcome after endocrine treatment might thus be the altered ZNF350 expression levels and subsequent alterations in the expression and activity of GADD45A and its interacting partners, including ER alpha, but further studies are required to elucidate the actual mechanism
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis of two genome-wide studies and two validation sets to assess the genetic factors influencing survival for breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant endocrine treatment among women of European descent.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	It should be noted that our findings do not reach genome-wide significance as such, despite our use of GWAS as a starting point.
0	cancers	NA	rs8113308	DISCUSS	However, the results are supported by the significant statistical interaction between the rs8113308 and endocrine treatment among patients with ER-positive tumors, indicating a predictive, treatment-specific effect on survival, independent of conventional prognostic markers, as well as by consistent in silico functional findings and a biological rationale.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Pending further validation in other large datasets, our findings may potentially influence personalized treatment by identifying patients who would not benefit from endocrine treatment.
