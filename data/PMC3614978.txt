0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	To discover susceptibility genes of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), we conducted a 3-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) using three populations: Japanese from the Japanese Genetic Consortium for Alzheimer Disease (JGSCAD), Koreans, and Caucasians from the Alzheimer Disease Genetic Consortium (ADGC).
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	In Stage 1, we evaluated data for 5,877,918 genotyped and imputed SNPs in Japanese cases (n = 1,008) and controls (n = 1,016).
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	ABSTRACT	Genome-wide significance was observed with 12 SNPs in the APOE region.
0	NA	sortilin-related receptor L(DLR class A) repeats-containing	rs3781834	ABSTRACT	Seven SNPs from other distinct regions with p-values <2x10-5 were genotyped in a second Japanese sample (885 cases, 985 controls), and evidence of association was confirmed for one SORL1 SNP (rs3781834, P = 7.33x10-7 in the combined sample).
1	Alzheimer's disease	sortilin-related receptor L(DLR class A) repeats-containing	rs11218343	ABSTRACT	Subsequent analysis combining results for several SORL1 SNPs in the Japanese, Korean (339 cases, 1,129 controls) and Caucasians (11,840 AD cases, 10,931 controls) revealed genome wide significance with rs11218343 (P = 1.77x10-9) and rs3781834 (P = 1.04x10-8).
0	Alzheimer's disease	PICALM	rs3851179	ABSTRACT	SNPs in previously established AD loci in Caucasians showed strong evidence of association in Japanese including rs3851179 near PICALM (P = 1.71x10-5) and rs744373 near BIN1 (P = 1.39x10-4).
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	The associated allele for each of these SNPs was the same as in Caucasians.

0	Alzheimer's disease	PSEN1	NA	INTRO	Multiple rare mutations in APP, PSEN1, PSEN2 and SORL1 account for most cases of early-onset autosomal dominant AD.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Risk of late-onset AD (LOAD), the most common type of dementia in the elderly, is associated with complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors.
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	INTRO	Until recently, APOE was the only unequivocally recognized major susceptibility gene for LOAD.

0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	To our knowledge, no large GWAS for LOAD has been performed in any Asian population.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Because there is a possibility that there exist ethnic-specific LOAD susceptibility variants, we carried out a large-scale GWAS to confirm associations at known loci and identify novel loci for LOAD using a three-stage design including a discovery Japanese cohort and replication cohorts of Japanese, Korean and Caucasian subjects

0	NA	apolipoprotein E	rs429358	RESULTS	In addition to APOE SNP rs429358 (P = 2.46x10-49, OR [95% CI]  = 5.5 [4.4-6.9]), 12 other SNPs in the APOE region were associated with LOAD at the genome-wide significance level of P<5.0x10-8.
0	NA	PVRL2	rs12610605	RESULTS	The two most significant results in this group of SNPs were rs12610605 (PVRL2: P = 1.38x10-13, OR [95% CI]  = 1.8 [1.5-2.0]) and rs62117161 (between CEACAM16 and BCL3: P = 3.46x10-12, OR [95% CI]  = 0.47 [0.38-0.58]).
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	RESULTS	Since imputation in the APOE region using the 1000 Genomes reference panel is unreliable, we genotyped nine SNPs from this region, spanning multiple linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks (Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	S3) and that were nominally significant in the APOE epsilon3/epsilon3 subgroup, in the Japanese discovery and replication samples using TaqMan assays (Table S2).
0	NA	PPP1R37	NA	RESULTS	Genome-wide significant results were obtained for five of these SNPs, but only the association with PPP1R37 SNP rs 17643262 remained nominally significant after adjustment for the number of APOE epsilon4 alleles (P = 3.96x10-4) or in analyses stratified by APOE genotype (epsilon3/epsilon3: P = 0.01; epsilon3/epsilon4: P = 0.0016)

0	NA	sortilin-related receptor L(DLR class A) repeats-containing	rs3781834	RESULTS	Subsequently, we selected an additional four SORL1 SNPs (rs3781834, rs2282647, rs17125523, and rs3737529) for testing in the Japanese replication sample that were among the most significant in the basic or extended models in the discovery sample (Table S1) and not in LD with rs4598682 (r2<0.2, Figure S4).
0	NA	NA	rs3781834	RESULTS	Two of these SNPs (rs3781834 and rs17125523) were chosen also because they were genotyped in the discovery sample and thus would minimize the effects of potential imputation artifacts in meta-analysis of the two Japanese samples.
0	NA	sortilin-related receptor L(DLR class A) repeats-containing	rs4598682	RESULTS	Highly significant results were obtained for SORL1 SNPs rs4598682 (P = 9.51x10-6), rs3781834 (P = 7.33x10-7), rs17125523 (P = 5.51x10-6), and rs3737529 (P = 4.14x10-6) after combining results from the discovery and replication samples (Table S3)

1	NA	sortilin-related receptor L(DLR class A) repeats-containing	rs11218343	DISCUSS	The two genome-wide significant SORL1 SNPs, rs11218343 and rs3781834 are located at chromosome positions 121,435,587 base pairs and 121,445,940 base pairs, respectively, and thus between the two previously reported strongly associated 3-marker haplotypes that extend upstream from rs641120 (121,380,965 base pairs) and downstream from rs1699102 (121,456,962 base pairs).
0	Alzheimer's disease	sortilin-related receptor L(DLR class A) repeats-containing	NA	DISCUSS	A recent meta-analysis including more than 30,000 Caucasian and Asian subjects demonstrated that multiple SORL1 SNPs in distinct regions are associated with AD, a finding substantiated in an association study of SORL1 SNPs with brain MRI traits in LOAD families.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	rs3781834	DISCUSS	Further analysis of our large Caucasian sample suggests that the association peak at rs3781834 is independent of at least one of the two distinct haplotypes previously associated with AD in an independent sample of non-Hispanic Caucasians, Caribbean Hispanics and Israeli-Arabs (Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	S5), Since all of the SNPs at the association peaks reported in this study and previously are intronic, functional studies are required to determine the identity of pathogenic variants at these locations
1	NA	NA	rs11218343	DISCUSS	Remarkably, the less frequent alleles at rs11218343 and rs3781834 are protective in both Japanese and Caucasian datasets with very similar odds ratios (range 0.74 to 0.83) despite the fact that these alleles are much rarer in Caucasians (4% and 2%, respectively) than in Japanese (34% and 23%, respectively).
0	Alzheimer's disease	sortilin-related receptor L(DLR class A) repeats-containing	NA	DISCUSS	The rarity of these SNPs in Caucasians, as well as allelic heterogeneity, may explain why SORL1 did not previously emerged as a genome-wide significant AD locus in much larger GWAS.
0	NA	sortilin-related receptor L(DLR class A) repeats-containing	rs3781834	DISCUSS	Given the discovery sample size, effect size (odds ratio [OR]  = 0.74) and MAF (0.23) of the top SORL1 SNP (rs3781834) in the Japanese sample, and a significance level of 2x10-5 (i.e., threshold for including a SNP in the Stage 2 replication phase), calculation of power post hoc using the PAWE-3D program confirmed that the discovery sample had sufficient power (83.7%).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	By comparison, the Caucasian sample of 22,771 subjects had only 52.8% power to detect association with this SNP at the observed significance level of 7.9x10-4 and OR (0.78) and a much lower MAF (0.02) than in Japanese
0	NA	PALM2	rs913360	DISCUSS	The most significant result in the GWAS in Japanese was obtained for PALM2 SNP rs913360 (P = 1.8x10-7), but this SNP was not significant in the Japanese replication sample (P = 0.16) and the result for the combined Japanese datasets was less significant than in the discovery sample (P = 6.6x10-6).
0	NA	PALM2	rs913360	DISCUSS	There was no evidence in the large Caucasian dataset supporting association for rs913360 (P = 0.38) or other PALM2 SNPs
0	Alzheimer's disease	PICALM	NA	DISCUSS	We obtained evidence in Japanese and Korean populations for association of AD with the same SNPs in the PICALM and BIN1 regions that were identified as genome-wide significant in multiple large GWAS in Caucasians.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	There are no previously reported association studies of these loci in Japanese.
0	NA	PICALM	NA	DISCUSS	Several small association studies of PICALM in comparatively smaller Chinese samples have yielded conflicting results.
0	NA	CR1	NA	DISCUSS	We also found nominally significant associations in the Japanese sample for previously associated SNPs in CR1, CLU, and ABCA7.
0	NA	EPH receptor A1	NA	DISCUSS	Lack of asociation with EPHA1, CD2AP, MS4A6A, and CD33 may be due to insufficient power, different linkage disequilibrium structure of these regions than in Caucasisans, locus heterogeneity or intragenic heterogeneity
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	DISCUSS	In addition, our analyses showed numerous highly significant results for imputed SNPs in the APOE region (including CEACAM/BCL3, PVRL2, TOMM40, and LOC284352) even after adjustment for the dose of the epsilon4 allele.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, recognizing that the reliability of imputation is poor for SNPs in this region, we genotyped 10 of the significant SNPs in the Japanese discovery and replication datasets.
0	NA	PPP1R37	NA	DISCUSS	Only one of these results, a PPP1R37 SNP, was nominally significant after adjustment for dose of epsilon4.
0	Alzheimer's disease	apolipoprotein E	NA	DISCUSS	Association of AD with this SNP, which is located approximately 225 kb from APOE, has not been observed previously.
0	NA	PVRL2	NA	DISCUSS	PVRL2 and APOE are located in a genomic region sandwiched between two recombination hotspots, where strong association signals for LOAD have been reproducibly detected in Caucasians, but dissipate almost completely for all non-APOE loci after conditioning on APOE, suggesting that no other loci in this region influence LOAD susceptibility.
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	rs7412	DISCUSS	This conclusion is consistent with the observation of moderate linkage disequilibrium between the SNPs determining APOE genotype, rs7412 and rs429358 (Fig.
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	DISCUSS	S5), SNPs showing genomewide significant evidence for association with LOAD without adjustment for APOE genotype, and our prior LOAD association studies with SNPs in this region among Caucasians

0	NA	sortilin-related receptor L(DLR class A) repeats-containing	NA	DISCUSS	It is expected that future large resequencing studies of SORL1 will identify the functional variants, thus providing important clues about the mechanisms governing normal and abnormal action of SorL1 on processes leading to LOAD.
0	Alzheimer's disease	sortilin-related receptor L(DLR class A) repeats-containing	NA	DISCUSS	The emergence of SORL1 as a genome-wide significant locus for AD confirms existing genetic and functional evidence and elevates the importance of intracellular trafficking involving retromer and the Golgi-to- endosome as a key pathway leading to AD
