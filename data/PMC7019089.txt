0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Use of individual patient data meta-analysis maximizes statistical power when combining information across multiple studies.
0	toxicity	to	NA	DISCUSS	In addition, we stratified our multivariable models by study to account for differences in toxicity incidence and other unmeasured covariates that may differ across study populations.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Analysis of previously identified risk SNPs provides support for the original discovery because the odds ratios, the best estimate of association, are in the same direction in the new studies.
0	toxicity	to	NA	DISCUSS	"As is commonly observed, the initial effect size estimates for the prior GWAS-identified SNPs were upwardly biased (so-called ""winner's curse""), and evaluation here enabled estimation of effect sizes that more likely reflect their true contribution to risk of toxicity."
0	NA	to	NA	DISCUSS	Although unable to replicate the association at 2q24.1 within TANC1, it is challenging because of the rarity of minor alleles within Europeans.
0	NA	to	NA	DISCUSS	However, ongoing laboratory studies support a role of TANC1 in radiation response (personal communication from Ana Vega, Universidade de Santiago de Compostela, Santiago de Compostela, Spain), highlighting the importance of functional studies as complementary to association studies
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The multivariable risk models demonstrate that genetic variants, treatment variables, and other clinical factors are independent predictors for radiotoxicity, supporting the suggestion that common variants can improve traditional normal tissue complication probability models.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Although the c-statistics for our models are modest, SNPs improved model performance.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	As cohort and sample sizes increase, further GWAS should uncover additional risk SNPs and sequencing studies will uncover rare, possibly high-penetrance, variants.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We foresee the eventual incorporation of polygenic scores or gene panel information into integrative models of radiotoxicity that also include clinical risk factors.
0	NA	to	NA	DISCUSS	Although important to continue efforts to identify additional risk SNPs and rare variants, our models are ready for validation, a critical next step toward clinical testing.

0	NA	to	NA	DISCUSS	In addition, investigators are actively developing novel clinical trial approaches for testing the ability of risk models to personalize treatment and improve outcomes.
0	toxicity	to	NA	DISCUSS	We foresee these models being used, for example, to identify the small proportion of individuals with the highest risk for toxicity who might choose to avoid radiotherapy if watchful waiting or surgery are alternatives; for dose escalation in patients with a low risk of toxicity; and to evaluate how model-directed modification of planned doses to normal tissues affects risk for developing toxicity
0	toxicity	to	NA	DISCUSS	A strength of our study is the prospective longitudinal assessment of toxicity enabling use of time-to-event analysis to maximize information across multiple toxicity assessments.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Long-term follow-up is clearly important for radiogenomic studies, and future work should use longitudinal analysis when possible.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	A second strength of our work is the inclusion of Japanese ancestry cohorts.
0	NA	to	NA	DISCUSS	Most GWAS to date focused on populations of European ancestry, because ethnicity inflates type I error rates and reduces statistical power because of population heterogeneity in allelic effects on a trait.

0	NA	to	NA	DISCUSS	Methods are being developed to detect genetic variants associated with complex traits allowing for population heterogeneity.
0	NA	to	NA	DISCUSS	Transethnic studies suggest susceptibility loci for traits are generally shared between European and East Asians, and, because of the larger sample size, cross-population meta-analyses increase statistical power to detect novel loci.
0	NA	to	NA	DISCUSS	Our cohort sizes are still too small to identify heterogeneity in allelic effects between ethnic groups.
0	toxicity	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, we performed the first analysis exploring transferability of SNP-radiotherapy toxicity associations across ethnicities
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Limitations include the lack of detailed dosimetry and comorbidity data for all cohorts, although our stratified analysis maximized use of data across all studies for multivariable models.
0	toxicity	to	NA	DISCUSS	In addition, although this is the largest GWAS of its kind to date, the sample size is modest compared with disease susceptibility GWAS and was powered only to detect SNP-toxicity associations with relatively large effect sizes.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our study was too small for multi-SNP modeling, such as polygenic risk score and machine learning-based methods.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The latter were successful for other polygenic traits and diseases and should be reevaluated as larger radiotoxicity cohorts become available.
0	toxicity	to	NA	DISCUSS	In addition, this study was not designed to identify rare variants associated with radiotherapy toxicity, which requires next-generation sequencing of large cohorts or case-control studies
