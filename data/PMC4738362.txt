0	Type 2 diabetes	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 80 susceptibility loci for type 2 diabetes (T2D), but most of its heritability still remains to be elucidated.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis of GWAS for T2D in the Japanese population.
1	NA	CCDC85A	rs1116357	ABSTRACT	Combined data from discovery and subsequent validation analyses (23,399 T2D cases and 31,722 controls) identify 7 new loci with genome-wide significance (P<5 x 10-8), rs1116357 near CCDC85A, rs147538848 in FAM60A, rs1575972 near DMRTA1, rs9309245 near ASB3, rs67156297 near ATP8B2, rs7107784 near MIR4686 and rs67839313 near INAFM2.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Of these, the association of 4 loci with T2D is replicated in multi-ethnic populations other than Japanese (up to 65,936 T2Ds and 158,030 controls, P<0.007).
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	These results indicate that expansion of single ethnic GWAS is still useful to identify novel susceptibility loci to complex traits not only for ethnicity-specific loci but also for common loci across different ethnicities

0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	By doing so, this study shows that both ethnicity-specific and ethnically-shared genetic loci can contribute to T2D risk
0	Type 2 diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	To date, more than 80 susceptibility loci for type 2 diabetes (T2D) have been identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	However, the joint effects of these variants account for <10% of the heritability for T2D.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	GWAS for T2D have been extensively conducted in populations of European descent and, accordingly, the majority of established T2D susceptibility genetic loci were originally identified by European GWAS.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Cumulative evidence suggests that Asian populations may be more genetically susceptible to T2D than populations with European ancestry.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In addition, there are significant interethnic differences in the risk allele frequency or in effect sizes at several loci, which may affect the power to detect associations in these populations.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	On the other hand, both overlap in T2D susceptibility loci among different ancestry groups and coincident risk alleles at lead single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across diverse populations have been reported, suggesting that causal variants at many of these loci are shared across different ancestry groups.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Moreover, a recently published transethnic GWAS has successfully identified seven novel T2D susceptibility loci by combining the association data from European, South Asian, East Asian and Mexican/Latinos GWAS.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Therefore, it is valuable to perform GWAS for T2D using non-European and European populations, to facilitate identification of both ethnicity-specific and common-susceptibility loci among different ethnic groups
1	NA	KCNQ1	NA	INTRO	Four T2D GWAS loci discovered in a Japanese population earlier have been shown to be significantly associated with T2D in the largest European GWAS meta-analysis: KCNQ1 (refs), UBE2E2 (ref.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	), C2CD4A-C2CD4B and ANK1 (ref.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	), highlighting that there are common loci conferring susceptibility to T2D among the different ethnic groups studied.
0	NA	GPSM1	NA	INTRO	Three additional loci (MIR129-LEP, GPSM1 and SLC16A11-SLC16A13) have been identified by a large-scale Japanese GWAS (n=~25,000) based on the imputation of genotypes using the 1000 Genomes Project data as a reference.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	One of the findings, the association in the SLC16A11-SLC16A13 was also confirmed in the Mexican GWAS study
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	To identify novel loci for susceptibility to T2D, we have expanded the Japanese GWAS data set by incorporating new Japanese GWAS data (9,817 T2D cases and 6,763 controls) with GWAS data in previously reported case-control individuals (5,646 T2D cases and 19,420 controls) followed by a validation study using independent Japanese case-control individuals (7,936 T2D and 5,539 controls) and multi-ethnic replication studies (East Asians: 12,554 T2D and 17,383 controls; Europeans: 38,947 T2D and 121,903 controls; South Asians: 10,587 T2D and 14,378 controls; and Mexian/Latinos: 3,848 T2D and 4,366 controls).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	As a result, we identify seven novel loci for T2D and the result indicates that expansion of single ethnic GWAS is still useful to identify novel susceptibility loci to complex traits
0	NA	set1	NA	RESULTS	Imputed genotype dosage data for 9,817 T2D cases and 6,763 controls for 7,521,072 autosomal SNPs (Stage-1, set-1) were obtained and combined with an independent GWAS data of previously reported case-control individuals (Stage-1, set-2: 5,646 T2D cases and 19,420 controls; 7,521,072 autosomal SNPs), as shown in Fig.

1	NA	KCNQ1	rs2237896	RESULTS	The most significant association in this meta-analysis was rs2237896 located at intron 15 of KCNQ1 (P=2.81 x 10-70), which was previously identified in Japanese GWAS (Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	1C).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Out of the 42 loci, 25 were previously established T2D susceptibility loci (Supplementary Table 1) and the remaining 17 were further evaluated using an independent Japanese case-control study (Stage-2: 7,936 T2D cases and 5,539 controls, multi-centre) and de novo genotyping (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3)
0	NA	set1	NA	RESULTS	To explore the novel T2D susceptibility loci, we combined the association data for the candidate SNPs from all the Japanese case-control samples (Stage-1 set-1, Stage-1 set-2 and Stage-2) using a meta-analysis (Fig.

1	NA	CCDC85A	rs1116357	RESULTS	2 and Supplementary Table 3): rs1116357 near CCDC85A (P=6.97 x 10-10, odds ratio (OR)=1.09, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.06-1.12), rs147538848 in FAM60A (P=7.83 x 10-10, OR=1.11, 95% CI=1.07-1.15), rs1575972 near DMRTA1 (P=1.50 x 10-9, OR=1.19, 95% CI=1.13-1.26), rs9309245 near ASB3 (P=1.25 x 10-8, OR=1.10, 95% CI=1.07-1.14), rs67156297 near ATP8B2 (P=1.95 x 10-8, OR=1.14, 95% CI=1.09-1.19), rs7107784 near MIR4686 (P=2.07 x 10-8, OR=1.14, 95% CI=1.09-1.20) and rs67839313 near INAFM2 (P=2.42 x 10-8, OR=1.09, 95% CI=1.06-1.12).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The effect sizes (OR) of these seven SNPs were similar before and after adjusting for age, sex and body mass index (BMI) (Supplementary Table 4).
1	NA	DMRTA1	rs1575972	RESULTS	The rs1575972 locus in DMRTA1 was located 170 kbp away from the T2D locus CDKN2A/B at 9p21 (refs) and the rs7107784 locus near MIR4686 was located ~620 kbp upstream of KCNQ1 (refs).
1	NA	CDKN2A	rs1575972	RESULTS	The linkage disequilibrium (LD) between rs1575972 and rs10811661, which was a lead SNP within the CDKN2A/B locus, was weak (JPT: r2=0.01, CEU: r2=0.02).
1	NA	CDKN2A	rs1575972	RESULTS	The association of rs1575972 was significant even after conditioning on rs10811661 (P for meta-analysis=2.45 x 10-9, OR=1.19, 95% CI=1.12-1.26; Supplementary Table 5); therefore, we considered the rs1575972 locus as a novel T2D susceptibility locus, independent of the CDKN2A/B locus.
1	NA	MIR4686	rs7107784	RESULTS	We also observed that the rs7107784 locus near MIR4686 was not in LD with rs2237897 (JPT: r2<0.01, CEU: r2<0.01), which was a lead SNP within the KCNQ1 locus, and the association was similar after conditioning on rs2237897 (P for meta-analysis=2.75 x 10-8, OR=1.16, 95% CI=1.10-1.22; Supplementary Table 6)
0	NA	insulin	NA	RESULTS	We also examined the association of these seven SNPs with glycaemic traits in Stage-2 control individuals, including fasting plasma glucose, homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) of beta-cell function (HOMA-beta) and HOMA of insulin resistance (IR).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	However, we did not detect any significant associations between the T2D risk alleles and these glycaemic traits (P>=0.0024 Supplementary Table 7).
1	NA	DMRTA1	NA	RESULTS	We also searched the publicly available European GWAS data (MAGIC, http://www.magicinvestigators.org) and found that the T2D risk allele at the DMRTA1 locus (rs11791293-C; proxy for rs1575972-T, CEU r2=1) and at the MIR4686 locus (rs7111341-T; proxy for rs7107784-G, CEU r2=0.95) were associated with a decrease in fasting plasma insulin (FPI) (P=0.0039; Supplementary Table 8) and with an increase in FPI (P=0.0066; Supplementary Table 8), respectively, although these associations were not statistically significant (P>=0.0008=0.05/63 (7 SNPs x 9 traits))
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We analysed the association of these seven variants with disease susceptibility in populations other than Japanese.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We obtained association data for four ethnic groups using de novo genotyping, in silico replication and by examining publicly available GWAS data including East Asian (n=up to 29,937: 12,554 T2Ds and 17,383 controls), South Asian (n=up to 24,965: 10,587 T2Ds and 14,378 controls), European (n=up to 160,850: 38,947 T2Ds and 121,903 controls) and Mexican (n=up to 8,214: 3,848 T2Ds and 4,366 controls) populations (Supplementary Table 9).

0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We did not detect any disease association for the remaining two SNP loci other than in the Japanese population; however, the effect direction for each of the seven loci was consistent with that in the Japanese population
0	obese	NA	NA	RESULTS	We performed BMI-stratified (BMI<25 or>=25) and sex-stratified analyses in the novel and established GWAS loci, to determine whether significant heterogeneity in allelic effects existed between non-obese and obese individuals or males and females in the Japanese population.

0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We applied the genetic information from previously reported and the present GWAS, to investigate potential drug targets for the treatment of T2D.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	First, we defined 286 T2D potential risk genes located in any of the 90 T2D risk loci (7 novel T2D loci that were identified in the present study and 83 previously identified T2D loci; see Supplementary Note).

0	intrauterine growth retardation	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Studies using a rat intrauterine growth retardation model have suggested that the Sin3/HDAC1 complex may negatively regulate the expression level of pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX1), which is known as an important transcription factor for the development of pancreas and beta-cell maturation via histone modification of its proximal promoter.
1	NA	FAM60A	NA	DISCUSS	A T2D risk allele at the FAM60A locus might contribute to disease susceptibility by impairing the transcriptional regulation of genes that are important for glucose metabolism
1	NA	INAFM2	NA	DISCUSS	INAFM2 encodes InaF-motif containing 2 and has previously been known as Osteogenesis upregulated transcript 1 (OGU1) or long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 984 (LINC00984), which is a putative long non-coding RNA.

0	glucose metabolism alterations	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Therefore, it is feasible that this locus is associated with impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion machinery.
0	NA	DISP2	NA	DISCUSS	DISP2 encodes dispatched homologue 2, which is a cell surface marker on insulin-positive cells.
0	glucose homeostasis	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Although the functional role of this molecule in glucose homeostasis is not well understood, it is potentially involved in the maturation of pancreatic beta-cells or it might have a role in already matured pancreatic beta-cells
1	NA	DMRTA1	rs1575972	DISCUSS	The effect size for the T2D association of rs1575972 near DMRTA1 was similar among all populations in this study, except for the Mexican/Latino population (Table 2 and Supplementary Table 10).
1	pancreatic	DMRTA1	rs1575972	DISCUSS	The risk allele of rs1575972 in the DMRTA1 locus was nominally correlated with a decrease in FPI (Supplementary Table 8), which suggests that this locus might contribute to T2D susceptibility through affecting insulin secretion in pancreatic beta-cells.
1	NA	DMRTA1	NA	DISCUSS	The DMRTA1 encodes doublesex and mab-3-related transcription factor-like family A1, which has been recently reported to be involved in neuronal development by regulating the Pax6-Neurog2 transcriptional cascade.
1	pancreatic	DMRTA1	NA	DISCUSS	Although the relevance of DMRTA1 to pancreatic development has not been established, DMRTA1 might play a role in beta-cell development, because Pax6 and Neurog3, other member of the neurogenin subfamily, are key transcriptional regulators of pancreatic endocrine cell differentiation

0	growth retardation	IGF2	NA	DISCUSS	IGF-2 plays a key role in embryonic growth and may also influence body weight in adulthood, and TH (tyrosine hydroxylase) has been shown to play a role in beta-cell development.
1	insulin-treated diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This locus is known to be associated with risk of type-1 diabetes (rs1004446-C, 45 kbp from rs7107784; r2=0.003, D'=0.275).
1	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The risk allele of rs7107784-G is nominally associated with the increase of FPI levels in the European population (MAGIC data; Supplementary Table 8) and an increase of HOMA-IR in our Japanese data set (Supplementary Table 7).
1	Neurological and Communication Disorders	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This suggests that the effects of rs7107784-G are probably not mediated by an impairment of insulin production or secretion, but rather by an impairment of insulin sensitivity

1	NA	ATP8B2	NA	DISCUSS	The role of ATP8B2 in the pathogenesis of T2D has not been established.
0	obese	atp10a	NA	DISCUSS	However, another member of the P4 ATPase family, atp10a, has been shown to be important for the biogenesis and/or membrane-directed trafficking of Glut4 receptors, and loss-of-function of atp10a induces IR and obesity in mice
1	NA	CCDC85A	rs1116357	DISCUSS	The remaining two loci, rs1116357 near CCDC85A and rs9309245 near ASB3, were not associated with T2D (P>0.05) in the replication meta-analysis for non-Japanese populations, which suggests that the effect of these loci might be specific to the Japanese population.
1	NA	NA	rs1116357	DISCUSS	As heterogeneity in effect sizes was observed for rs1116357 or rs9309245 between Japanese and other ethnic groups, including European, South Asian and Mexican (Supplementary Tables 25 and 27), two possibilities might exist for the two SNP loci: (1) the LD between the causal alleles and the Japanese lead SNPs are consistent across the populations, but the risk alleles have effects only in the Japanese, and (2) the causal alleles are in LD with these SNPs only in the Japanese.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	By a systematic evaluation for effect sizes and LDs within these loci, we did not identify any SNPs associated with T2D in European populations, which are in LD with our lead SNPs in the Japanese, whereas not in LD in European populations (Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	8 and Supplementary Tables 26 and 27).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Therefore, the causal allele in the two loci might have an effect only in Japanese populations; however, further evaluation is required to elucidate the precise mechanism how these loci contribute to T2D susceptibility in the Japanese
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	While searching for potential drug targets for T2D using a systematic bioinformatics approach, 83 overlapping genes were identified from 752 genes (40 biological T2D GWAS genes and 712 genes that encode products in direct PPI with 40 biological T2D GWAS genes) and 871 drug target genes for various human diseases.
0	NA	PPARG	NA	DISCUSS	Of these, 5 were T2D GWAS genes: PPARG, KCNJ11, ABCC8, GCK and KIF11.

0	cancers	KIF11	NA	DISCUSS	KIF11, which encodes kinesin family member 11 (also known as EG5), has been shown to be involved in regulating cell mitosis and inhibitors targeting this gene product have been developed as chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of cancer.
0	NA	KIF11	NA	DISCUSS	Although the role of KIF11 in the regulation of glucose metabolism has not been well established, a recent study reported that knockdown of KIF11 using small interfering RNA resulted in increased glycogenesis in human primary hepatocytes.
0	glucose homeostasis	KIF11	NA	DISCUSS	Thus, a KIF11 inhibitor might ameliorate glucose homeostasis by suppressing gluconeogenesis from the liver
0	NA	GSK3B	NA	DISCUSS	We identified two genes, GSK3B and JUN, which directly interact with multiple biological T2D susceptibility genes.
0	NA	GSK3B	C for 48	DISCUSS	GSK3B encodes glycogen synthase kinase 3beta, which is a constitutively active multifunctional serine/threonine kinase and is involved in diverse physiological pathways, including metabolism, cell cycle regulation, gene expression, development, oncogenesis and neuroprotection.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Several studies using Gsk3b-modified mouse models have suggested that inhibition of GSK3B function may have beneficial effects on glucose metabolism through pancreatic beta-cell preservation or enhancement of insulin-stimulated glycogen synthase regulation and glycogen deposition.
0	cancers	GSK3B	NA	DISCUSS	Currently, GSK3B inhibitors are under clinical trial for the treatment of cancers (Supplementary Table 23), but these compounds could also be potential treatments for T2D
0	NA	proto-oncogene c-Jun	NA	DISCUSS	JUN encodes the proto-oncogene c-Jun and the role of c-Jun in the pathogenesis of T2D is not well understood.
0	NA	proto-oncogene c-Jun	NA	DISCUSS	However, c-Jun has been shown to decrease the expression of the human insulin gene by repressing insulin promoter activity.
0	NA	proto-oncogene c-Jun	NA	DISCUSS	c-Jun is a transactivation component of the heterodimeric transcription factor AP-1 and activated through phosphorylation of serines 63 and 73 by Jun N-terminal kinase 2 (ref.
0	NA	MAPK8	NA	DISCUSS	), and inhibition of JNK has been shown to ameliorate glucose intolerance in a mouse model for T2D.
0	rheumatoid arthritis	proto-oncogene c-Jun	NA	DISCUSS	Currently, AP-1 inhibitor is under clinical trial for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (Supplementary Table 23) and might also be potential treatments for T2D
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Although these results suggest that these loci are potential therapeutic targets for treating T2D, the pipeline used to identify these genes has some limitations.
0	NA	eQTL	NA	DISCUSS	As eQTL effects have often been observed for genes far from each locus, it is possible that some biological genes located outside of LD block in each locus were overlooked.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In addition, the selection criteria for PubMed text-mining or knockout mouse studies were based on the known functions; therefore, T2D-associated genes whose functions have not been established may have been missed.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The number of criteria that were met for individual genes were simply summed for scoring, although the relative impact of the six criteria used here on biological significance may not be equal.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We used the previously described scoring method, to prioritize genes in an objective manner; however, it would be worthwhile to refine the pipeline by modifying the selection criteria for genes in future studies.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Finally, the potential therapeutic targets or treatments identified through the in silico pipeline have not yet been validated through an experimental approach.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Furthermore, in vivo evaluation is essential to clarify the therapeutic effect of these potential T2D treatments
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In conclusion, we have identified seven novel T2D susceptibility loci using a large-scale Japanese GWAS meta-analysis.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The T2D association for four of these was also observed in non-Japanese populations.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In addition, we have proposed several new potential pharmacological targets for T2D treatment using a systematic bioinformatics approach.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	These results indicate that expansion of single ethnic GWAS is still useful to identify novel susceptibility loci to complex traits not only for ethnicity-specific but also for common loci across different ethnicities.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Moreover, systematic approaches for integrating the findings of genetic, biological and pharmacological studies could be useful for developing new T2D treatments, although additional pipeline refinement would be required
