0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Prostate cancer (PCa) is a leading cause of cancer mortality in men.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In 2013, it is estimated that 238,590 men will be diagnosed with and 29,720 men will die from the disease.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Approximately 1 in 6 men will be diagnosed with PCa during their lives based on the current incidence rates.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The major recognized risk factors for PCa are increasing age, African ancestry and positive family history
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Genome-wide association (GWA) studies and follow-up studies have identified and replicated ~65 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with PCa in men of European descent.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Most of these studies have included primarily older PCa cases, reflecting the demographics of the disease as well as, in some cases, study design constraints.
0	cancers	NA	NA	INTRO	For most complex disorders, including common cancers, early age at diagnosis is a marker of heritable forms of the disease.
0	hereditary syndrome	NA	NA	INTRO	Among hereditary PCa families, disease is diagnosed 6-7 years younger than sporadic disease and the risk for PCa increases with decreasing age of affected family members.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Further, studies have suggested that men diagnosed with PCa earlier in life are more likely to die from their disease compared to men, with similar clinical features of disease, diagnosed at an older age.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	To assess the importance of common genetic variants to early-onset PCa, we performed a GWA study for early-onset PCa, defined here as PCa diagnosed prior to age 56 years, in 931 men of European descent who were diagnosed with PCa at an average age of 49.7 years and 4120 European descent controls.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	This study represents the largest GWA study to date focusing specifically on men with early-onset PCa

0	NA	NA	rs6983267	DISCUSS	A total of four variants in known regions of PCa association reached genome-wide significance: two 8q24 variants, rs6983267 (p = 9.5x10-9) and rs10505477 (p = 9.4x10-9), and two 11p15 variants, rs7126629, (p = 2.3x10-8) and rs7114836, (p = 3.7x10-8).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In addition to these loci, there was strong supportive evidence at a number of previously established PCa loci (Table 3).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	"Of note, for the established loci the observed odds ratios were comparable to the odds ratios in the initial discovery studies despite the likely upwards biased odds ratio estimates in the original reports, due to the ""winners curse"" phenomenon in SNP association discovery, and the use of female and unscreened male controls in the current study"
0	NA	NA	rs11839053	DISCUSS	In this report, we observed one novel significant association for chromosome 13 SNP rs11839053 based on HapMap Phase II imputation data (p = 8.7x10-10).
0	NA	NA	rs11843540	DISCUSS	We noted a strong discrepancy between results from HapMap Phase II (p = 1.0x10-9) and Phase III (p = 0.98) imputation results for neighboring SNP rs11843540, which is in strong LD with rs11839053 (R2 = 1.0 in HapMap Phase II CEU samples).
0	NA	NA	rs11839053	DISCUSS	Rs11839053 was not genotyped in HapMap Phase III samples.
0	NA	NA	rs11843540	DISCUSS	The strong discrepancy between results for rs11843540 based on Phase II and Phase III imputation data was the only noted major difference between these two data sets across all SNPs that were imputed using both reference samples; results were also highly concordant between genotyped and imputed SNPs (Spearman's correlations: 0.98, 0.98, 0.96, between results for Phase II vs. genotype, Phase III vs. genotype, and Phase III vs.

0	NA	NA	rs11839053	DISCUSS	We note that imputation qualities for rs11839053 and rs11843540 were relatively poor (r2~0.6 in all reference panels for each SNP), we observed little evidence for association (all p>0.001) for any directly genotyped SNPs in the 500 kb region immediately surrounding the two SNPs, and we did not observe any evidence for association at rs11839053 in our follow-up study of 2571 cases and 921 screened controls from JHU (Table 3).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	While our study using public controls appeared to have good overall control of type I error, any individual result should be considered suspect.
0	NA	NA	rs11839053	DISCUSS	It is unclear whether the result at rs11839053 in our GWA study is an artifact of using public control genotype data (i.e.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	"""batch"" effects for one or more genotyped SNPs in the region impacting imputation) or a true signal."
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Future studies will be necessary to confirm the association result before the locus should be considered a legitimate PCa locus
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We identified 12 additional novel regions that contained variants that had suggestive evidence for association (defined here as p<5x10-5).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	A representative SNP was chosen in each region and followed up in the JHU samples; no significant evidence supporting any of the results in the initial study were observed (Table 3).
0	NA	NA	rs8064701	DISCUSS	Arguably the most interesting result among these twelve loci was for chromosome 17q21-22 imputed SNP rs8064701 and nearby directly genotyped SNP rs7225566.
0	NA	HOXB13	NA	DISCUSS	Recently we discovered an uncommon missense variant, G84E/rs138213197, in HOXB13 that is associated with PCa.
0	NA	NA	rs138213197	DISCUSS	The G84E variant is ~1.2 Mb proximal to rs8064701 and rs7225566.
0	NA	HOXB13	NA	DISCUSS	Among the 931 cases in the current study (which were also included in the initial HOXB13 report), 23 (~2.5%) carried the variant allele at HOXB13.
0	NA	NA	rs138213197	DISCUSS	We performed long-range haplotyping using FastPhase2 and identified a single long-range haplotype that contained all 23 G84E variant alleles (a single case without the variant allele also was predicted to have the same long-range haplotype).
0	NA	NA	rs7225566	DISCUSS	The frequency of the minor (risk) allele for rs7225566 in the GWA study was 15% in cases and 11% in controls.
0	NA	HOXB13	rs138213197	DISCUSS	Fifteen of the 23 cases carrying the HOXB13 G84E risk allele also carried the minor/risk allele for rs7225566, including one homozygote.
0	NA	HOXB13	rs8064701	DISCUSS	These results suggest the observed nominally significant associations at rs8064701 and rs7225566 are partially due to linkage disequilibrium with HOXB13 G84E.
0	NA	NA	rs7225566	DISCUSS	While there was a slight increase in frequency of the rs7225566 risk allele in the JHU data (11% in cases versus 10% in controls), the result did not reach statistical significance.
0	NA	NA	rs7225566	DISCUSS	Finally, we note that rs7225566 is ~362 kb distal to rs7210100, an uncommon variant which was previously identified to be associated with PCa in a GWA study of African Americans.
0	NA	NA	rs7210100	DISCUSS	Rs7210100 was not directly genotyped or successfully imputed, due to the absence of Caucasian carriers in the HapMap reference panels, in our GWA study samples.
0	NA	NA	rs7210100	DISCUSS	The absence/rarity of the risk allele for rs7210100 in populations of European descent strongly suggests our finding at rs7225566 is independent of this previous reported variant.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Of note, as previously reported (Supplemental Material of Ewing et al.
0	NA	HOXB13	rs7210100	DISCUSS	), among 24 African American rs7210100 risk-allele carriers, none carried the HOXB13 G84E risk allele
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our initial discovery study included only publically available control genotype data in contrast to using a gold-standard age-matched screened control sample.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The UM-PCGP, being a family-based and case-only study, does not have access to an ideal large control sample from the same population as the cases.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Disease misclassification, which would likely occur at higher rates when using public control data, can cause a reduction in statistical power to detect truly associated genetic loci.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Most publicly available control genotype data come from studies with very limited information on PCa status.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	While there does exist publically available genetic data on PCa screened controls from previous PCa GWA studies, we elected to avoid using controls from these studies in order to obtain independent results.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We, and others, have shown that genetic association studies including larger numbers of unscreened controls generally have greater power for discovery than studies using a smaller number of screened controls provided the rate of disease misclassification is not high.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	For our primary analyses, we chose to include both male and female public controls over a control sample limited to unscreened males.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The prevalence of diagnosed PCa in European-American men under 56 years of age is less than 1%, thus the rate of disease misclassification for both our male and female public controls should not be that much larger than it would have been for age-matched screened controls from this age group
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The current study includes a large number of men with positive family history of disease (576/931 had a first or second degree relative with PCa).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Some of this enrichment was directly due to ascertainment criteria, but most is likely attributed to increased rates of disease, due to both genetic susceptibility and enhanced screening, in families with early-onset disease.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This study adds to the growing evidence that GWA study common variants play an important role in familial and early-onset PCa.
0	genetic diseases	NA	NA	DISCUSS	As new high-penetrant mutations are detected through next-generation sequencing, assessing the relative role of common risk variants and rare mutations to familial disease clustering will become an exciting area of research.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	For example, Karlsson et al.
0	NA	HOXB13	rs138213197	DISCUSS	recently showed that carrying a HOXB13 G84E mutation, which occurs at a frequency of ~1.3% in Sweden, is most strongly associated with hereditary (OR = 6.6) and early-onset (OR = 8.6) PCa and that the risk for G84E mutation carriers of developing disease is increased significantly for those carrying a higher burden of established common GWA study variants
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In conclusion, we describe results from the first stage of a two-stage GWA study for early-onset PCa.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our two-stage study design follows the strategy described by Ho and Lange, which increases the power of traditional case-control GWA studies by incorporating public control genotype data in the stage 1 discovery phase.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	As is the case for any study using public control data, care must be taken in interpreting any individual result due to factors such as batch genotyping effects and differential selective pressures across populations, which are difficult to completely control for experimentally or analytically.
0	NA	NA	rs11839053	DISCUSS	Our results provide proof of principal that such a study design is reasonable, given the strong evidence at a number of previously established PCa loci and the lack of evidence, with the possible exception of the chromosome 13 rs11839053 finding, for spurious results.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In total, our results provide compelling evidence supporting the importance of common genetic variants to early-onset PCa
