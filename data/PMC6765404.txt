0	syndromic	CRA	NA	INTRO	Standard chemotherapies for breast cancer damage the ovaries, causing temporary or permanent loss of menses (chemotherapy-related amenorrhea; CRA) in many young women.
0	amenorrhea	NA	NA	INTRO	Long-term amenorrhea has been seen in more than half of premenopausal women treated with chemotherapy for breast cancer.
0	Premature loss of ovarian function	NA	NA	INTRO	Premature loss of ovarian function can cause hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and bone thinning, and may contribute to other health risks
0	Loss of ovarian function	NA	NA	INTRO	Loss of ovarian function is a particular concern for women who wish to have biological children after their breast cancer treatment.
0	infertility	NA	NA	INTRO	As more women delay first child-bearing, and as potentially teratogenic adjuvant endocrine therapy durations increase for many patients, treatment-related infertility will be a growing problem.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Most women diagnosed with breast cancer in their 30s desire future pregnancies, but the birth rate of breast cancer survivors is only one third that of age-matched controls.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Because pregnancy after breast cancer does not increase cancer recurrence risk, and the ability to complete desired child-bearing is an important quality of life issue, newly diagnosed patients who are interested in pursuing future pregnancies are often offered oocyte or embryo cryopreservation.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Ovarian tissue cryopreservation is also used in this setting in some countries.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Some patients may instead decide to avoid chemotherapy if they strongly value future fertility
0	infertility	NA	NA	INTRO	Unfortunately, it is very difficult to individualize counselling regarding risks of infertility, or about the value of expensive and invasive fertility preservation procedures, because currently available methods for predicting who will maintain ovarian function after cancer treatment are inadequate.
0	Loss of ovarian function	CRA	NA	INTRO	Older age and more gonadotoxic regimens are well-recognized risk factors for loss of ovarian function, but there is significant individual heterogeneity in risk of CRA that is not accounted for by these factors
0	NA	CRA	NA	INTRO	Because age at natural menopause is highly heritable, and because more than 40 SNPs associated with age at natural menopause have been found through GWAS, we hypothesized that genetic variation may also be associated with CRA.

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Each of the genotyped batches was processed by a Mayo Clinic quality control pipeline that implemented the following filters: 1) removed unmapped SNPs, duplicate SNPs, SNPs on pseudoautosomal XY region, and mitochondrial SNPs; 2) removed SNPs with a call rate < 98%; 3) removed samples with a call rate < 95%; 4) removed SNPs with Hardy-Weinberg p values < 10-5; 5) removed duplicate samples detected by estimating identity-by-descent using King robust; 6) removed SNPs with minor allele frequency < 0.005; 7) removed samples where sex was inconsistent with X chromosome SNPs; 8) removed tri-allelic and small insertion/deletions before imputation; 9) used STRUCTURE software and 1000 Genome data as a reference to remove subjects that were not likely to have European ancestry (estimated probability of European ancestry < 0.7)
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Unmeasured genotypes were imputed by the University of Michigan imputation server.

0	nausea	NA	NA	METHODS	To explore whether the SNPs that were found to be associated with menses were likely to be involved in chemotherapy processing or ovarian reserve pathways, we examined the SNP associations with nausea, grade 3-4 leukopenia, and grade 3-4 neutropenia (adjusting for covariates used in the menses model)
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Of the 8,094 patients who enrolled in SUCCESS A/B/C, 1,675 were premenopausal and under age 45, and 1,168 had informative menstrual and genetic data.

0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We treated the combination of study and treatment arm as a stratification factor when evaluating the remaining covariates
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	In a multivariate model, node-negative disease was associated with increased chance of menses (RR=1.18, 95% CI 1.00-1.39, p= 0.05), while receipt of tamoxifen (RR=0.53, 95% CI 0.44-0.61, p = 5x10-15) and older age (age 41-45 vs. age <= 35 (RR=0.62, 95% CI 0.52-0.75, p = 5x10-7); age 36-40 years vs. age <= 35 (RR=0.77, 95% CI 0.62-0.95, p= 0.01) were associated with reduced chance of menses

0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	There were no other SNPs with suggestive associations (p<1x10-7) (Table 2; Figure 1)
1	NA	PPCDC	rs147451859	RESULTS	Review of rs147451859 functional annotation from HaploReg revealed no cis-eQTL associations for PPCDC, although cis- and trans-eQTL associations with multiple genes such as CA1 (carbonic anhydrase 1), SCAMP2 (secretory carrier-associated membrane protein 2), and MAN2C1 (mannosidase alpha class 2C member 1)/NEIL1(endonuclease VIII-Like 1) were identified in eQTL results from the Framingham Heart Study.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Although this variant overlaps predicted active enhancer regions in multiple tissue types, current evidence of regulatory impact is minimal (RegulomeDB score = 5)
1	NA	SLC20A1	rs17587029	RESULTS	Multiple eQTL association signals have previously been reported for rs17587029, including SLC20A1 (sodium-dependent phosphate transporter 1), ZC3H6 (zinc finger CCCH-type containing 6), and POLR1B (RNA polymerase I subunit B) in whole blood along with SLC20A1, CHCHD5 (coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain containing 5), POLR1B, and TTL (tubulin tyrosine ligase) in brain tissues.
0	allergy	PPAR-alpha	NA	RESULTS	This variant also overlaps an ENCODE DNAse hypersensitivity peak cluster and is predicted to disrupt a putative PPAR (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors) transcription factor binding motif (RegulomeDB score = 2b).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Further evaluation of cis-eQTL associations for both SNPs with the above-listed genes in the GTEx Project normal ovary samples (n=122) did not reveal any significant associations (all p > 0.05)

0	Premature loss of ovarian function	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Chemotherapy-related ovarian insufficiency impacts the fertility, menopausal symptoms, and potentially long-term health of many survivors of premenopausal breast cancer.
0	Loss of ovarian function	CRA	NA	DISCUSS	We confirmed previous findings that older age and tamoxifen use are associated with CRA, as well as the fact that age alone is not an adequate single predictor of post-chemotherapy ovarian function (given that approximately one third of those aged <=35 never resumed menses and more than half of those aged 41-45 did menstruate at least once after chemotherapy).
1	NA	NA	rs147451859	DISCUSS	Importantly, we found that two SNPs, rs147451859 on chromosome 15 and rs17587029 on chromosome 2, were associated with resumption of menses after chemotherapy
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	If confirmed, these SNPs may be included in models to better predict who will recover menses after chemotherapy, and to inform fertility preservation and cancer treatment decisions at the time of a premenopausal breast cancer diagnosis.
1	NA	NA	rs147451859	DISCUSS	The absolute increase in the likelihood of at least one menstrual period after chemotherapy was 12.1% for carriers of rs147451859 and 19.0% for carriers of rs17587029, and the absolute increase in likelihood of menses at any given time point was 18% for carriers of rs147451859 and 26.4% for carriers of rs17587029
0	Loss of ovarian function	NA	NA	DISCUSS	These loci may provide critical insights into the mechanisms underlying the inter-individual variation in loss of ovarian function and infertility in breast cancer survivors, though no functional studies were performed in this study.
1	nausea	NA	rs147451859	DISCUSS	Our finding that both rs147451859 and rs17587029 were also associated with less likelihood of nausea, grade 3-4 leukopenia, and grade 3-4 neutropenia suggests that at least part of the mechanism of their association with post-chemotherapy menses is via a role in general chemotherapy processing pathways.
0	toxicity	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In addition, this finding suggests that further investigation of the genetic predictors of hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities of chemotherapy could be fruitful, and this might eventually inform prophylactic management strategies (such as use of more aggressive anti-emetic medications starting with cycle 1 for those with an increased genetic risk of nausea, and/or prophylactic granulocyte colony-stimulating factor injections for certain patients receiving regimens that do not usually require that to maintain adequate white blood cell counts)
1	NA	PPCDC	rs147451859	DISCUSS	SNP rs147451859 is in an intron of PPCDC, which encodes a protein that is involved in the metabolism of water-soluble vitamins and cofactors.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This protein is necessary for the biosynthesis of coenzyme A.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	A molecule of coenzyme A carrying an acetyl group, acetyl-CoA, is a cofactor required for the drug metabolizing enzyme N-acetyltransferase.
0	NA	CRA	NA	DISCUSS	Therefore, variation in drug metabolism may be as important to CRA as ovarian reserve.
0	ovarian cell metabolism	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Alternatively or in addition, the impact of coenzyme A activity on ovarian cell metabolism may influence the susceptibility of this tissue to damage from chemotherapy
1	NA	NA	rs17587029	DISCUSS	rs17587029 is located 5'upstream of ribosomal protein S20 pseudogene 11 (RPS20P11).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Pseudogenes are presumed to be nonfunctional due to mutations and truncation by premature stop codons, but mutations in a pseudogene may still regulate the expression of other protein-coding genes.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Pseudogenes are known to regulate gene expression in mouse oocytes by impacting the RNA interference pathway.
1	NA	SLC20A1	rs17587029	DISCUSS	rs17587029 may regulate multiple nearby protein-coding genes, including SLC20A1.
0	cancers	SLC20A1	NA	DISCUSS	SLC20A1 is highly expressed in breast tissue, and tumor over-expression of SLC20A1 has been associated with poor clinical outcome in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer cases.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Further research will be needed to assess how RPS20P11 may affect ovarian reserve in humans
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	These findings are independent of GWAS signals associated with age at menarche or age at natural menopause.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Additional studies will be needed to confirm these findings.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	It will be important to assess whether any of the other SNPs that did not reach genome-wide significance in this analysis might be identified as significant in larger data sets.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Although it is difficult to obtain transvaginal ultrasound data, it would also be interesting to assess if these SNPs correlate with a low number of primordial follicles (a more direct measure of ovarian reserve) in healthy women, as well as before and after chemotherapy
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Limitations of this study include the relatively small sample size, missing menstrual data due to incomplete case report forms, and administration of GNRHa (which suppresses menses and limits our ability to understand menstrual patterns over time).
0	cancers	CRA	NA	DISCUSS	Future trials could facilitate more definitive studies of the genetics of chemotherapy-related amenorrhea by prospectively and rigorously collecting patient-reported menstrual data in premenopausal patients whose cancers will not be treated with GNRHa (e.g., those with hormonally insensitive cancers).
0	infertility	CRA	NA	DISCUSS	In addition, because chemotherapy-related amenorrhea is an imperfect surrogate for infertility, future research should assess the genetics of other biomarkers for infertility such as post-chemotherapy AMH levels
1	NA	PPCDC	NA	DISCUSS	In conclusion, we found a per allele 1.7-1.8-fold increase in likelihood of post-chemotherapy menses for SNPs in PPCDC and near RPS20P11.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	These SNPs help to identify who has a less than 40% versus greater than 60% chance of menses at any given time during the eight years following chemotherapy for breast cancer.
1	Loss of ovarian function	PPCDC	NA	DISCUSS	Confirmatory studies are ongoing, as are functional assessments of whether or not the PPCDC finding may be related to differences in coenzyme A activity that lead to more rapid metabolism of chemotherapies (and therefore less ovarian toxicity).
0	breast cancer	CRA	NA	DISCUSS	Further investigation of the genetics of CRA may inform individualized decision-making regarding breast cancer treatments (e.g., whether or not to receive chemotherapy for a small estimated reduction in risk of recurrence) as well as fertility preservation techniques
