0	AMD	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	We conducted a genome-wide association study in a series of families enriched for AMD and completed a meta-analysis of this new data with results from reanalysis of an existing study of a late-stage case/control cohort.
0	AMD	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	We tested the top findings for replication in 1 896 cases and 1 866 controls and identified two novel genetic protective factors for AMD.
1	NA	CFH	rs429608	ABSTRACT	In addition to the CFH (p=2.3x10-64) and ARMS2 (p=1.2x10-60) loci, we observed a protective effect at rs429608, an intronic SNP in SKIV2L (p=5.3x10-15), a gene near the C2/BF locus, that indicates the protective effect may be mediated by variants other than the C2/BF variants previously studied.

0	AMD	NA	NA	INTRO	Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of blindness in elderly populations worldwide.
0	AMD	NA	NA	INTRO	Clinically, AMD is a progressive disease, proceeding from the development of macular soft drusen and pigmentary abnormalities in early stages and culminating in vision impairing end stage forms, geographic atrophy and choroidal neovascularization.
0	AMD	NA	NA	INTRO	The etiology of AMD is multifactorial and includes modifiable risk factors such as smoking and diet in addition to genetic factors.
1	AMD	CFH	NA	INTRO	Recent efforts have strongly implicated variants in the complement cascade that modify AMD risk, with consistent evidence at the complement factor H (CFH), complement factor B (BF) / complement component 2 (C2) and complement component 3 (C3) genes.
1	AMD	ARMS2	NA	INTRO	Variants at the age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2 (ARMS2) locus have been shown to increase AMD risk as have variants in the mitochondrial genome, indicating a role for mitochondrial function in the pathogenesis of this condition
0	AMD	NA	NA	INTRO	Biological evidence also supports an immune-mediated mechanism for AMD pathogenesis.
1	AMD	CFH	NA	INTRO	In AMD, it is believed that the ability of CFH to inhibit the complement cascade is impaired, resulting in inflammatory damage to surrounding tissues.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Several lines of evidence support this mechanism.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Immunoglobulin and complement attack complexes are present in drusen, indicating complement activation even at earlier stages of disease.
1	choroidal capillaries	CFH	NA	INTRO	CFH is found locally in the eye, being observed in choroidal capillaries, in the subRPE space, and attached to Bruch's membrane, which underlies the RPE.
1	NA	CFH	NA	INTRO	The RPE itself also appears to be a local source of CFH.
0	NA	CFH	NA	INTRO	An aged CFH knockout mouse model exhibits increased accumulation of lipofuscin within the RPE that is likely to predispose to impairment in RPE cell function.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Despite this evidence, the question remains as to why the macula itself remains particularly susceptible to damage by the complement cascade and whether additional risk factors specific to the retina may remain to be discovered
0	AMD	NA	NA	INTRO	To identify novel loci and validate existing loci for AMD, we completed genome-wide association testing in a cohort of 161 controls and 377 cases with late AMD (Age Related Eye Disease Study; AREDS) in conjunction with a family-based genome-wide association scan (Family Age Related Maculopathy Study; FARMS) that assessed the entire spectrum of disease severity.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Examining patients with a range of endpoints enabled us to identify initiating events in disease pathogenesis in addition to confirming existing loci.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The strategy of using family-based cohorts, such as the SardiNIA and Framingham subjects, as discovery cohorts both alone and in combination with traditional case-control cohorts has proven a successful means to identify variants associated with disease in the general population.
0	AMD	NA	NA	INTRO	Our discovery efforts were followed up by replication in five case-control cohorts to determine which variants are most likely to contribute to AMD (Figure 1)
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Genome-wide association testing was completed in the FARMS and AREDS discovery sets.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Quantile-quantile plots of the observed distribution of corrected p-values versus the expected distribution (Figure 2) reveal a number of SNPs with p-values more significant than expected under the null hypothesis in the discovery cohorts.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	In AREDS, 51 SNPs were significant at p <= 10-4 (Table S4).
1	AMD	CFH	NA	RESULTS	Of these, 38 SNPs were located at previously identified AMD risk loci (CFH, ARMS2/HTRA1, C2/CFB).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Within FARMS, 35 SNPs were significant at the p <= 10-4 level.
1	AMD	CFH	NA	RESULTS	Five of these SNPs were located at the CFH locus; the remaining 30 SNPs were located in regions not previously implicated in AMD (Table S5)
1	NA	CFH	NA	RESULTS	All SNPs with p <= 10-4 in either the FARMS or AREDS cohorts as well as additional variants in CFH, ARMS2, C2/BF and C3 loci were advanced to replication in five Caucasian case/control cohorts.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Because other complement genes do not show significant evidence in our discovery cohorts at p <= 10-4 they were not assessed in our replication set.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	In addition to the previously known loci, we examined novel genes that among other functions have a role in vesicular and melanosome trafficking.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	SNPs were genotyped using a used a 768-SNP custom Golden Gate Illumina panel in 1896 cases and 1866 controls and tested for association using logistic regression
1	AMD	CFH	NA	RESULTS	At the two best known AMD risk loci, CFH and ARMS2, we observed strong association in both the discovery and replication cohorts (Table 1, Table S8).
1	NA	CFH	NA	RESULTS	We observed a broad signal of association across the CFH locus in all cohorts due to the presence of copy number polymorphisms and linkage disequilibrium (Figure S1).
1	AMD	CFH	T to C	RESULTS	The extensively studied non-synonymous CFH Y402H variant showed evidence of association (p = 4.0x10-42); however, a number of non-coding variants were more significantly associated with AMD.
1	AMD	NA	rs1329428	RESULTS	The most significant non-coding variant, rs1329428, appears to exert a protective effect on AMD risk (p = 3.2x10-64).
1	NA	ARMS2	NA	RESULTS	As the signal on chromosome 10q26 is distributed at two adjacent loci, ARMS2 and HTRA1, we characterized association at this extended locus using dense SNP coverage in our replication set (Figure 3, Figure S2).
1	NA	ARMS2	rs10490924	RESULTS	Strong evidence for single SNP association was observed at markers in the ARMS2 and HTRA1 genes (Table 1), with the best evidence at the ARMS2 A69S (rs10490924) coding variant (p = 1.2x10-60), at rs3750848, an ARMS2 intronic SNP (p = 8.1x10-60), and at rs3793917, a HTRA1 promoter polymorphism (p = 4.2x10-57).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	These three SNPs proved to be in tight disequilibrium in our cohorts (r2 > 0.91).
1	AMD	ARMS2	NA	RESULTS	To identify the SNPs at the ARMS2 locus that best account for the effect this region has on AMD risk, we completed a stepwise selection analysis in our the replication set using 33 markers spanning PLEKHA1, ARMS2 and into intron 3 of HTRA1.
1	NA	ARMS2	rs3750848	RESULTS	We found that the most parsimonious set consisted of two SNPs: rs3750848 in ARMS2 and rs2736917 in HTRA1 with the ARMS2 SNP entering the model first.
0	NA	NA	rs2736917	RESULTS	rs2736917 is in low LD with rs3750848 (r2 <= 0.04) and appears to represent an independent protective effect not previously reported
1	NA	ARMS2	NA	RESULTS	Our best evidence for association localized to a 14-kb region including ARMS2 and into the first intron of HTRA1.
0	AMD	NA	NA	RESULTS	We identified 11 markers spanning this region and tested haplotypes for association with AMD (Figure 3, Table S6).
1	NA	NA	rs10490924	RESULTS	From six haplotypes with a frequency greater than 1%, we identified one risk haplotype (OR = 2.6, p = 1.91x10-48) which contained the risk alleles at rs10490924, rs3750848 and rs3793917 (T-C-G) and four closely related protective haplotypes.
0	NA	NA	rs3750848	RESULTS	The selection of rs3750848 in our stepwise selection likely represents the association due to this haplotype.
1	NA	ARMS2	NA	RESULTS	Three of the core SNPs in our risk haplotype defined the earlier reported risk haplotype noted to carry an insertion/deletion polymorphism which affects RNA and protein expression of ARMS2.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	To determine the distribution of our risk haplotype in global populations, we examined phased haplotypes from the HapMap2 populations.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	A higher frequency of the risk haplotype was observed in Asians (JPT/CHB) (0.41) than in CEU (0.21) or YRI populations (0.19) (Figure 4).
0	AMD	NA	NA	RESULTS	The risk haplotype has a frequency between that of Caucasians and Asians in individuals of Indian descent, the Gujarati Indians in Houston (GIH) (0.33), indicating this population shares genetic risk factors for AMD with Asian populations.
1	NA	CFH	NA	RESULTS	We have demonstrated that the Asian genome has very few CFH risk haplotypes (T.A.S., unpublished data).
1	AMD	ARMS2	NA	RESULTS	Our results concur with findings described by DeWan et al that the ARMS2 region is likely the major genetic risk factor for AMD within Asian populations
0	AMD	NA	NA	RESULTS	Other strong effects for AMD have been reported at C2/BF and C3, factors that act as activators of C3 convertase in the classical and alternative complement pathways respectively.
0	NA	NA	rs641153	RESULTS	Similar to other studies, we observed a protective effect associated with the R32Q BF variant (p = 6.8x10-14), but also found strong signals at other marker loci (Table 1, Table S8, Figure 5).
1	NA	SKIV2L	rs429608	RESULTS	rs429608, an intronic SNP in SKIV2L, a gene close to BF, displayed the best evidence for association at this locus (p = 5.3x10-15).
0	NA	RDBP	rs438999	RESULTS	rs438999 in RDBP, a gene adjacent to BF, (p = 1.8x10-13) and rs550605 in C2 (p = 2.1x10-13) were also significant.
0	NA	NA	rs641153	RESULTS	Because R32Q was imputed in our data set, we verified the accuracy of imputation based on the HapMap CEU cohort, and found that our imputation was indeed highly accurate (88.2% concordance).
1	NA	NA	rs429608	RESULTS	Within the replication cohorts, rs429608 displayed only moderate disequilibrium with the R32Q variant (r2 ranging from 0.46 to 0.61) making it less likely rs429608 is merely acting as a proxy for the BF variant (Figure S5).
0	NA	NA	rs550605	RESULTS	rs550605 and rs438999 were in high LD both with each other and with R32Q (r2 >= 0.85).
0	NA	NA	rs641153	RESULTS	The high LD of these SNPs with R32Q provides additional confidence in the accuracy of the R32Q imputation since the results of association testing for these three SNPs was similar in magnitude.
1	AMD	CFH	NA	RESULTS	To determine whether these effects were independent from the effects of the CFH and ARMS2 loci on AMD, in our replication cohorts we adjusted for principal components that account for the majority of the SNP variation at CFH and ARMS2.
1	NA	NA	rs641153	RESULTS	Strong signals of association remained at R32Q (p = 1.8x10-10), rs429608 (p = 5.2x10-10), rs550605 (p = 4.1x10-10) and rs438999 (p = 1.3x10-9).
1	NA	CFH	rs641153	RESULTS	These findings provide evidence that the protective effect at this region is separate from the effects observed at CFH and ARMS2, and that variants other than the BF R32Q variant may contribute to this effect
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	To dissect the signal further we took the three most significant chromosome 6 findings and sequentially conditioned on the minor allele of each variant.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	None of the variants entirely accounted for the effect at this locus.
0	NA	C2	rs641153	RESULTS	The conditional results from rs641153 in BF and rs550605 in C2 were quite similar, as is expected given the high LD between these markers.
1	NA	SKIV2L	rs429608	RESULTS	Conditioning on either rs429608 in SKIV2L or rs641153 did not entirely eliminate the signal at the other SNP (Table S7).
0	NA	C2	NA	RESULTS	Haplotype analysis of 13 SNPs spanning from C2 to SKIV2L identified 5 common (frequency > 1%) haplotypes.
1	NA	NA	rs550605	RESULTS	We identified one highly protective haplotype, which harbored the C-A-G-A alleles at rs550605, rs641153, rs438999 and rs429608 (OR = 0.43, 95% CI = [0.32, 0.56]; p = 1.2x10-9) and another closely related protective haplotype (Figure 5, Table S6).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	One single risk haplotype was observed (OR = 1.36, 95% CI = [1.18, 1.57]; p = 1.9x10-5).
1	NA	NA	rs429608	RESULTS	Additionally, we identified a secondary protective haplotype (OR = 0.72, 95% CI = [0.55, 0.93]; p = 0.01) that was identical to our risk haplotype with the exception of the protective allele of rs429608.
1	NA	SKIV2L	rs641153	RESULTS	Thus, a haplotype harboring the risk allele of the BF R32Q polymorphism and the protective allele of SKIV2L rs429608 was found to be protective.
0	NA	C3	rs2230199	RESULTS	Of the two genotyped SNPs in C3, R102G also shows strong association in this study but was not pursued by further fine-scale mapping (p = 1.40x10-8)
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The strongest novel signal in our meta-analysis came from the family-based GWAS (Table 1, Table S8).
0	NA	MYRIP	NA	RESULTS	We identified a novel protective effect at MYRIP, a protein that enables the trafficking of melanosomes in the RPE.
0	NA	NA	rs11129874	RESULTS	The best initial signal was observed in the FARMS cohort at rs11129874 (p = 8.31x10-5).
0	NA	MYRIP	rs2679798	RESULTS	rs2679798, another variant in MYRIP, displayed the best evidence of association in meta-analysis (p = 2.9x10-4).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The rationale for the difference is that the family-based association may identify more highly penetrant rare variants.
0	NA	MYRIP	NA	RESULTS	We identified a risk and protective haplotype using the three MYRIP SNPs included in replication.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The haplotypes showed evidence for association similar to the individual SNPs indicating the three SNPs are capturing the same signal, likely due to high LD between them (r2 > 0.7).
1	AMD	MYRIP	rs2679798	RESULTS	The protective effect at MYRIP is independent of the effects of CFH and ARMS2 on AMD as the association remained following adjustment for CFH and ARMS2 variations using principal components (rs2679798, p = 0.001).
0	NA	MYRIP	NA	RESULTS	Given its biological function, MYRIP remains an interesting new candidate, despite not reaching genome-wide significance
0	NA	UNC13C	rs885203	RESULTS	In FARMS, UNC13C, a protein that regulates synaptic vesicle fusion, showed strong evidence for association (rs885203, p=2.2x10-5).
0	NA	UNC13C	NA	RESULTS	Variants in this gene did not show association within the population-based replication cohorts; however, UNC13C localizes to the 15q linkage region previously identified in the FARMS cohort.
0	AMD	UNC13C	rs10444833	RESULTS	Two other UNC13C variants, rs10444833 and rs11635375, were also associated with AMD (p=9.6x10-4, r2=1) and these variants account for a significant portion of the linkage signal mapping to this region (Figure S4)
1	AMD	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Genetic studies have identified strong effects in complement pathway genes and ARMS2/HTRA1 on AMD.
1	AMD	CFH	NA	DISCUSS	However, identification of major genes such as CFH and ARMS2 has not revealed why the macula, a region rich in cone photoreceptors, seems to be especially vulnerable to the AMD disease process.

1	AMD	CFH	NA	DISCUSS	Two genes linked to AMD in this paper, CFH and MYRIP, are now seen to share a significant role in melanosome trafficking or biogenesis, among other mechanisms.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Inappropriate trafficking of melanosomes impairs phagocytic and autophagic degradative processes in RPE cells, including the phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments, which is accomplished exclusively by the RPE and is critical for maintaining outer retinal integrity.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	RPE cells also protect the retina from reactive oxygen species that are generated in response to light exposure.
0	NA	MYRIP	NA	DISCUSS	A primary effect of RPE exposure to oxidative species is the generation of non-degradable byproducts such as lipofuscin, which contribute to the decline of RPE function with aging MYRIP may contribute to these protective effects by minimizing RPE reactive oxygen species exposure and, subsequently, the accumulation of lysosomal impairing oxidized complexes, preventing or delaying declines in RPE function.
0	AMD	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In this regard, it is interesting to note that progressive stages of AMD, particularly in the dry form, involve either retinal hyperpigmentation, or depigmentation.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Guo et al concluded that the absence of melanin increases RPE light absorption by ~20%.
0	AMD	NA	NA	DISCUSS	These observations together with our results suggest that melanosome trafficking may be under-appreciated as an important contributor to AMD, connecting essential functions of known genes, e.g.

0	AMD	SKIV2L	rs438999	DISCUSS	McKay et al earlier reported a coding SNP, R151Q, in SKIV2L as showing a significant protective effect for AMD (p=.0004), but could not ascertain if this effect was independent of BF R32Q with which it shares extensive LD (r2>=.95).
1	NA	SKIV2L	rs429608	DISCUSS	Our results indicate there may be a second independent effect at this locus and point to another SNP in SKIV2L, rs429608, or a SNP in very high LD, as the mediator of this effect.
0	NA	C2	NA	DISCUSS	Initial studies of this region focused exclusively on C2 and BF due to their roles in the complement pathway and did not extend their investigations to neighboring genes such as SKIV2L.
0	NA	C2	NA	DISCUSS	Future investigations should include variation beyond that found in the C2 and BF genes, as we have demonstrated non-C2/BF variants that may contribute to this region's protective effect

0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our re-analysis of the AREDS GWAS data identified 67 SNPs significant at p<=10-4 prior to genomic control correction, 24 of which were at potentially novel loci.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This represents a reduction in the number of novel SNPs significant at this threshold from the initial AREDS dbGaP data (58 novel SNPs).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The exclusion of non-Caucasian subjects and the inclusion of age into the regression models in our analysis may account for this difference.

0	NA	NA	rs9288410	DISCUSS	Similarly, rs9288410, the only novel SNP displaying association in the replication efforts of Zhang et al, did not meet our inclusion threshold and was not examined further
1	NA	CFH	NA	DISCUSS	Diverse populations have been examined for CFH and ARMS2 associations and it is evident that risk variants at these loci may not underlie disease to the same extent in populations of different ancestry.
1	NA	ARMS2	NA	DISCUSS	We observed that the frequency of the ARMS2 risk haplotype in the HapMap CEU, YRI, JPT and CHB and HapMap3 populations varied substantially.
1	NA	ARMS2	NA	DISCUSS	The ARMS2 risk haplotype is observed at a higher frequency in Asian populations than is seen in Caucasian and African counterparts.
1	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This finding corroborates the genomewide association results of Dewan et al., who observed association at the ARMS2/HTRA1 region, but not CFH in a cohort of Southeast Asians from Hong Kong.
1	NA	CFH	NA	DISCUSS	Recent observations indicate that the majority of Asians do not carry risk haplotypes at the CFH locus, while CFH risk haplotypes are common in Caucasians (T.A.S., unpublished data).
1	atrophy	CFH	NA	DISCUSS	It is not known whether these differences in genetic risk at CFH and ARMS2 may account for differences in the frequency and type (neovascular vs geographic atrophy) of late AMD profiles in Asians and Caucasians.
1	atrophy	ARMS2	NA	DISCUSS	Asians exhibit a predisposition for the development of exudative disease rather than geographic atrophy, implying perhaps ARMS2 variants may encourage progression to neovascular end stage disease whereas CFH variants promote geographic atrophy
1	NA	ARMS2	NA	DISCUSS	The core ARMS2 risk haplotype we identified corresponds to a haplotype reported to harbor an insertion/deletion polymorphism that affects ARMS2 expression.
1	NA	ARMS2	ARMS2 indel	DISCUSS	The initial report of the ARMS2 indel polymorphism found this variant to be in complete linkage disequilibrium with the ARMS2 risk haplotype (r2=1).
1	NA	NA	rs10490924	DISCUSS	However, further studies have identified individuals with the A69S risk allele that do not harbor the indel.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We genotyped the indel using PCR in 161 samples from several ethnic groups including individuals from the HapMap JPT and CHB populations and Caucasian and African American subjects from the Coriell Human Diversity Panels (Figure S3).
0	NA	NA	ARMS2 indel	DISCUSS	Our results indicate that the reported ARMS2 indel polymorphism resides on our identified risk haplotype.
0	NA	NA	rs3750848	DISCUSS	Our stepwise selection identified two SNPs, rs3750848 and rs2736917, which account for the effect at this locus.
1	AMD	ARMS2	rs3750848	DISCUSS	rs3750848 is an intronic variant in ARMS2 that resides in an LD block with the well characterized ARMS2 rs10490924 variant and with rs3793917, an HTRA1 promoter polymorphism, both of which were also highly associated with AMD in our cohorts.
0	NA	NA	rs3750848	DISCUSS	rs3750848 probably serves as a surrogate for our risk haplotype in the stepwise selection model and likely represents the effect of the indel.

0	AMD	UNC13C	NA	DISCUSS	While UNC13C did not show evidence for association in our case/control cohorts, rare variants may predispose to AMD in a subset of patients and require deep resequencing to identify
1	AMD	SKIV2L	NA	DISCUSS	In summary, our findings demonstrate that SKIV2L variants may underlie the protective effect at the AMD chromosome 6 locus and confirm known associations at CFH, ARMS2 and C3.
