0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Prostate cancer is the most common non-skin cancer in men in the Western world and epidemiological studies have shown strong evidence for genetic predisposition to prostate cancer, based on two of the most important factors, ancestry and family history.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 76 common risk loci (reviewed in ref ); however, over 1,000 additional common SNPs are estimated to contribute prostate cancer risk.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Previous prostate cancer GWAS have been conducted primarily in populations of European ancestry, with the majority of risk loci discovered also found to be associated with prostate cancer risk in other racial/ethnic populations.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The generalizability of risk associations for a large fraction of loci suggests that combining GWAS across ancestral populations could increase power to detect risk loci that are shared among diverse populations
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	To search for additional genetic risk factors for prostate cancer, we combined data from studies with existing high-density SNP genotyping in prostate cancer GWAS discovery or replication efforts in the following populations: European ancestry[34,379 cases and 33,164 controls from UK/Australia, Cancer of the Prostate in Sweden (CAPS), Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium (BPC3), PEGASUS, and iCOGS/PRACTICAL]; African ancestry[5,327 cases and 5,136 controls from the African Ancestry Prostate Cancer GWAS Consortium (AAPC)and the Ghana Prostate Study]; Japanese ancestry[2,563 cases and 4,391 controls from a GWAS in Japanese in the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC), and Biobank Japan]; and, Latino ancestry[1,034 cases and 1,046 controls from the MEC].

0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	For the 23 novel risk variants (15 in European, 7 in multiethnic and 1 in the early onset analysis), the per-allele effects ranged from 1.06-1.14 and were consistent with log-additive effects (Supplemental Table 11).
1	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	rs7153648	INTRO	The association of each variant was noted for both aggressive and non-aggressive prostate cancer (Supplemental Table 12); for only one variant, rs7153648 at 14q23, there was suggestive evidence of a difference by disease severity (OR=1.17 for aggressive and OR=1.09 for non-aggressive disease; Phet=0.03).
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	These results confirm what has been observed in prostate cancer GWAS to date; risk loci appear to confer risk for prostate cancer overall and not discriminate between the aggressive and indolent disease.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In analyses stratified by age, 17 of the 23 variants demonstrated larger effects at younger ages (<=55 versus >55 years), although only 6 had evidence of a significant difference (p<0.05) (Supplemental Table 9).

1	Breast and prostate cancer	TMPRSS2	NA	INTRO	Expression of TMPRSS2 is highly specific to prostate tissue and chromosomal translocation resulting in fusion of the TMPRSS2 promoter/enhancer region with the ETS transcription factors ERG and ETV1 are frequently observed in prostate cancer.

0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	For the sets of SNPs defined for men of European ancestry, 53-64% had ORs that are directionally concordant for African (p=0.04-0.003, dependent on the p-value threshold bin), Asian (p=0.31-0.02) or Hispanic men (p=0.04-0.002) with the ORs in Europeans.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	This same observation remained once we removed the 23 risk loci identified by the current study (Supplementary Figure 5).

0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Based on a polygenic risk score comprising these 100 variants for men of European ancestry (Online Methods), the top 10% of men in the highest risk stratum have a 2.9 fold (95% CI 2.8-3.1) relative risk of prostate cancer and the top 1% of men have a 5.7 fold (95% CI 4.8-6.6) relative risk compared with the population average (Supplemental Table 17).
0	NA	PSA	NA	INTRO	The top 10% is at a RR compared with the average of the population where it will be important to examine whether targeted screening based on family history genetic risk may reduce the over-diagnosis of indolent disease, which is a main limitation of PSA screening.
