0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Western countries, prostate cancer is the most prevalent cancer of men, and one of the leading causes of cancer-related death in men.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Several genome-wide association studies have yielded numerous common variants conferring risk of prostate cancer.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	In the present study we analyzed 32.5 million variants discovered by whole-genome sequencing 1,795 Icelanders.
1	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	rs188140481	ABSTRACT	One variant was found to be associated with prostate cancer in European populations: rs188140481[A] (OR = 2.90, Pcomb = 6.2x10-34) located on 8q24, with an average risk allele control frequency of 0.54%.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	This variant is only very weakly correlated (r2 <= 0.06) with previously reported risk variants on 8q24, and remains significant after adjustment for all of them.
1	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	rs188140481	ABSTRACT	Carriers of rs188140481[A] were diagnosed with prostate cancer 1.26 years younger than non-carriers (P = 0.0059).
1	Breast and prostate cancer	HOXB13	rs138213197	ABSTRACT	We also report results for the previously described HOXB13 mutation (rs138213197[T]), confirming it as prostate cancer risk variant in populations from all over Europe
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Risk of prostate cancer has been shown to have a strong genetic component.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Numerous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are registered in the Catalog of published Genome-Wide Association Studies (see URLs), where well over 40 prostate cancer susceptibility loci are listed.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	However, these risk variants, which were discovered using commercial genotyping chips, are common and each confers a moderate to low risk.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	New high-throughput whole-genome sequencing techniques allow for systematic search for rarer risk variants, that possibly also confer greater risk.
1	Breast and prostate cancer	HOXB13	NA	INTRO	An example is the recently published missense mutation in HOXB13 conferring high risk of prostate cancer.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Here, we report one additional independent variant located on 8q24 that is rarer and confers greater risk than previously published common prostate cancer risk variants
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	To search for prostate cancer risk variants, we analyzed data generated by deCODE's ongoing whole-genome sequencing project.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In short, the goal of this project is to sequence 2,500 Icelanders, to at least 10-fold coverage of the genome for each individual.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The variants (SNPs and INDELs) discovered in the sequencing phase are then propagated into chip-genotyped individual as well as into individuals without genotypic information, making use of the extensive genealogical information available in Iceland as well as phasing- and imputation methods previously described.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The association analysis in our study was done at a time point when 1,795 Icelanders had been sequenced to at least a ten-fold coverage.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The approximately 32.5 million variants discovered through whole-genome sequencing were imputed into 71,743 Icelanders who had all been genotyped using commercial Illumina SNP-chips as well as into 296,496 Icelanders without direct chip-genotypes but with family-based imputation genotype information (see Online Methods and Supplementary Note).
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Our list of prostate cancer patients contains 5,141 men diagnosed from 1955 until end of 2010; based on the nationwide Icelandic Cancer Registry (ICR; see URLs).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Of those, 2,315 patients had been genotyped using one of the Illumina chips, and 2,222 additional patients had at least partial data from family based imputation; leaving 604 of the total patient list with no genotypic information.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	As controls we used 54,444 males (27,780 had variants imputed based on chip-genotypes and 26,664 had variants imputed with a family based methods; see Supplementary Note) not diagnosed with prostate cancer according to the nationwide ICR
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	According to our analysis 252 variants were significantly associated with prostate cancer at P < 1.5x10-9 (a GWAS significance threshold applicable according to a Bonferroni correction of 32 million tests).
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	All these variants were located at the previously described prostate cancer risk loci on 8q24 and 17q12.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In order to search for novel risk variants at these two loci we used multivariate logistic regression
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	rs4430796	INTRO	When analyzing the 17q12 locus we adjusted for the variant rs4430796, the SNP originally reported at this locus and also the SNP most significantly associated with prostate cancer at this locus, in our present GWAS.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Based on the conditional analysis no other variant on 17q12 remained significant at our GWAS P-value threshold
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	At the 8q24 locus, nine independent prostate cancer risk variants have been previously published (Supplementary Table 1a).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	These variants are distributed over five neighboring LD-regions/blocks (see Fig.1).
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	rs11995378	INTRO	When performing the multivariate logistic regression analysis for the variants at 8q24 in our current GWAS, we first adjusted for the SNP most significantly associated with prostate cancer, which is rs11995378 located in region-1 (r2 = 0.95 between rs11995378 and rs1447295 which is the SNP originally reported in region-1).
0	NA	NA	rs77541621	INTRO	In the second step we conditioned on two SNPs, including the SNP used in step-1 as well as the SNP most significant after step-1, which is rs77541621 located in region-2 (r2 = 0.64 between rs77541621 and rs16901979, which is the SNP initially reported in region-2).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Based on the results from step-2, four SNPs and one INDEL, all correlated with each other (r2 >= 0.74; Supplementary Table 1b), remained significant at the GWAS P-value threshold.
1	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	rs183373024	INTRO	Of those, based on the unconditional family based imputed results, the most significant association with prostate cancer was observed for the minor allele (allele G) of rs183373024 (P = 1.50x10-23, OR = 2.69) and the minor allele (allele A) of rs188140481 (P = 1.5x10-22, OR = 2.88).
0	NA	NA	rs183373024	INTRO	In the third step of the logistic regression, after adding rs183373024 to the list of SNPs conditioned on, no variant remained significant at the applicable P-value threshold of P < 1.5x10-9 (Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	1).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Hence, no further step-wise conditional analysis was done
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	rs13252298	INTRO	Of the previously published prostate cancer risk SNPs located on 8q24 that are not included or not strongly correlated with the SNPs conditioned on in the logistic regression analysis described above, four SNPs remain marginally significant (P < 0.05): rs13252298, rs16902094, rs445114, rs6983267 (Supplementary Table 2)
1	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	rs183373024	INTRO	For validating the Icelandic association results we genotyped rs183373024 and rs188140481 in five prostate cancer study groups of European descent.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	These groups come from The Netherlands, Spain, Romania, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US).
1	NA	NA	rs183373024	INTRO	The combined results of the five study groups were significant for both SNPs and combining them with the imputed results from Iceland gave an estimated OR of 2.59 for rs183373024[G] (Pcomb = 4.1x10-33) and an OR of 2.90 for rs188140481[A] (Pcomb = 6.2x10-34).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The control frequency of the risk alleles of these two variants ranges from 0.1% to 1.1%, being lowest in southern Europe and higher in northern Europe.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	A test of heterogeneity among all six study groups showed no significant difference between the ORs of the two variants (Phet > 0.32; Table 1 and Supplementary Table 3).
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	We also genotyped both SNPs in 498 Asian prostate cancer patients from Hong Kong and 467 African American controls from Chicago but the SNPs were not polymorphic in these study groups.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Hence, if the underlying causative risk variant is present in these two ethnic groups it is either not tagged by these SNPs or very rare
1	NA	NA	rs188140481	INTRO	Since, the association effect of the two variants cannot be distinguished from each other, we elected to focus on rs188140481[A] in subsequent investigations, based on its slightly stronger combined replication results than in the case of rs183373024.
1	NA	NA	rs188140481	INTRO	Neither rs188140481 nor any of the highly correlated (r2 > 0.7; Supplementary Table 1b) variants are present in the latest HapMap release (data release 28).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Therefore, association analysis based on HapMap data did not yield the association signal reported here.
1	NA	NA	rs188140481	INTRO	The SNP rs188140481 is however, in the 1000-genome data set registered into the dbSNP-135 database in July 2011
1	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	rs188140481	INTRO	The SNP, rs188140481, is located telomeric to the previously published region-2 on 8q24; originally reported to contain the prostate cancer risk SNP rs16901979 and later also rs1016343 and rs13252298 (Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	1).
1	NA	NA	rs188140481	INTRO	rs188140481 has D' = 1 with those three SNPs but it is only very weakly correlated with them (r2 <= 0.005).
1	NA	NA	rs188140481	INTRO	Furthermore, the correlation (the r-coefficient) between rs188140481 and rs16901979 is in a negative direction.
1	NA	NA	rs16901979	INTRO	Of the previously published risk SNPs in populations of European descent and located on 8q24, rs16901979 has the closest resemblance in terms of conferred risk and allele frequency (risk allele control frequency in Iceland is ~3% and ~1% for rs16901979[A] and rs188140481[A], respectively).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	This indicates that the two risk variants, are never together on the same haplotype.
1	NA	NA	rs16901979	INTRO	Consequently, the association results for rs16901979 and rs188140481 remain significant after being adjusted for each other.
1	Leukemia	NA	rs188140481	INTRO	Furthermore, rs188140481 is only very weakly correlated (r2 < 0.06) with the previously published leukemia, prostate, colon, breast, or bladder cancer risk variants on 8q24 (Supplementary Table 1a), and the association results for rs188140481 remain significant after being adjusted for all nine previously published prostate cancer risk SNPs at 8q24 (Table 2)
1	NA	NA	rs188140481	INTRO	We examined rs188140481 and the four correlated (r2 > 0.7) variations for known functional features from The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project.
0	allergy	NA	rs183373024	INTRO	We noted that rs183373024 is located at a site of DNaseI hypersensitivity in prostate adenocarcinoma and normal prostate cell lines (LNCaP and PrEC; Supplementary Fig.1).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Whether that has any biological significance remains to be studied further.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Other correlated variants were not found at sites predicted to have a biological effect
1	Breast and prostate cancer	HOXB13	rs138213197	INTRO	Recently, the rare missense mutation G84E (rs138213197[T]) in HOXB13 was found to confer risk of prostate cancer in a US study population.
1	NA	HOXB13	rs138213197	INTRO	In order to assess the HOXB13 association signal in study populations independent of the original report, we genotyped rs138213197 in five study groups of European descent.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Combination of the imputed Icelandic results and the results from the five directly genotyped replication study groups gave an estimated OR of 7.06 (Pcomb.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	= 1.5x10-19; Table 3).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	This effect is comparable but somewhat lower than the effect reported in the initial study.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	rs138213197	INTRO	We also genotyped rs138213197 in 498 Asian prostate cancer patients from Hong Kong and 467 African American controls from Chicago but we did not detect the risk allele in these individuals, suggesting that either is the risk variant very rare or not present in these two ethnic groups
1	aggressive disease	HOXB13	NA	INTRO	In order to analyze further the new variant on 8q24 and the HOXB13 mutation we stratified the patients from the six European study groups according to age at diagnosis and aggressiveness of the disease.
0	aggressive disease	NA	NA	INTRO	For rs188140481[A] at 8q24, when comparing the group of patients with a more aggressive phenotype (Gleason >=7 and/or T3 or higher and/or node positive and/or metastatic disease) to the group with less aggressive tumors (Gleason <7 and T2 or lower), a non-significant trend towards being diagnosed with an advanced disease was observed (OR = 1.30, Pcomb.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	= 0.08; Supplementary Table 4a).
1	NA	HOXB13	NA	INTRO	The same type of analysis for the HOXB13 mutation resulted in an OR = 1.05 for the more aggressive phenotype (Pcomb.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	= 0.90; Supplementary Table 4b).
1	NA	HOXB13	NA	INTRO	When stratifying according to age at diagnosis, carriers of allele A of rs188140481on 8q24 were found to be diagnosed 1.26 years younger than non-carriers (Pcomb = 0.0059, Supplementary Table 5a), and carriers of the HOXB13 mutation (rs138213197[T]) were found to be diagnosed 1.16 years younger than non-carriers (Pcomb =0.098; Supplementary Table 5b)
1	Breast and prostate cancer	HOXB13	NA	INTRO	When examining the genotypic status of all subjects in our study, one subject was found to be homozygous for the HOXB13 mutation; a Dutch prostate cancer patient diagnosed at the age of 69 and with a positive family history of prostate cancer (two brothers diagnosed at the age of 67 and 74, but no DNA samples were available).
1	Breast and prostate cancer	HOXB13	NA	INTRO	In the Icelandic study group, we identified 13 Icelandic male carriers of the HOXB13 mutation who have been diagnosed with prostate cancer.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Thereof, four patients have a positive family history of prostate cancer, two belong to a brother pair, and two belong to a father-offspring pair.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	The remaining nine patients do not have any 1st or 2nd degree male relatives diagnosed with prostate cancer, based on deCODE's extensive genealogy database and the nationwide ICR database
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	We identified 16 homozygous carriers of the 8q24 variant: a Dutch prostate cancer patient diagnosed at the age of 69 and not known to have a positive family history of prostate cancer; 8 Icelandic females and 7 Icelandic males.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Of the 7 Icelandic males 5 have been diagnosed with prostate cancer (age at diagnosis ranges between 55 and 87 years) and the remaining two are both born in 1953 (current age is 59 years) and not known to have been diagnosed with prostate cancer.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	The 5 Icelandic homozygous prostate cancer patients (of whom four belong to two brother pairs) all have one or more close relatives within the nuclear family diagnosed with prostate cancer (Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	2).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	This demonstrates a high prevalence of the disease among homozygous male carriers over 60 years of age.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Furthermore, using directly generated genotypes only, the carrier frequency among Icelandic patients with a positive family history was estimated to be 10.9% compared to 4.2% among patients without a family history (OR = 2.70, P = 1.8x10-5)
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	In summary, we have discovered a new independent prostate cancer risk variant at the 8q24 locus.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The risk profile of this new variant differs from other GWAS-based discovered risk variants in being rare and conferring greater risk of the disease.
