0	insulin-treated diabetes	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Despite the fact that there is clearly a large genetic component to type 1 diabetes (T1D), uncovering the genes contributing to this disease has proven challenging.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	However, in the past three years there has been relatively major progress in this regard, with advances in genetic screening technologies allowing investigators to scan the genome for variants conferring risk for disease without prior hypotheses.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Such genome-wide association studies have revealed multiple regions of the genome to be robustly and consistently associated with T1D.

0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	Diabetes impacts approximately 200 million people worldwide, with microvascular and cardiovascular disease being the primary complications.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	Approximately 10% of cases are type 1 diabetes (T1D) sufferers, with ~3% increase in the incidence of T1D globally per year.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	It is expected that the incidence is 40% higher in 2010 than in 1998
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	T1D is a clear example of a complex trait that results from the interplay between environmental and genetic factors.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	There are many lines of evidence that there is a strong genetic component to T1D, primarily due to the fact that T1D has high concordance among monozygotic twins and runs strongly in families, together with a high sibling risk
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Prior to the era of GWAS, only five loci had been fully established to be associated with T1D.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	However, the majority of the other reported associations in the pre-GWAS era remain highly doubtful, where an initial report of association does not hold up in subsequent replication attempts by other investigative groups.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	This previous hazy picture of the genetics of T1D can be put down to the use of the only methodologies that were available at the time and which were much more limited than GWAS i.e.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	the candidate gene approach (where genomic regions were studied based on biological reasoning) and family-based linkage methodologies.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Inconsistent findings can also be attributed to small sample sizes i.e.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	when power is low the false discovery rate tends to be high; GWAS per se has not improved consistency, rather it has leveraged large, well powered sample sizes combined with sound statistical analyses
0	NA	HLA	NA	INTRO	It has been long established that approximately half of the genetic risk for T1D is conferred by the genomic region harboring the HLA class II genes (primarily HLA-DRB1, -DQA1 and -DQB1 genes), which encode the highly polymorphic antigen-presenting proteins.
0	NA	insulin	NA	INTRO	Other established loci prior to the application of GWAS are the genes encoding insulin (INS), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4), protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 22 (PTPN22) gene, interleukin 2 receptor alpha (IL2RA) and ubiquitin-associated and SH3 domain-containing protein A (UBASH3A)
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The application of genome wide association studies (GWAS) has robustly revealed dozens of genetic contributors to T1D, the results of which have largely been independently replicated.
0	cross-disease	NA	NA	INTRO	The most recently reported meta-analysis of this trait identified in excess of forty loci, including 18 novel regions plus confirmation of a number of loci uncovered through cross-disease comparisons.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	As such, the risks conferred by these additional loci are relatively modest compared to the 'low-hanging fruit' described in the first studies and could only be ultimately uncovered when larger sample sizes were utilized
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We sought to expand further on this mode of analysis by combining our cohort with all publically released genome wide SNP datasets to identify additional loci contributing to the etiology of T1D.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Unfortunately, there is a relative paucity of control genotype data in these publically available sources.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	To circumvent this problem, we combined individual level data from each available cohort and we then compared the cases with controls from two sources.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We next separated all the individual level data into two groups, characterized by the type of genotyping platform that was used to genotype the samples, which would later be recombined using inverse-variance meta-analysis.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	The 6,523 cases genotyped on an Illumina BeadChip included subjects from McGill University, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial - Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (DCCT-EDIC) cohort, and the Type 1 Diabetes Genetics Consortium (T1DGC), which in turn were compared with 6,648 similarly genotyped controls recruited at CHOP.
0	Kidneys in Diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	The 3,411 cases genotyped on Affymetrix arrays included subjects from the Genetics of Kidneys in Diabetes Study (GoKinD) and the Wellcome Trust Cases Control Consortium (WTCCC) that were then compared with 10,308 similarly genotyped controls, including being derived from non-autoimmune disease related cases from the WTCCC, as well as from the British 1958 Birth Cohort and the UK National Blood Service

1	NA	NA	rs539514	RESULTS	Three of the SNPs, namely rs539514, rs478222 and rs924043, had combined P-values <5x10-8, the statistical threshold for genome wide significance, while the remaining three, namely rs550448, rs12679857 and rs6547853, failed to reach this bar but were suggestive of association as the alleles yielded both a consistent direction of effect and P-values <0.05 in the replication cohort.

1	NA	LMO7	rs539514	DISCUSS	The most significantly associated SNP (rs539514, P = 5.66x10-11) resides in an intronic region of the LMO7 (LIM domain only 7) gene on 13q22.

0	pancreatic	LMO7	NA	DISCUSS	Although the function of LMO7 doesn't clearly relate to the etiology of T1D, LMO7 is expressed in pancreatic islets and thus is a possible biological candidate at this locus; however it should be noted that the retinal, muscular development and islet patterns are a key element in Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy, caused by mutations in LMO7 , but bears very little similarity to T1D
1	NA	EFR3B	rs478222	DISCUSS	The second most significantly associated SNP (rs478222, P = 3.50x10-9) resides in an intronic region of the EFR3B (protein EFR3 homolog B) gene on 2p23; however the region of linkage disequilibrium is approximately 800 kb and harbors additional multiple genes, including 3NCOA1, C2orf79, CENPO, ADCY3, DNAJC27, POMC, and DNMT3A.

0	NA	NA	rs2165738	DISCUSS	A previous meta-analysis of a subset of the data used in this current study found suggestive association with T1D in the same LD block with the independent SNP, rs2165738(r2 = 0.115), but did not achieve genome wide significance at that time (P = 3.65x10-6); however, we only found modest evidence of association with rs2165738 (P = 4.78x10-3) in our discovery cohort.
0	inflammatory bowel disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	There has also been association to inflammatory bowel disease height and BMI reported at this locus, where in both cases the risk allele for increased height or BMI was protective for T1D risk
1	NA	WDR27	rs924043	DISCUSS	The third most significantly associated SNP (rs924043, P = 8.06x10-9) lies in an intergenic region on 6q27, where the region of association is approximately 900 kb and harbors multiple genes including WDR27, C6orf120, PHF10, TCTE3, C6orf208, LOC154449, DLL1, FAM120B, PSMB1, TBP and PCD2 (Figure S5).
1	NA	TNFRSF11B	NA	DISCUSS	In addition, despite not reaching the bar for genome wide significance, we did observe evidence for association at three additional loci (Table 1) containing the candidate genes LOC100128081, TNFRSF11B and FOSL2.
1	NA	TNFRSF11B	NA	DISCUSS	Of these, it is notable that TNFRSF11B is a strongly associated locus with bone mineral density, also as a consequence of GWAS.

0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We did not have the same control data to be able to make the same comparisons.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In the case of the Affymetrix analysis, some American cases were analyzed with purely British controls and, in the case of the Illumina analysis, some British cases with purely American controls.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	As such, we were forced to make our corrections using eigenvectors as covariates in our analysis; this will have the effect of modestly weakening the level of significance for associations that vary in allele frequency between the cases and controls, as now the case and controls will both vary with the eigenvectors to some degree.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This in effect will make our analysis overly conservative with estimating the true effect of a SNP, and in fact every SNP that had a P-value less than 0.05 in the replication set did indeed have a greater effect than that which was estimated from the discovery set
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In summary, we provide convincing evidence for the existence of three additional loci associated with the T1D, adding to the repertoire of over 50 loci already demonstrated to be associated with the disease
