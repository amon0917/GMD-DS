0	breast cancer	NA	NA	METHODS	Meta-Analysis Gene-set Enrichment of variaNT Associations (MAGENTA, ver2.4) software was used to assess potential pathways that are associated with breast cancer by using GWAS and 1000 G imputed dataset (RSQ > 0.9).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	In brief, gene boundary between 110 kb upstream of the gene's most extreme transcript start site and 40 kb downstream to the gene's most extreme transcript end site was set.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	This boundary was suggested by a comprehensive study of putative functional regulatory element (cis-eQTLs) using expression data from human lymphoblastoid cell line.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	After assigning SNPs within the gene boundary, cumulative P-value of the SNPs within individual genes were calculated after correcting for confounders such as gene size, variant number and LD properties using step-wise multiple linear regression analysis.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Gene-set enrichment analysis P-value was calculated by referring to a total of 3,217 gene-sets from Gene ontology, KEGG, PANTHER, Biocarta and Reactome databases.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	METHODS	False discovery rate (FDR < 0.05) was used to evaluate the significance of associations of the pathway with breast cancer
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	To assess expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), correlation between SNP genotypes and expression of the nearby genes in a genomic locus was evaluated from the GTEx portal V8 (http://www.gtexportal.org/home/) focusing specifically on breast-mammary tissue.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The eQTL analysis was expanded to include all 12 genome-wide level linked variants (LD > = 0.8 ASN 1 K genomes) due to potential differences in the database SNP repository
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	METHODS	wGRS analysis was carried out to evaluate the cumulative effects of genetic variants associated with breast cancer risk.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	A total of 12 SNPs that are with P < 5.0 x 10-8 from the whole-genome meta-analysis of Phase I + II and Phase III GWAS were utilized to establish the model.
1	NA	NA	rs2540431	METHODS	These SNPs include rs2540431 on chromosome 2q33.1, rs9862599 on 3q13.11, rs1838337 on 3q25.1, rs7701466 on 5p12, rs79160707 on 5q11.2, rs6900157 on 6q25.1, rs2912778 on 10q26.13, rs805583 on 12p11.22, rs10744856 on 12q24.21, rs3803662 and rs4784227 on 16q12.1, rs75286142 on 21q22.12.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The estimate (weight) of each associated SNP was evaluated by multivariate logistic regression analysis after incorporating 12 SNPs into the model.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The cumulative risk scores were calculated by multiplying the weight (estimate) of the SNPs with the number of risk alleles (0/1/2) of the SNPs carried by each of the individual, subsequently the sum of the scores were taken across the number of SNPs in the model.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The risk scores were then classified into four different categories that derived from mean and standard deviation (SD); group 1, < mean-1SD; group 2, mean-1SD to mean; group 3 mean to mean + 1 SD; group 4, mean + 1 SD to mean + 2 SD and group 5 > mean + 2 SD.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Odds ratio and 95% confidence interval was evaluated by using group 1 as reference.
0	cancers	NA	NA	METHODS	Validation of this model was carried out by genotyping the 12 SNPs using the sample groups from Aichi Cancer Centre.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Similar categorization was performed to evaluate the validity of this model.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	METHODS	Lastly, receiving operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted to observe how well this model could be used as prediction model for breast cancer
