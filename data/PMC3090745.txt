0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	The Alzheimer Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC) performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) using a 3 stage design consisting of a discovery stage (Stage 1) and two replication stages (Stages 2 and 3).
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Both joint and meta-analysis analysis approaches were used.
0	NA	NA	rs4938933	ABSTRACT	We obtained genome-wide significant results at MS4A4A [rs4938933; Stages 1+2, meta-analysis (PM) = 1.7 x 10-9, joint analysis (PJ) = 1.7 x 10-9; Stages 1-3, PM = 8.2 x 10-12], CD2AP (rs9349407; Stages 1-3, PM = 8.6 x 10-9), EPHA1 (rs11767557; Stages 1-3 PM = 6.0 x 10-10), and CD33 (rs3865444; Stages 1-3, PM = 1.6 x 10-9).
0	NA	NA	rs6701713	ABSTRACT	We confirmed that CR1 (rs6701713; PM = 4.6x10-10, PJ = 5.2x10-11), CLU (rs1532278; PM = 8.3 x 10-8, PJ = 1.9x10-8), BIN1 (rs7561528; PM = 4.0x10-14; PJ = 5.2x10-14), and PICALM (rs561655; PM = 7.0 x 10-11, PJ = 1.0x10-10) but not EXOC3L2 are LOAD risk loci
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Alzheimer Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting more than 13% of individuals aged 65 years and older and 30%-50% aged 80 years and older.
0	Alzheimer's disease	apolipoprotein E	NA	INTRO	Early work identified mutations in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 that cause early-onset autosomal dominant AD and variants in APOE that affect LOAD susceptibility.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	A recent GWAS identified CR1, CLU, PICALM, and BIN1 as LOAD susceptibility loci.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	However, because LOAD heritability estimates are high (h2   60-80%), much of the genetic contribution remains unknown
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	To identify genetic variants associated with risk for AD, the ADGC assembled a discovery dataset [Stage 1; 8,309 LOAD cases, 7,366 cognitively normal controls (CNEs)] using data from eight cohorts and a ninth newly assembled cohort from the 29 NIA-funded Alzheimer Disease Centers (ADCs) (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2, Supplementary Note) with data coordinated by the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center (NACC) and samples coordinated by the National Cell Repository for Alzheimer Disease (NCRAD).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	For the Stage 2 replication, we used four additional datasets and additional samples from the ADCs (3,531 LOAD cases, 3,565 CNEs).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The Stage 3 replication used the results of association analyses provided by three other consortia (Hollingworth et al.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	; 7,650 LOAD cases, 25,839 mixed-age controls).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	For Stages 1 and 2, we used both a meta-analysis (M) approach that integrates results from association analyses of individual datasets; and a joint analysis (J) approach where genotype data from each study are pooled.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The latter method has improved power over meta-analysis in the absence of between-study heterogeneity and more direct correction for confounding sampling bias.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We were limited to meta-analysis for Stage 3
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Because cohorts were genotyped using different platforms, we used imputation to generate a common set of 2,324,889 SNPs.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We applied uniform stringent quality control measures to all datasets to remove low-quality and redundant samples and problematic SNPs (Supplementary Tables 3, 4, and Online Methods).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We performed association analysis assuming an additive model on the log odds ratio scale with adjustment for population substructure using logistic regression for case-control data and generalized estimating equations (GEE) with a logistic model for family data.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Results from individual datasets were combined in the meta-analysis using the inverse variance method, applying a genomic control to each dataset.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The joint analysis was performed using GEE and incorporated terms to adjust for population substructure and site-specific effects (Online Methods).
0	death	apolipoprotein E	NA	INTRO	For both approaches, we also examined an extended model of covariate adjustment that adjusted for age (age at onset or death in cases; age at exam or death in controls), sex, and number of APOE epsilon4 alleles (0, 1, or 2).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Genomic inflation factors (lambda) for both the discovery meta-analysis and the joint analysis and extended models were less than 1.05, indicating that there was not substantial inflation of the test statistics (Supplementary Table 3, Supplementary Figure 1).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Association findings from meta-analysis and joint analysis were comparable
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	rs4420638	INTRO	In Stage 1, the strongest signal was from the APOE region (e.g., rs4420638, PM =1.1 x 10-266, PJ =1.3 x 10-253; Supplementary Table 5).
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	INTRO	Excluding the APOE region, SNPs at nine distinct loci yielded a PM or PJ <= 10-6 (Table 1; all SNPs with P < 10-4 are in Supplementary Table 5).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	SNPs from these nine loci were carried forward to Stage 2.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Five of these had not previously been associated with LOAD at a genome-wide significance level of P <= 5.0 x 10-8 (MS4A, EPHA1, CD33, ARID5B, and CD2AP).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Because Hollingworth et al.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	identified SNPs at ABCA7 as a novel LOAD locus, we included ABCA7 region SNPs in Stage 2 and provided the results to Hollingworth et al.. For all loci in Table 1, we did not detect evidence for effect heterogeneity (Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	2).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	One novel locus (MS4A) was significant in the Stage 1+2 analysis.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Four other loci approached but did not reach genome-wide significance in the Stage 1+2 analyses and were carried forward to Stage 3.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	For three of these (CD33, EPHA1, and CD2AP), Stage 3 analysis strengthened evidence for association.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	However, Stages 2 and 3 results did not support Stage 1 results for ARID5B 2 (Table 2)
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Stage 1+2 analysis identified the MS4A gene cluster as a novel LOAD locus (PM = 1.7 x 10-9, PJ = 1.7 x 10-9)(Table 1, Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	1A).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The minor allele (MAF = 0.39) was protective with identical odds ratios (ORs) from both meta-analysis and joint analysis (ORM and ORJ = 0.88, 95% CI: 0.85-0.92).
0	NA	NA	rs4938933	INTRO	In the Stage 1+2 analysis, other SNPs gave smaller P values when compared to discovery SNP rs4938933, with the most significant SNP being rs4939338 (PM = 2.6 x 10-11, PJ = 4.6 x 10-11; ORM and ORJ = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.84-0.91) (Supplementary Table 5).
0	NA	NA	rs670139	INTRO	In the accompanying manuscript, genome-wide significant results were also obtained at the MS4A locus (rs670139, PM = 5.0 x 10-12) using an independent sample.
0	NA	NA	rs4938933	INTRO	In a combined analysis of ADGC results and those from Hollingworth et al., the evidence for this locus at rs4938933 increased to PM = 8.2 x 10-12 (Table 3: ORM = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.87-0.92; Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	1A)
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	SNPs in the CD2AP locus also met our Stage 1 criteria for additional analysis (Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	1B).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Stage 2 data modestly strengthened this association, but the results did not reach genome-wide significance.
0	NA	NA	rs9349407	INTRO	Stage 3 analysis yielded a genome-wide significance result for rs9349407 (PM = 8.6 x 10-9), identifying CD2AP as a novel LOAD locus.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The minor allele (MAF = 0.27) at this SNP increased risk for LOAD (ORM = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.07-1.15) (Table 2, Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	1B)
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Another locus studied further in Stages 2 and 3 centered on EPHA1.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Previous work provided suggestive evidence that this is a LOAD risk locus, although the associations did not reach genome-wide significance (P = 1.7 x 10-6).
0	NA	NA	rs11767557	INTRO	Here, results from Stages 1 and 2 for SNP rs11767557, located in the promoter region of EPHA1, reached genome-wide significance in the joint analysis.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The addition of Stage 3 results increased evidence for association (PM = 6.0 x 10-10, Table 2, Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	1C).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The minor allele (MAF = 0.19) for this SNP is protective (ORM = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.86-0.93).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We observed no evidence for heterogeneity at this locus (Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	2D, heterogeneity P = 0.58)
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	INTRO	In Stages 1 and 2, strong evidence for association was also obtained for SNPs in CD33, a gene located approximately 6Mb from APOE, but the results did not reach genome-wide significance.
0	NA	NA	rs3865444	INTRO	The addition of Stage 3 data confirmed that CD33 is a LOAD risk locus (rs3865444; Stages 1-3, PM = 1.6 x 10-9).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The minor allele (MAF = 0.30) is protective (ORM = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.88-0.93; Tables 1,2, Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	1D).
0	NA	NA	rs3826656	INTRO	A single SNP (rs3826656) in the 5' region of CD33, was previously reported as an AD-related locus using a family-based approach as genome-wide significant (P = 6.6 x 10-6) .
0	NA	NA	rs3826656	INTRO	We were unable to replicate this finding (PM = 0.73; PJ = 0.39, Stage 1 analysis for rs3826656).
0	NA	NA	rs3826656	INTRO	Though rs3826656 is only 1,348 bp from our top SNP (rs3865444), these 2 sites display only weak LD (r2 = 0.13)
0	NA	NA	rs3764650	INTRO	Hollingworth et al  report highly significant evidence for the association of an ABCA7 SNP rs3764650 with LOAD (PM = 4.5 x 10-17) that included data from our study.
0	NA	NA	rs3752246	INTRO	In our Stage 1+2 analysis, we obtained suggestive evidence for association with ABCA7 SNP rs3752246 (PM = 5.8 x 10-7, and PJ = 5.0 x 10-7), which is a missense variant (G1527A) that may alter the function of the ABCA7 protein (see Supplementary Table 6 for functional SNPs in LD with SNPs yielding PM or PJ < 10-4)
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Our Stage 1+2 analyses also confirmed the association of previously reported loci (BIN1, CR1, CLU, and PICALM) with LOAD (Table 1).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	For each locus, supporting evidence was P <= 5.0 x 10-8 in one or both types of analysis
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We also examined SNPs with statistically significant GWAS results reported by others (GAB2, PCDH11X, GOLM1, and MTHFD1L , Supplementary Table 7).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Stage 1 data were used except for PCDH11X where Stage 1+2 data were used because Affymetrix platforms do not contain the appropriate SNP.
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	INTRO	Only SNPs in the APOE, CR1, PICALM, and BIN1 loci demonstrated P < 10-6.
0	NA	NA	rs11754661	INTRO	For MTHFD1L, at rs11754661 (previously reported P = 4.7 x 10-8) we obtained modest independent association evidence (ORM = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.04-1.29, PM = 0.006; ORJ = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.08-1.32, PJ = 7.5 x 10-4).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	For the remaining sites, only nominal evidence (P < 0.05) or no evidence was obtained.
0	NA	NA	rs10793294	INTRO	For the GAB2 locus at rs10793294 (previously reported P = 1.60 x 10-7), we obtained nominal statistical significance results (PM = 0.017; PJ = 0.029).
0	NA	NA	rs5984894	INTRO	The association for rs5984894 in the PCDH11X locus (previously reported P = 3.9 x 10-12), did not replicate (PM = 0.89, PJ = 0.26).
0	NA	NA	rs10868366	INTRO	Likewise, findings at GOLM1 for rs10868366 (previously reported P = 2.40 x 10-4) did not replicate (PM = 0.71; PJ = 0.62).
0	NA	NA	rs3781835	INTRO	Another gene consistently implicated in LOAD is SORL1 where at rs3781835 (previously reported P = 0.006), we obtained modest evidence for association (ORM = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.60-0.86, PM = 2.9 x 10-4; ORJ = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.59-0.86; PJ = 3.8 x 10-4)
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	INTRO	We examined the influence of the APOE epsilon4 allele on the loci in Table 1, stratified by and in interactions with APOE epsilon4 allele carrier status.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	After adjustment, all loci had similar effect sizes to the unadjusted analyses with some showing a modest reduction in statistical significance.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We previously reported evidence for a PICALM-APOE interaction using a dataset that largely overlaps with the Stage 1 dataset used here.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	However, using the Stage 1+2 data, we do not replicate this finding or see evidence of SNP-APOE interactions with Table 1 loci (data not shown)
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	rs597668	INTRO	Previous work reported an association between LOAD and chromosome 19 SNP rs597668, located 7.2 kb proximal to EXOC3L2 and 296 kb distal of APOE .
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	INTRO	While we did observe a signal for this SNP (Stage 1, PM = 1.5 x 10-9; PJ = 7.7 x 10-10) and other SNPs in the EXOC2L3-MARK4 region, evidence was completely extinguished for all SNPs after adjustment for APOE (Online Methods, Supplementary Table 8), suggesting that signal in this region is from APOE
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Our observation of genome-wide significant associations at MS4A4A, CD2AP, EPHA1, and CD33 extend our understanding of the genetic architecture of LOAD and confirm the emerging consensus that common genetic variation plays a significant role in the etiology of LOAD.
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	INTRO	With our findings and those by Hollingsworth et al., there are now ten LOAD susceptibility loci (APOE, CR1, CLU, PICALM, BIN1, EPHA1, MS4A, CD33, CD2AP, and ABCA7).
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	INTRO	Examining the amount of genetic effect attributable to these candidate genes, the most strongly associated SNPs at each locus other than APOE demonstrated population attributable fractions (PAFs) between 2.72-5.97% (Supplemental Table 9), with a cumulative PAF for non-APOE loci estimated to be as much as 35%; however, these estimates may vary widely between studies, and the actual effect sizes are likely to be much smaller than those estimated here because of the 'winner's curse'.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Also the results do not account for interaction among loci, and are not derived from appropriate population-based samples
0	insufficient	NA	NA	INTRO	A recent review of GWAS studies noted that risk alleles with small effect sizes (0.80 < OR < 1.2) likely exist for complex diseases such as LOAD but remain undetected, even with thousands of samples, because of insufficient power.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Our discovery dataset (Stage 1; 8,309 cases and 7,366 controls), was well-powered to detect associations exceeding the statistical significance threshold of P < 10-6 (Supplementary Table 9).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	If there are many loci of more modest effects, some, but not all, will likely be detected in any one study.
0	NA	NA	rs3752246	INTRO	This likely explains the genome-wide statistical significance for the ABCA7 locus in the accompanying manuscript, which reaches only modest statistical significance in our dataset (rs3752246; PM = 1.0 x 10-5, PJ = 1.9 x 10-5).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Finding additional LOAD loci will require larger studies with increased depth of genotyping to test for the effects of both common and rare variants
