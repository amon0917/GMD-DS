0	breast cancer	BRCA2	NA	INTRO	We hypothesized that an agnostic search for breast cancer loci in an enriched population of BRCA2 mutation carriers, the first among this high risk population, would provide greater power than a sporadic population of equal number, and would yield associations specific to BRCA2 carriers and/or the general population

0	breast cancer	BRCA2	NA	DISCUSS	In this GWAS of BRCA2 mutation carriers, the first in this high risk population, we found previously identified breast cancer susceptibility loci modified risk of BRCA2-associated breast cancer with similar magnitude of association.
1	breast cancer	FGFR2	rs2981575	DISCUSS	Although FGFR2 (rs2981575) was the only locus to reach genome-wide statistical significance, novel loci, rs16917302 and rs10509168 were each associated with breast cancer risk
0	NA	ZNF365	rs16917302	DISCUSS	rs16917302 is located on chromosome 10, in the zinc finger protein 365 gene (ZNF365).
0	breast cancer	ZNF365	rs10509168	DISCUSS	A recent multistage GWAS of 15,992 sporadic breast cancer cases and 16,891 controls also observed an inverse association (per allele OR = 0.82, 95% CI 0.82-0.91, ) between breast cancer risk and rs10509168, a SNP 18kb from rs16917302 (pairwise ) and located in intron 4 of ZNF365  .
0	breast cancer	BRCA2	rs16917302	DISCUSS	Of the 3,659 cases and 4,897 controls in phase 1 of that study, imputation revealed that the locus identified in our BRCA2 study, rs16917302, was significantly associated with risk for breast cancer (p = 0.02) (Easton DF, personal communication).
0	NA	GMEB2	rs311499	DISCUSS	The second novel SNP in the current study, rs311499, is located on chromosome 20, within a region containing several possible candidate genes including GMEB2, SRMS, PTK6, STMN3, and TNFRSF6.
0	prostate carcinogenesis	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The functional significance of both of these regions with breast carcinogenesis is unknown; further research is warranted
0	NA	NA	rs311499	DISCUSS	There was some evidence that the HR associated with rs311499 may change with age.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We also observed that the stage 1 HR for this SNPs was larger in magnitude compared to the stage 2 HR, consistent with a winner's curse effect.
0	NA	BRCA2	NA	DISCUSS	"Since stage 1 of our experiment included mostly BRCA2 mutation carriers diagnosed at a young age, and stage 2 mutation carriers diagnosed an older age, the ""winner's curse"" and age-specific effects are confounded and may be difficult to distinguish."
0	NA	NA	rs311499	DISCUSS	Fitting the age-dependent HR model for SNP rs311499 using the stage 2 data yielded no significant variation in the HR by age (p = 0.47), but the sample size for this analysis was relatively small.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Future larger studies should aim to clarify this
0	breast cancer	BRCA1	NA	DISCUSS	Mutations in known genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53, CHEK2, PTEN, and ATM) explain only 20-25% of the familial clustering of breast cancer; the residual familial clustering may be explained by the existence of multiple common, low-penetrance alleles ('polygenes').
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Perhaps because the majority of BRCA2-associated breast tumors are estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, as are the majority of non-hereditary breast cancers, risk alleles for sporadic breast cancer are more likely to be modifiers of risk of BRCA2-associated hereditary breast cancer.
1	NA	BRCA2	rs2981575	DISCUSS	Of the seven GWAS-identified breast cancer-associated SNPs examined in a BRCA2 background, SNPS in FGFR2 (rs2981575), TOX3 (rs3803662), MAP3K1 (rs889312), and LSP1 (rs3817198) have been shown to modify BRCA2 penetrance, in contrast with BRCA1 tumors, in which only two of these same SNPs (based on a 2 degrees of freedom model) modified risk of these largely ER-negative tumors.
0	breast cancer	BRCA2	NA	DISCUSS	As previously noted, the stage 1 HRs among BRCA2 mutation carriers, reported here, were nearly identical to odds ratio estimates observed in sporadic breast cancer studies, consistent with a simple multiplicative interaction between the BRCA2 mutant alleles and the common susceptibility SNPs.
0	breast cancer	BRCA2	NA	DISCUSS	If replicated, the two additional SNPs identified here would only explain about 1.7% of the variance in breast cancer risk among BRCA2 mutation carriers.
0	NA	BRCA2	135 G>C	DISCUSS	Taken together, the combined effects of all the common and putative risk modifiers in this study only account for ~4% of the variance of BRCA2 mutations, compared with 1.1% for the single RAD51 135 G>C variant, which is rare and biologically-linked to BRCA2 function, as shown by candidate gene studies.
0	cancers	BRCA1	NA	DISCUSS	Thus, the common alleles that modify risk in BRCA1 and BRCA2 backgrounds appear to have comparable associated risks in sporadic ER-positive and ER-negative tumors, respectively.
0	NA	BRCA1	NA	DISCUSS	While individual SNPs are unlikely to be used to guide radiographic screening and risk-reducing surgical strategies, the combined effect of these SNPs may ultimately be used for the tailor management of subsets of BRCA mutation carriers
0	insufficient	BRCA2	6174delT	DISCUSS	While we took great efforts to collect all of the possible known BRCA2 mutation carriers, there were insufficient numbers to stratify by race and BRCA2 mutations with the exception of BRCA2*6174delT mutations.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Due to the small numbers of women of non-European ancestry who have participated in the individual studies represented here, the current analysis was based only on women who had genetic backgrounds consistent with HapMap CEU samples.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	While we expect that SNPs identified among women of European ancestry might also be applicable to women of other genetic backgrounds, additional research in these populations will be needed.
0	NA	BRCA2	6174delT	DISCUSS	Similarly, the observed associations represented across all types of mutations, and specifically a weighted average of BRCA2*6174delT and non-delT mutations.
0	NA	BRCA2	NA	DISCUSS	It is possible that the observed associations may only modify the penetrance of specific BRCA2 mutations due to differential effects on function or differences in genetic background.
0	NA	BRCA2	6174delT	DISCUSS	Our analysis was stratified on the basis of the most common BRCA2 mutation, BRCA2*6174delT, which is prevalent in individuals with an Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Large numbers of mutation carriers will be necessary to calculate mutation-specific estimates.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In addition, there was a drop-out of SNPs in the two phases of this study.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	While we were able to achieve a representative coverage of the genome, it is also possible that additional studies using denser arrays may provide further information
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	As expected, we observed associations with some of the major common genetic variants seen in genome-wide scans of breast cancer in a non-BRCA1/2 mutation background.
1	NA	FGFR2	NA	DISCUSS	However, we found no evidence for loci with stronger effects than FGFR2.
0	breast cancer	ZNF365	NA	DISCUSS	Although we observed an association with a novel locus at ZNF365 that appears also to be a risk factor for sporadic breast cancer, overall, our results suggest that there are no common variants with major effects (i.e., OR>2.0) that are specific in BRCA2 carriers.
1	breast cancer	BRCA1	rs9393597	DISCUSS	Similarly, in a recent report of SNPs from sporadic breast cancer GWAS genotyped in a restricted set of BRCA1/2 carriers, loci in LOC134997 (rs9393597: per allele HR = 1.55, 95% CI 1.25-1.92, ) and FBXL7 (rs12652447: HR = 1.37, 95% CI 1.16-1.62, ) were associated with BRCA2 breast cancer risk with p-values weaker than FGFR2 reported here (per allele ), although the magnitudes of the associations were slightly stronger than FGFR2 (HR = 1.28).
0	breast cancer	BRCA2	rs9393597	DISCUSS	Although these SNPs were not in our genotyped panel of SNPs at stage 1, imputation results indicate that SNP rs9393597 has a p-value of 0.008 and SNP rs12652447 a p-value of 0.04 for association with breast cancer risk for the BRCA2 mutation carriers in our stage1.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, there is substantial overlap between our study and the study of Wang et al.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Replication in larger datasets will be necessary to precisely estimate the magnitude of the associations of suspected loci identified from our study, candidate gene analysis, and other selection approaches.
0	breast cancer	BRCA2	NA	DISCUSS	It is of interest, however, that when utilizing an agnostic approach in BRCA2 mutation carriers in this study, the major determinants of risk variation in mutation carriers are those that also modify risk in subsets of sporadic, BRCA1/2 wild type, breast cancer.
0	breast cancer	BRCA2	NA	DISCUSS	However, it remains possible that unique variants with smaller effects, or rarer variants (not evaluated in this experiment), may be specific modifiers of breast cancer risk in BRCA2 carriers.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Their detection would require study populations much larger than the current analysis, which is presently the largest such cohort assembled

0	breast cancer	NA	NA	METHODS	In total for stage 2 replication phase, we selected 113 SNPs and 1,524 breast cancer carriers and 1,508 control carriers (Table 2) for genotyping using the Sequenom iPLEX platform
0	IBS	NA	NA	METHODS	Samples were excluded for call rates <=95% (n = 476), duplication in stage 2 (identity by state (IBS)~1.0; n = 43), duplication in stage 1 and 2 (IBS; n = 25), lack of complete phenotype data (n = 1), and insufficient country-specific numbers (n = 1; Figure S6).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	A total of 100 SNPs were successfully multiplexed into three pools; the remaining 13 SNPs were not genotyped.
0	NA	MAF>1%	NA	METHODS	Genotyping QC filters excluded 15 SNPs due to call rates <=90% (n = 14) and MAF<1% (n = 1).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	In summary, the final association analyses in stage 2 were based on 2,486 carriers (1,264 affected and 1,222 unaffected carriers) and 85 SNPs
0	Colon and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer	NA	NA	METHODS	Carriers were censored at the first breast or ovarian cancer or bilateral prophylactic mastectomy, whichever occurred first.
0	cancers	NA	NA	METHODS	Carriers who developed any cancer were censored at time of bilateral prophylactic mastectomy if it occurred more than a year prior to the cancer diagnosis (to avoid censoring at bilateral mastectomies related to diagnosis in which rounded ages were used).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The remaining carriers were censored at the age of last observation.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	This was defined either by the age/date at interview or age at follow-up depending on the information provided by the participating center.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	METHODS	Carriers censored at diagnosis of breast cancer were considered cases in the analysis.
0	Colon and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer	NA	NA	METHODS	Mutation carriers censored at ovarian cancer diagnosis were considered unaffected.
0	cancers	BRCA1	NA	METHODS	Carriers with a censoring/last follow-up age older than age 80 were censored at age 80 because there are no reliable cancer incidence rates for BRCA1/2 carriers beyond age 80
0	NA	BRCA2	NA	METHODS	Analyses, based on 1,703 BRCA2 mutation carriers and 592,163 SNPs, were performed within a survival analysis framework.
0	NA	Cox	NA	METHODS	Since the mutation carriers were not selected at random with respect to their disease status, standard methods of survival (e.g., Cox regression) may lead to biased estimates of relative risk.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Therefore, analyses were conducted by modeling the retrospective likelihood of the observed genotypes conditional on the disease phenotypes.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	METHODS	The associations between genotype and breast cancer risk at both stages were assessed using the 1-degree of freedom score test statistic based on this retrospective likelihood, as previously described.
0	NA	BRCA2	6174delT	METHODS	All models were stratified by country of study and 6174delT (c.5946delT) mutation status, the most common BRCA2 mutation in this study and a marker of the Ashkenazi Jewish population among Ashkenazi Jewish women.
0	NA	NA	6174delT	METHODS	Since the linkage disequilibrium structure among Ashkenazi Jewish people may differ from other mutation carriers, stratifying by the *6174delT provides additional control for population stratification.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	To allow for the non-independence among related individuals, an adjusted version of the score test was used in which the variance of the score was derived by taking into account the correlation between the genotypes.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Analyses were performed in R using the GenABEL libraries and custom written software
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	To estimate the magnitude of the associations, the effect of each SNP was modelled either as a per allele hazard ratio (HR) (i.e., multiplicative model) or as separate HRs for heterozygotes and homozygotes, and these were estimated on the log scale.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The HRs were assumed to be independent of age (i.e.
0	NA	Cox	NA	METHODS	we used a Cox proportional-hazards model).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	For the most significant novel associations this assumption was verified by adding a genotype-by-age interaction term to the model to fit models in which the HR changed with age.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The retrospective likelihood was implemented in the pedigree-analysis software MENDEL as previously described.
0	breast cancer	BRCA2	6174delT	METHODS	All analyses were stratified by country of residence and 6174delT (c.5946delT) mutation status, and used calendar-year- and cohort-specific breast cancer incidence rates for BRCA2 .
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The combined stage 1 and stage 2 analyses were also stratified by stage.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Parameter estimates were obtained by maximising the retrospective likelihood.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	To allow for the non-independence among related mutation carriers, we used a robust variance estimation approach in order to obtain standard errors for the parameters.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Related individuals were identified through a unique family identifier
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	METHODS	We also examined the association of both high-frequency and low-frequency copy number variants (CNV) to the age of diagnosis of breast cancer as a dichotomous trait using the stage 1 data.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We called known, common variants (copy number polymorphisms, CNPs) with Canary.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	CNP alleles lower than 1% in frequency were removed, to maximize the number of the CNPs that were bi-allelic instead of multi-alleleic.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	CNPs were removed that had for call rate <95%, differential missingness by genotype (p<10-3), or departure from Hardy-Weinberg proportions (p<10-3).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Post-QC, we had 191 high-quality genotyped polymorphisms.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We used PLINK to assess association using logistic regression and the same ancestry covariates of no interest as with SNPs.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We similarly assessed less common CNVs discovered by Birdseye for association with age at diagnosis using PLINK.
0	NA	BRCA2	NA	METHODS	Finally, we also looked specifically at CNVs overlapping the BRCA2 gene itself using LOD scores and Birdseye
0	NA	BRCA2	NA	METHODS	We looked for evidence of excess sharing across the genome and the BRCA2 region.
0	autism	NA	NA	METHODS	Using GERMLINE, shared segments of greater than 5 cM were computed based on the imputed genotype dataset among both Ashkenazi (n = 304) and non-Jewish (n = 1,331) samples compared to samples from an autism study (n = 808) (Figure S3).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Examining sites across the genome every 2.5 cM (excluding telomere and centromere regions), we computed the mean of the proportion, standard deviation, and the maximum values for non-Jewish and Ashkenazi women, respectively
0	breast cancer	BRCA2	NA	METHODS	We tested whether 59 genes known to regulate or interact with BRCA2  (Table S1) were enriched for associations with age of onset of breast cancer in BRCA2 mutation carriers, using a new implementation of Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) called Meta-Analysis Gene-Set Enrichment of variaNT Associations (MAGENTA).
0	Fanconi anemia	BRCA1	NA	METHODS	The 59 genes were compiled using a Pubmed abstract mining software, Chilibot, and were selected if they were related to the Fanconi anemia pathway as well as others reported from literature to regulate or interact with BRCA1/2 .
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	An association p-value was calculated for each gene in the genome, defined as the most-significant association p-value of all genotyped SNPs that lie within 110 kb upstream and 40 kb downstream to the gene's most extreme transcript boundaries, followed by correction for gene score confounders (gene size, number of SNPs per gene and linkage disequilibrium related properties).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	SNP association p-values were taken from the stage 1 GWAS.
0	NA	BRCA1	NA	METHODS	To compute a GSEA p-value for the BRCA gene set, the fraction of genes with an association p-value more significant than the 95 percentile of all gene p-values in the genome was compared to a null distribution, generated by randomly sampling gene-sets of identical size from the genome 10,000 times.
0	NA	BRCA1	NA	METHODS	Of the 59 BRCA interactors, two genes were assigned the same most significant SNP due to physical proximity in the genome.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	To prevent potential over-estimation of gene set enrichment due to physical clustering of genes in a gene set, we retained only one gene of each subset of genes assigned the same best SNP (the gene with the most significant gene p-value) for the analysis of both the real and permuted gene sets
