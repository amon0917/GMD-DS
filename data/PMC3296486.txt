0	CF lung disease	CFTR	NA	INTRO	Lung disease is the major source of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF), a recessive disorder caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene.
0	lung hypoplasia	CFTR	NA	INTRO	Allelic variation in CFTR does not explain the wide variation in severity of lung disease however studies of twins and siblings demonstrate substantial heritability underlying differences in lung function measures in CF patients (h2 > 0.5).
0	CF lung disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Candidate gene studies have produced conflicting results, with only a few large scale replications accounting for a small proportion of heritable variation in CF lung function.
0	chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Identification of other genetic modifiers could identify potential mechanisms for variation in lung function in CF, as well as for common diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and suggest new targets for intervention
0	genetic diseases	NA	NA	INTRO	Whole-genome methods provide an attractive approach to identify modifier loci of Mendelian disorders.
0	lung hypoplasia	CFTR	NA	INTRO	However CF presents numerous challenges, such as: (1) collecting multiple years of lung function measures to accurately classify lung disease severity; (2) selecting the appropriate study design to identify common and rare variants; (3) accruing sufficient sample sizes, and (4) accounting for potential interaction between CFTR and modifier loci.
0	lung hypoplasia	NA	NA	INTRO	To overcome these challenges, we formed a North American CF Gene Modifier Consortium to identify modifiers of lung disease severity and other phenotypes.
0	lung hypoplasia	NA	NA	INTRO	For lung disease in CF, the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) is the most clinically useful measure of lung disease severity and is a well-established predictor of survival.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	However, comparison of FEV1 measures across a broad age range of CF patients is confounded by decline with age and mortality attrition.
0	lung hypoplasia	NA	NA	INTRO	To account for these confounders, the Consortium developed a quantitative lung disease phenotype based on multiple measures of FEV1 over 3 years that displays robust genetic influence (h2 = 0.51)
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The Consortium is composed of three samples of CF patients recruited using different study designs.
0	NA	NA	F508del	INTRO	The Genetic Modifier Study (GMS) consists of unrelated patients homozygous for the common CF allele F508del (HGVS nomenclature: p.Phe508del), recruited from extremes of lung function.
0	exocrine pancreas	NA	NA	INTRO	The Canadian Consortium for Genetic Studies (CGS) enrolled unrelated patients having pancreatic insufficiency from a population-based sample.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The CF Twin and Sibling Study (TSS) recruited families where two or more surviving children have CF.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The GMS and CGS were designed for association analysis, while the TSS was designed for both linkage and association, providing an opportunity to detect rarer variants or poorly tagged loci
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	As many current Genome Wide Association Studies (GWASs) employ sample sizes that are several-fold larger than available for the CF population, we sought to maximize power by (1) testing association using combined data from GMS and CGS, followed by replication using the association evidence from TSS, and (2) testing linkage using the TSS, followed by SNP association testing in linked regions in the unrelated patients in GMS and CGS.
0	NA	CFTR	F508del	INTRO	We also restricted analysis to patients bearing two severe loss-of-function CFTR alleles and a subset of these patients that had identical CFTR genotypes (homozygosity for F508del)
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	A total of 3,467 CF patients are represented in three study designs (Table 1, Supplementary Note).
0	pancreatic	CFTR	F508del	RESULTS	Patients in the GMS and 60% of the patients in the CGS and TSS are F508del homozygotes (F508del/F508del), while the remainder has other severe exocrine pancreatic CFTR genotypes.
0	lung hypoplasia	NA	NA	RESULTS	The three samples showed consistent distributions of the lung disease phenotype, with the mid-range under-represented in GMS due to the extremes-of-phenotype design (Figure 1).

0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Another, but more modest linkage signal was on chromosome 1p22.21, with multipoint LOD score of 2.48 for rs941031at 91.07 Mb (119 cM).
0	CF lung disease	NA	rs4811645	RESULTS	Inclusion of BMI-Z, an important covariate of CF lung function (Supplementary Table 1), increased the LOD score for the linkage peak on 20q13.2 to 5.72 (genome-wide P=5.05 x 10-4 at rs4811645 which is 0.07cM (0.13Mb) from rs4811626; Figure 5) while linkage on chromosome 1p22.21 decreased to LOD 1.67.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Thus, anthropometric measures are not major contributors to the linkage on 20q13.2 but may be playing a role on 1p22.21.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We estimated that the QTL at 20q13.2 is approaching 50% of the variation in lung function in the CF sibling pairs (Supplementary Figure 7); however, this estimate is highly likely to be biased upward due to winner's curse
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	A region of 1.31 Mb on 20q13.2, demarcated by 1 LOD unit below the maximum (when BMI-Z was used as a covariate), was analyzed for association in the combined GMS and CGS samples.

0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The success of this project reflected: 1) coordinated analysis of three independent samples of the CF population (representing ~15% of all patients in North America) where each study subject was characterized by the same quantitative measure of lung function; 2) simultaneous genotyping of samples using a single platform which allowed for data cleaning using relatedness assessments and removal of poor quality genotypes based on parent to child transmission predictions; 3) analyzing for loci with small effect sizes using association, and loci of major effect (even in the presence of substantial allelic heterogeneity) using linkage.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Moreover, we garnered increased power from an extreme of phenotype sample, while a population-based sample allowed for the development of a phenotype with external validity

0	NA	APIP	NA	DISCUSS	Interestingly, cis-eQTL signatures for APIP are reported for lymphocytes and monocytes (eqtl.uchicago.edu).
0	CF lung disease	APIP	NA	DISCUSS	Comparing the eQTLs to the direction of phenotype-genotype association suggests that increased expression of APIP may be associated with decreased lung function, implying that inhibition of apoptosis worsens CF lung disease.
0	lung hypoplasia	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This hypothesis is consistent with the emerging concepts that delayed neutrophil clearance, due to reduced apoptosis in neutrophils in the airways of CF patients, could lead to a hyperinflammatory state and more severe lung disease  and that inhibition of apoptosis contributes to goblet cell metaplasia, a central feature in CF airway pathophysiology

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Copy number variants (CNVs) were detected using pennCNV (2008Nov19 version) and genoCNV (version 1.08) using default parameters in 1103 GMS and 1301 CGS samples.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	CNVs with fewer than 5 probes or showing <1% variation were used, resulting in 3,008/4,868 probes from genoCNV/pennCNV in GMS and 3015/4663 probes for genoCNV /pennCNV in CGS.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Genotype PCs were used to control stratification
0	NA	Merlin	NA	METHODS	19,566 SNPs were selected from the Illumina platform with minor allele frequency >0.4 and r2 <0.01 between adjacent SNPs, using Merlin.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	HapMap II recombination data were used to integrate genetic and physical map positions.
0	NA	Mbp	NA	METHODS	Average inter-marker distance was 0.18 cM, or 0.13 Mbp.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Physical positions not appearing in HapMap were estimated assuming uniform recombination between known adjacent SNPs.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The average marker information content was ~0.9 (multipoint) and ~0.31 (two-point)
0	NA	Merlin	NA	METHODS	Variance components were estimated in SOLAR (Sequential Oligogenic Linkage Analysis Routines), with similar results from Merlin, using multipoint IBD probabilities obtained from Merlin.
