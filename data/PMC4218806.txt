0	diabetes	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	In the present study, we conducted a three-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify DR susceptibility loci in Japanese patients, which comprised a total of 837 type 2 diabetes patients with DR (cases) and 1,149 without DR (controls).

0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	Diabetic retinopathy (DR) remains the most common microvascular complication of diabetes, and is a major cause of visual impairment in adults worldwide.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The multifactorial etiology of DR has been postulated, but is poorly understood.
0	Type 2 diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	Several lines of evidence, such as ethnic differences and familial clustering in both identical twins with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and siblings with either type 1 diabetes or T2D, suggest that genetic factors have a role in the pathogenesis of DR, in addition to the duration of diabetes, hyperglycemia, hypertension and dyslipidemia.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Therefore, elucidation of the genetic susceptibility factors for DR is important to gain insight into the pathogenesis of DR, and may define genetic risk factors for this condition
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Initial genetic studies focused on a number of logical candidate genes for DR.
0	NA	VEGFA	rs2010963	INTRO	Among them, the genes for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFA), aldose reductase (AKR1B1) and the advanced glycation end products receptor (AGER) have been the most extensively studied; in particular, the SNP rs2010963 in the 5'-untranslated region of VEGF, which we first reported had a significant association with DR in 2002, and AKR1B1 polymorphisms (the dinucleotide repeat microsatellite in the 5' region and the SNP rs759853 in the promoter region) were confirmed by the meta-analyses performed by Qiu et al.

0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In the present study, we performed a three-stage GWAS for DR in Japanese T2D patients.
0	NA	NA	rs9362054	DISCUSS	The top SNP, rs9362054, was located in an intron of the RP1-90L14.1 gene; regional plots showed that the association signals around rs9362054 were confined to this gene region.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	RP1-90L14.1 encodes a lincRNA, a class of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that are transcribed from intergenic regions; three transcripts were mapped to this gene as splice variants, and six non-coding exons were estimated to be present by the Ensembl project.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The RP1-90L14.1 locus is widely conserved among vertebrates (Human, Rhesus, Mouse, Dog, Elephant, Opossum, Chicken, Xenopus tropicalis and Zebrafish) according to the UCSC Genome Browser.
1	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	RP1-90L14.1 is also called lnc-KIAA1009-1 by LNCipedia 2.0 (a long non-coding RNA database), because the nearest protein-coding gene on the same strand is KIAA1009; it is possible that RP1-90L14.1/lnc-KIAA1009-1 and KIAA1009 are functionally connected, since cis-regulation has been shown for many lncRNA genes
1	NA	KIAA1009	NA	DISCUSS	Interestingly, KIAA1009, also known as QN1, was originally reported to be involved in cell cycle control during retinal development, and was found to be a microtubule-associated ATPase involved in cell division.
1	NA	KIAA1009	NA	DISCUSS	Recently, it has been revealed that KIAA1009, renamed CEP162, plays a critical role in ciliary transition zone formation before ciliogenesis.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Ciliopathies comprise a group of disorders associated with dysfunction of a hair-like cellular organelle called a cilium; as cilia are a component of almost all vertebrate cells, cilial dysfunction can manifest as a constellation of features that include, characteristically, retinal degeneration, renal disease and cerebral anomalies; retinal degeneration is a common feature of ciliopathic disorders, and may be associated with retinal cell death.
1	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In this regard, the strong signal for the RP1-90L14.1/lnc-KIAA1009-1 locus in the present study could be mediated through defective ciliogenesis due to KIAA1009/QN1/CEP162 dysregulation by some lnc-KIAA1009-1 variation(s).
0	diabetes	polycystin-2	NA	DISCUSS	Although we should be cautious regarding this hypothesis, it was previously reported that transgenic rats with overexpression of a mutant cilia gene, polycystin-2, exhibited similar specific phenotypes to diabetic retinopathy, such as vasoregression and pericyte loss: furthermore, in the same transgenic rats, streptozotocin-induced chronic hyperglycemia was shown to ameliorate vasoregression and neuroglia cell loss, in agreement with the finding of a weaker association between RP1-90L14.1 and PDR than with DR (Table 3).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In addition, it was noted that the previous GWAS for DR in Chinese patients identified a signal in the locus of LRP-BBS5, and BBS5 is also known to be important in ciliogenesis
0	retinopathy and nephropathy complications	NA	rs9362054	DISCUSS	In agreement with the frequent involvement of both retinopathy and renal disease in ciliopathies, rs9362054 in RP1-90L14.1 was also significantly associated with DN (Table 3).
0	NA	NA	rs9362054	DISCUSS	It should be noted that a significant association with DN was observed independently from the severity of DR, suggesting that rs9362054 may also contribute to the development of DN.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	To our knowledge, there has been no previous study reporting the association between DN and ciliary genes.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Since the present study was not designed to identify DN susceptibility genes, further well-designed studies are required to verify the existence of any possible associations between the ciliary genes and DN
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In the present study, the stage 3 replications were mostly negative.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, possibly due to clinical heterogeneity (such as the duration of diabetes, metabolic control and medication(s) used for diabetes), the modest sample size and some bias, the replication of associations with DR appears to be difficult, as evidenced by the previous GWAS studies; i.e.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	these studies have reported only borderline associations, and there were no obvious overlapping susceptibility loci between studies.
0	NA	S1 and Table 2	NA	DISCUSS	Furthermore, in the present study, the potential susceptibility loci (Table S1 and Table 2) did not overlap
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	One of the strengths of the present study is considered to be that the homogeneity of the subjects was expected because the participants were recruited exclusively from the Kanto district (Saitama prefecture or the adjacent Tokyo Metropolitan area), Japan.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Furthermore, we took into account various clinical features, including the duration of diabetes and the HbA1c level, and the associations with PDR or DN were also evaluated in comparison to that with DR
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	There are several limitations regarding the present study that should be kept in mind.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	First, the modest sample size of the stage 1 discovery cohort had a limited power to detect susceptibility SNPs; in fact, none reached the genome-wide significance level (P = 8.1x10-8).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Consequently, the SNPs selected based on both provisional significance (P<10-3) and the viewpoint of the biological and/or bioinformatics potency in DR were proceeded for the stage 2 replication, and the two-stage analysis of stage 1 and stage 2 had sufficient power to detect susceptibility SNPs with relatively a high effect.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Second, the documented HbA1c levels were collected at only one point, and were considerably different among the cohorts.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Third, the patients with a short disease duration were not excluded from the control group, which may have reduced the power of the study, although the real duration of type 2 diabetes is considered to be longer than the clinically defined duration by several years.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Finally, the stage 3 replication was carried out, although no associations of the stage 1+2 SNPs were confirmed despite the adequate power, as described in the statistical analysis section.
0	NA	NA	rs9362054	DISCUSS	In addition, under the predefined significance threshold of 1.6x10-4 (2x8.1x10-8/10-3) according to the replication-based method, the stage 3 analysis of rs9362054 had 85% power to detect association with the genome-wide significance using GDesignPlus (StaGen Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Rather than the possibility of a false positive finding, we speculate that the substantial heterogeneity between the stage 3 and stage 1+2 studies (Table 2), as evidenced by the fact that the HbA1c levels were relatively low and the proportion of DR was the lowest among the cohorts in the stage 3 patients could have weakened the contribution of genetic factors to the development of DR.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Recently, it has been demonstrated that a substantial proportion of the associations with borderline genome-wide significance are replicable.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Therefore, further case-control studies of large well-characterized cohorts would be useful for validating the findings of the present study
1	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In conclusion, in the present GWAS in Japanese T2D patients, the most DR-associated locus, the lincRNA RP1-90L14.1, is intriguing, since the adjacent CEP162 gene plays an important role in ciliogenesis.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Taking into account the findings in previous studies of the transgenic rats and the GWAS in Chinese, the present study raises the possibility that the dysregulation of ciliary-associated genes plays a role in susceptibility to DR
