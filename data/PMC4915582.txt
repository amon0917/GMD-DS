0	NA	NA	rs7533564	ABSTRACT	A locus on chromosome 1, rs7533564 (P = 1.9 x 10-9), was associated with skin intrinsic fluorescence measured by SCOUT DS (excitation 375 nm, emission 435-655 nm), which remained significant after adjustment for time-weighted HbA1c (P = 1.7 x 10-8).
0	NA	NA	rs7533564	ABSTRACT	rs7533564 was associated with mean HbA1c in meta-analysis (P = 0.0225), mean glycated albumin (P = 0.0029), and glyoxal hydroimidazolones (P = 0.049), an AGE measured in skin biopsy collagen, in DCCT.

0	hyperglycemia	NA	NA	INTRO	Hyperglycemia and duration of diabetes are the two major risk factors for both microvascular (i.e., retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy) and macrovascular (i.e., cardiac) complications of diabetes.
0	hyperglycemia	NA	NA	INTRO	Hyperglycemia accelerates glycation, the result of nonenzymatic covalent bonding between the amino groups of proteins, lipids, or nucleic acids and reducing sugars (e.g., glucose or fructose), known as Maillard reactions.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	These early glycation products undergo further complex reactions to become irreversible advanced glycation end products (AGEs).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Glycation and accumulation of AGEs in tissues deteriorate their structural integrity and physiological function
0	long QT syndrome	NA	NA	INTRO	Skin collagens undergo glycation, and due to their long half-life (15 years), they capture decades-long glycemia.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	Skin AGEs measured in skin biopsies have been associated with macro- and microvascular complications of diabetes even after adjustment for mean HbA1c levels over time.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	However, skin biopsy is an invasive method and is not practical for large studies
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	As some AGEs fluoresce, accumulated levels of AGEs in the skin can be measured noninvasively by optical spectroscopy.

0	skin and eye pigmentation	NA	NA	INTRO	Another study found familial correlation of SF in 50 mothers and their children with T1D after adjustment for skin pigmentation and race.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Both studies suggest that shared genetic and/or environmental factors between family members influence SF.
0	glucose homeostasis	NA	NA	INTRO	Although there have been no twin studies of SF, a twin study of lens autofluorescence, a related phenotype, showed that heritability contributed ~28% to interindividual variation after adjustment for age, glucose homeostasis, and smoking habits.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	Recently, two genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of SF were performed in parallel: the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (DCCT/EDIC), including T1D subjects, and LifeLines, including mainly ND subjects.
0	NA	N-acetyltransferase 2	NA	INTRO	N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) was the only locus that exceeded the genome-wide significance threshold in both GWAS.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	These results were replicated in two independent studies of T1D subjects, the Wisconsin Epidemiologic Study of Diabetic Retinopathy (WESDR) and Pittsburgh Epidemiology of Diabetes Complications (EDC), and in an independent study of mainly ND subjects, LonGenity.
0	diabetes	N-acetyltransferase 2	NA	INTRO	The NAT2 effect appeared to be stronger in subjects with T1D with higher levels of HbA1c over time and in subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2D) compared with ND subjects, suggesting larger genetic effects in those with chronic hyperglycemia
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We believe that there is a continuum of loci with different effect sizes on SF.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Therefore, in the current study, we aimed to identify additional genetic loci influencing SF in T1D subjects through a meta-GWAS and to determine whether the identified loci show similar associations in ND and T2D subjects
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We performed a meta-GWAS of skin intrinsic fluorescence (SIF) on directly genotyped and imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from individuals with T1D of European ancestry from two studies, DCCT/EDIC and WESDR.

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Age, sex, smoking status (ever smoker vs. nonsmoker), skin tone, and eGFR at SIF measurement were also included in the model as covariates
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Br2 (http://www.utstat.toronto.edu/sun/Software/BR2/), which implements a bootstrap-based bias-reduction method to correct for the effect of the winner's curse in GWAS, was used to calculate bias-reduced effect sizes for the SNP identified to be associated with SIF1 in DCCT/EDIC (threshold for significance was 1E-5 for suggestive association).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Subsequently, the corrected beta for the identified SNP was used to estimate the required sample size to detect the effect of the identified locus among T2D and ND subjects assuming that the SNP effect is similar to its effect in T1D subjects, using QUANTO, version 1.2.4 (http://biostats.usc.edu/Quanto.html)

0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We used meta-GWAS of two T1D studies, DCCT/EDIC and WESDR, to identify a new locus on chromosome 1 associated with SIF1 (excitation 375 nm, emission 435-655 nm) at genome-wide significance level.
0	NA	NA	rs7533564	DISCUSS	The C allele of rs7533564 (T>C) was associated with higher levels of SIF1 in both studies, explaining 1.5 and 2.5% of the variation in SIF1 in DCCT/EDIC and WESDR, respectively.
0	SIF2-15	N-acetyltransferase 2	rs7533564	DISCUSS	rs7533564 showed similar associations in terms of effect direction and size with SIF2-15 (excitation 375-456 nm, emission 435-655 nm) but at slightly less significance, whereas NAT2, the previously identified locus, had the strongest association with SIF12 (excitation 435 nm, emission 470-655 nm) with much larger effect size compared with SIF1
0	NA	NA	rs7533564	DISCUSS	rs7533564 did not show similar association with SF in a large population of ND subjects (LifeLines) or in a small population of T2D subjects, suggesting that the effect of SNP on SF is restricted to T1D subjects.
0	NA	NA	rs7533564	DISCUSS	The bias-reduced effect estimate for rs7533564 on SIF1 was 0.071 in DCCT/EDIC.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	With use of this estimate, at least 1,585 subjects would be required to detect the effect with good power (1-beta = 80%) for SIF1 (mean [SE] 3.10 [0.20]) with type I error rate (two sided) 0.05 and allele frequency 0.02.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Therefore, our study did not have sufficient power to detect an association in T2D subjects (N = 376 including 318 and 58 T2D subjects from LifeLines and LonGenity, respectively) if we assume that the SNP effect is as large as in T1D subjects.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, diabetes duration was much longer in T1D subjects compared with T2D subjects, and diabetes duration is associated with higher levels of AGEs in the skin as well as SF.
0	hyperglycemia	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In addition, former intensive therapy in DCCT, which results in lower levels of HbA1c, attenuated the effect of the SNP on SIF1 in DCCT/EDIC, indicating that the SNP effect is larger in those who have experienced higher levels of hyperglycemia, and T1D subjects had higher levels of HbA1c over time than T2D subjects (Table 2).
0	hyperglycemia	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Therefore, the SNP effect may be larger in those who have been exposed to higher levels of hyperglycemia for a longer period of time and consequently accumulated more AGEs in skin.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Similarly, in ND subjects the effect size could be smaller than in those with diabetes, as they were not exposed to hyperglycemia, and larger studies would be needed to detect this.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The interaction analysis also suggested that the SNP effect on SIF differs by diabetes status: having T1D or diabetes in general (i.e., T1D or T2D) compared with ND.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The other point to consider is that in T1D subjects, SIF was measured by SCOUT DS, whereas in the majority of our T2D and ND subjects, SAF was measured using AGE Reader.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Although the two devices use similar technology, they use different protocols to correct and calculate the final value, which is reported by both in arbitrary units, and to our knowledge the two devices have never been directly compared.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We included nongenetic factors influencing SF in the model, and it is unlikely that the results were confounded by any of these factors.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Besides, the identified SNP was not associated with any except for HbA1c
0	NA	NA	rs7533564	DISCUSS	Association of rs7533564 with SIF was independent of mean HbA1c over time.
0	hyperglycemia	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, the SNP was associated with higher levels of both time-weighted HbA1c and mean GA, indicating that at least part of this association is due to hyperglycemia over decades prior to SIF measurement.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The association with mean GA appeared to be partly independent of its association with SIF, and the SNP was not associated with blood glucose levels, but both measurements were obtained during the DCCT, ~16-26 years before SIF measurement, and did not reflect glycemia when SIF was measured
0	NA	NA	rs7533564	DISCUSS	We could not confirm whether the SNP effect differed by mean HbA1c over time, as the results from DCCT/EDIC and WESDR were discrepant (e.g., rs7533564 effect on SIF1 appeared to be greater in subjects having higher levels of HbA1c over time in DCCT/EDIC, whereas the opposite was observed in WESDR) and statistically not significant, most probably due to lack of statistical power, especially in WESDR.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In addition, there were some differences between DCCT/EDIC and WESDR in terms of age, mean eGFR, and mean HbA1c over time, which makes interpreting the results difficult (Table 2).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Besides, HbA1c was measured annually in DCCT/EDIC, whereas it was measured approximately every 5 years in WESDR
0	NA	NA	rs7533564	DISCUSS	rs7533564 had positive interaction with smoking status during the 6 years prior to SIF measurement (EDIC years 11-16) and with mean caffeine during both DCCT and EDIC, suggesting that smoking and caffeine consumption could augment its effect on SIF1.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In contrast, the negative interaction between the SNP and skin tone indicated that the SNP effect could be attenuated in subjects with darker skin
0	hypoglycemia	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We could not detect any association between the SNP and incidence of severe hypoglycemia or risk of developing any of the long-term diabetes complications including retinopathy and nephropathy.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, our study may not have sufficient power to detect such associations
0	NA	G-H1	rs7533564	DISCUSS	rs7533564 was associated with higher levels of G-H1, an AGE measured by skin biopsy.
0	NA	G-H1	NA	DISCUSS	G-H1 does not fluoresce, but, interestingly, is the same AGE associated with NAT2.
0	NA	G-H1	rs7533564	DISCUSS	The significant association of rs7533564 with G-H1 implies that a process involving free serum glyoxal or glycoaldehyde is implicated in G-H1 formation and influenced by the SNP
0	NA	prostaglandin F receptor	rs7533564	DISCUSS	PTGFR is the nearest gene to rs7533564; the SNP is located 130 kb 5' upstream of the gene.
0	NA	prostaglandin F receptor	NA	DISCUSS	PTGFR produces the receptor for prostaglandin F2-alpha, a potent luteolytic agent, and is mainly expressed in the uterus (http://biogps.org).
0	pleural lung fibrosis	prostaglandin F receptor	NA	DISCUSS	PTGFR has recently been identified as a fibrosis hormone and is involved in the accumulation of collagen I and III in myocardium in insulin resistance state leading to diabetic cardiomyopathy.
0	Diabetes Complications	prostaglandin F receptor	NA	DISCUSS	Prostaglandin F2-alpha receptor silencing improves insulin resistance in T2D and has a protective effect on diabetes-induced vascular remodeling.
0	NA	prostaglandin F receptor	rs7533564	DISCUSS	rs7533564 is not a known expression quantitative trait loci for the nearby genes including PTGFR (http://www.gtexportal.org, eqtl.uchicago.edu, and http://www.muther.ac.uk [as of February 2016]).
0	NA	NA	rs7533564	DISCUSS	However, due to low allele frequency of rs7533564, expression studies could be underpowered to detect the effect.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The identified locus has not been associated with T1D or related phenotypes in GWAS.
0	coronary artery disease	NA	rs7533564	DISCUSS	The T allele of rs7533564 was nominally associated with higher levels of LDL in meta-GWAS (the opposite of its effect on SIF), but it has not been associated with the other lipids, HbA1c in ND, risk of T2D, or risk of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction (Supplementary Table 16).
0	NA	insulin	rs7533564	DISCUSS	rs7533564 was not associated with insulin sensitivity (GENESIS [GENEticS of Insulin Sensitivity] consortium) (J. Knowles, personal communication), whereas a nonsynonymous SNP in NAT2 (rs1208 [803A>G, K268R]) was strongly associated with decreased insulin sensitivity in GWAS.
0	insufficient	NA	rs7533564	DISCUSS	However, since the allele frequency of rs7533564 is 2%, insufficient power to detect its association could lead to false negative results
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In conclusion, we identified a locus on chromosome 1 associated with SIF in T1D subjects that needs confirmation.
0	Diabetes Complications	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Functional studies are required to identify the exact causal variant and affected gene in the region, which could lead to identification of new pathways involved in development of diabetes complications.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The SNP is not significantly associated with SF in ND subjects or has a much smaller effect.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our study was underpowered to detect association with SF in T2D subjects; studies with larger numbers are required.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Studies with larger sample sizes are also required to investigate association of the identified locus with long-term complications of diabetes
