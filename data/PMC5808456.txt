1	NA	ER	rs322144	INTRO	On the basis of odds ratios estimated using BCAC data for all cases with known ER status (16,988 ER negative and 65,275 ER positive), all ten new and ten previously reported and replicated susceptibility SNPs for ER-negative disease were more strongly associated with risk of the ER-negative subtype than the ER-positive subtype (Phet < 0.05, except for the new signal for rs322144 at 19p13.2; Supplementary Table 7).
1	NA	NA	rs4245739	INTRO	Two variants (rs4245739 at 1q32.1 and rs67397200 at 19p13.11) were not associated with ER-positive disease.

0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	For these 20 susceptibility SNPs for ER-negative breast cancer, we also assessed association by triple-negative status (negative for ER, progesterone receptor and HER2; Table 3), tumor grade (Table 4) and age at diagnosis (Supplementary Table 8) using BCAC data only.
1	cancers	NA	rs11374964	INTRO	Five SNPs, including the new susceptibility variants at 11q22.3 (rs11374964 and rs74911261), were more strongly associated with both risk of triple-negative disease and risk of higher-grade disease (P < 0.05); however, after adjustment for triple-negative status, heterogeneity in effect by tumor grade was observed only for the variants at 11q22.3 (rs74911261) and 1q32.1 (rs4245739) (P < 0.05).
1	cancers	NA	rs4577244	INTRO	For rs4577244 at 2p23.3, heterogeneity was observed for tumor grade only, while rs2747652 at 6q25.2 was more strongly associated with risk of other (non-triple-negative) ER-negative breast cancer subtypes (P < 0.05).
1	NA	NA	rs10069690	INTRO	At younger ages at diagnosis, associations appeared to be stronger for two variants (rs10069690 (5p15.33) and rs67397200 (19p13.11)) and weaker for one (rs2747652 (6q25.2)) (P < 0.05)
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Elsewhere, we report 65 new susceptibility loci for overall breast cancer.

0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	We assessed associations with risk of ER-negative disease, and with risk of overall breast cancer for BRCA1 mutation carriers, for SNPs at the remaining 62 loci, as well as for the 96 previously reported breast cancer susceptibility variants that were not specific to ER-negative disease.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Of these 158 SNPs, 105 were associated (P < 0.05) with risk of ER-negative breast cancer and 24 were associated with overall risk for BRCA1 mutation carriers (Supplementary Tables 9 and 10).
0	NA	BRCA2	NA	INTRO	Results for BRCA2 mutation carriers are presented in Supplementary Table 11
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Pathway analysis based on mapping each SNP to the nearest gene was performed using summary association statistics from the meta-analysis of BCAC and CIMBA data combined (Online Methods).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	This identified several pathways implicated in ER-negative disease (enrichment score (ES) >= 0.41; Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	14 and Supplementary Tables 12 and 13), including a subset of pathways that were not enriched in susceptibility to ER-positive disease (ES < 0; Supplementary Table 14).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	One of the latter subsets was the adenylate cyclase (AC)-activating pathway (ES = 0.62; Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	15).
1	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Two of the predicted target genes for the ten new susceptibility variants for ER-negative breast cancer, based on the eQTL analysis (Supplementary Table 5), ADCY3 (PTCGA = 6.7 x 10-3) and ADCY9 (PMETABRIC = 1.3 x 10-4), are part of this pathway, and their association signals were critical to the elevated enrichment scores observed (Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	14).
1	breast cancer	ADCY9	NA	INTRO	ADCY9 is stimulated by beta2 adrenergic receptor (beta2AR) signaling in ER-negative breast cancer and in turn drives AC-cAMP signaling, including, for example, mitogenic signaling through the beta-arrestin-Src-ERK pathway
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	To further explore the functional properties of the genome that contribute to heritability of ER-negative breast cancer, we conducted a partitioned heritability analysis using linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Considering 52 'baseline' genomic features, we observed the greatest enrichment for super-enhancers (2.5-fold, P = 2 x 10-7) and the H3K4me3 histone mark (2.4-fold, P = 0.0005), with 33% depletion (P = 0.0002) observed for repressed regions (Supplementary Table 15).
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	No differences in enrichment for these features were observed between susceptibility to ER-negative and ER-positive breast cancer, but baseline genomic features are not specific to cell type.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	The estimated correlation between ER-negative and ER-positive breast cancer based on ~1 million common genetic variants was 0.60 (standard error (SE) = 0.03), indicating that, although these two breast cancer subtypes have a shared genetic component, a substantial proportion of their genetic bases is distinct.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	The estimated correlation between ER-negative disease in the general population and overall breast cancer for BRCA1 mutation carriers was 0.72 (SE = 0.11)
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	In summary, in this study of women of European origin, we have identified ten new susceptibility variants for ER-negative breast cancer and replicated associations with ER-negative disease for ten SNPs identified by previous GWAS.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Most of these variants were not associated or were more weakly associated with ER-positive disease, consistent with the findings from pathway and partitioned heritability analyses showing that ER-negative breast cancer has a partly distinct genetic etiology.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	We also observed consistent associations with ER-negative disease for a further 105 susceptibility SNPs for breast cancer overall.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Together, these 125 variants explain ~14% of an assumed twofold increased risk of developing ER-negative disease for the first-degree female relatives of women affected with this subtype (the newly identified SNPs explain ~1.5%; Supplementary Table 16) and ~40% of the estimated familial risk that is attributable to all variants imputable from the OncoArray (Online Methods).
0	breast cancer	BRCA1	NA	INTRO	We have also identified 9 new breast cancer susceptibility variants for BRCA1 mutation carriers and confirmed associations for a further 30 previously reported SNPs; these 39 variants explain ~8% of the variance in polygenic risk for carriers of these mutations (Supplementary Table 17).
0	breast cancer	BRCA1	NA	INTRO	However, the lower number of risk-associated variants in disease with BRCA1 mutation may merely be a consequence of the smaller sample size, as the genetic correlation with ER-negative breast cancer is high.
0	NA	BRCA1	NA	INTRO	These findings may inform improved risk prediction, both for the general population and BRCA1 mutation carriers.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Further investigation is required for other populations of non-European origin.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Fine-mapping and functional studies should lead to a better understanding of the biological basis of ER-negative breast cancer and may perhaps inform the design of more effective preventive interventions, early detection and treatments for this disease

0	breast cancer	NA	NA	METHODS	The relative risk of ER-negative breast cancer for the first-degree female relative of a woman with ER-negative disease has not been estimated.

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	To estimate the proportion of this risk explained by the 125 variants associated with ER-negative disease, we used MAF and odds ratio estimates from the OncoArray-based genotype data and applied the formula where pi is the MAF for variant i, betai is the log(OR) estimate for variant i, taui is the standard error of betai and lambda = 2 is the assumed overall familial relative risk
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The corresponding estimate for the familial relative risk due to all variants is the frailty-scale heritability, defined as where gammai is the true relative risk conferred by variant i, assuming a log-additive model.
