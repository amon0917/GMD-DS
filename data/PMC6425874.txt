0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The HbA1c values for the genotypes AA (n = 3), AG (n = 250), and GG (n = 4,369) were 7.6 +- 1.1%, 8.3 +- 1.2%, and 8.5 +- 1.2%, respectively.
0	NA	hexokinase 1	rs906216	RESULTS	Variants rs906216 and rs7072268 in HK1 and rs12621844 near FOXN2 were also directionally consistently associated with HbA1c in FinnDiane (P < 0.05) (Supplementary Tables 13 and 14).

0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Next, we tested the combined genetic effect by creating GRS from significant variants found in the largest HbA1c GWAS (Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	7).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	A GRS-ALL comprising 55 SNPs was associated with HbA1c in FinnDiane (beta = 0.010 [95% CI 0.002, 0.018], P = 0.014) and, along with covariates, explained 2.5% of the variation in HbA1c.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	RESULTS	However, age, diabetes duration, sex, and nHbA1c alone explained 2.4% of the variation, whereas GRS-ALL explained only 0.1% of the variation in HbA1c.
0	erythrocytic leukemia	NA	NA	RESULTS	A similar amount of HbA1c variance was also explained by GRS-E including only 19 erythrocytic SNPs (beta = 0.021 [95% CI 0.005, 0.037], P = 0.01).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	In contrast, GRS-G created from the 18 glycemic variants was not associated with HbA1c (beta = 0.004 [95% CI -0.01, 0.018], P = 0.573)
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We identified a locus on chromosome 13 that show genome-wide significant association with HbA1c in 4,622 Finnish individuals with T1D.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The three associated SNPs in the locus are located <30 kb from each other and are in high LD, therefore indicating the same association signal.
0	NA	NA	rs2085277	DISCUSS	Notably, the association with HbA1c at rs2085277 and rs1360072 remained genome-wide significant in a meta-analysis including individuals with T1D from RASS.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In DCCT/EDIC and WESDR, the MAFs for the chr13 top SNPs were <=0.5%.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The low MAFs (<=1%) might explain the lack of significant replication in the T1D cohorts, since the power to detect significant association with MAF <=1% is limited.
0	diabetes	NA	rs2085277	DISCUSS	On the contrary, both SNP associations were replicated (P <= 0.013) in the East Asian population without diabetes, where the SNPs were present with high allelic frequency of 38.5% and 34.5% for rs2085277 and rs1360072, respectively
0	NA	B3GALTL	rs2085277	DISCUSS	rs2085277 is an intergenic SNP surrounded by B3GLCT (261 kb 5') and RXFP2 (146 kb 3').
0	NA	B3GALTL	NA	DISCUSS	More distant B3GLCT is a glucosyltransferase that adds glucose molecules to multiple proteins.
0	NA	relaxin family peptide receptor 2	rs2085277	DISCUSS	RXFP2 seems a more plausible candidate gene, since many SNPs in close vicinity to rs2085277 (although not in LD) have cis-eQTLs for RXFP2 in adrenal gland.
0	NA	relaxin family peptide receptor 2	NA	DISCUSS	RXFP2 is a receptor for insulin-like peptide 3 (INSL3) and relaxin, and RXFP2 is expressed at low levels in many tissues.
0	NA	relaxin family peptide receptor 2	NA	DISCUSS	ProteomicsDB shows RXFP2 expression in adrenal glands and in pancreatic islets.
0	glucose metabolism alterations	relaxin family peptide receptor 2	NA	DISCUSS	Although the pharmacology and biology of relaxin receptors are relatively well-known, we are not aware of any previous studies on RXFP2 in relation to glucose homeostasis.
0	glucose metabolism alterations	relaxin family peptide receptor 2	NA	DISCUSS	Of note, protein interaction analysis restricted to databases shows that RXFP2 is linked to the glucagon response pathway and to relevant proteins for glucose homeostasis, like GIPR and GCG.
0	NA	ADCY5	NA	DISCUSS	Interestingly, adenylate cyclase 5 (ADCY5), which has previously been linked to HbA1c and T2D, is found in the same protein interaction network.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, there is yet no experimental evidence that would link these proteins.
0	NA	relaxin family peptide receptor 2	NA	DISCUSS	Thus, the biological mechanisms by which RXFP2 possibly affects HbA1c remain to be elucidated
0	NA	relaxin family peptide receptor 2	NA	DISCUSS	RXFP2 stimulates adenylate cyclase to increase intracellular second messenger cAMP concentrations.
0	NA	relaxin family peptide receptor 2	NA	DISCUSS	The main ligand for RXFP2 is relaxin hormone, which is naturally increased in pregnancy, and it has both vasodilative and antifibrotic actions.
0	blood glycemia	insulin	NA	DISCUSS	Interestingly, relaxin might act along with insulin to control blood glucose homeostasis.
0	NA	insulin	NA	DISCUSS	This was also suggested by a study in mice, where relaxin treatment ameliorated the insulin sensitivity of mice on a high-fat diet.
0	NA	relaxin family peptide receptor 1	NA	DISCUSS	The main receptor for human relaxin is relaxin family peptide receptor 1 (RXFP1) but, to a smaller extent, relaxin is also a ligand for RXFP2
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our main phenotype was mean HbA1c, which was based on a median of 19 measurements per individual.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	One limitation of the study is that some individuals had only one HbA1c measurement.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	A single HbA1c measurement is not optimal for T1D studies, since HbA1c values tend to vary within a person over time.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	When a smaller subcohort of FinnDiane patients with three or more HbA1c measurements was studied with another method, linear mixed models, all top variants were consistently associated with HbA1c, although the effect sizes tended to be smaller.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This was maybe due to a smaller cohort (n = 4,153) and deviation from the linear trend over time (individual slopes) in the HbA1c values
0	diabetes	insulin	NA	DISCUSS	In diabetes, HbA1c values are used as an indicator of glycemic control achieved with insulin treatment or with drugs improving insulin sensitivity, the latter mainly used in patients with type 2 diabetes.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The heritability estimate for HbA1c in our study was modest but significant (h2 = 15%) and confirmed that HbA1c in T1D can hold a heritable component.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In the HbA1c GWAS in DCCT, a variant near SORCS1 was found.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We were, however, unable to replicate the finding, although the effect was in the same direction.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The lack of replication may be due to the winner's curse, which causes the effect in the discovery cohort to be overestimated, and therefore the power for replicating the true smaller genetic effect is lower.
0	NA	NA	rs1358030	DISCUSS	Here, we had 100% power to replicate rs1358030 with a beta = 0.045 [for ln(HbA1c)] and only 62% power with a beta = 0.003 corrected for winner's curse with a bootstrap method at two-sided alpha = 0.05.
0	diabetes	HFE	NA	DISCUSS	On the other hand, four variants in or near HFE, HK1, and FOXN2 originally found in cohorts without diabetes were also associated with HbA1c (P < 0.05) in FinnDiane
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Variants associated with HbA1c have mostly been discovered in large GWAS meta-analyses and have relatively small effect sizes.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Therefore, the power to replicate these variants in our study was only <=33%.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, a GRS comprising 55 SNPs associated with HbA1c in our T1D cohort, although it explained only a small part of the variation of HbA1c.
0	erythrocytic leukemia	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Interestingly, when divided into erythrocytic and glycemic risk scores, GRS-E including only 19 variants classified as erythrocytic SNPs was also associated with HbA1c, while no association was seen for the glycemic risk score.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This is expected, as the erythrocyte biology can be expected to be similar in individuals with and without diabetes, but the mechanisms affecting the level of glycemia are presumably different in individuals with T1D compared with the individuals without diabetes.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	As discussed by Wheeler et al., the genetic factors primarily affecting erythrocyte biology may result in falsely high or low HbA1c levels no longer fully reflecting the level of glycemia and, thus, in false interpretation of HbA1c
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Allele frequencies of risk variants may differ between populations, and therefore it is important to conduct genetic analyses in different populations.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Finns represent a population that has been genetically isolated from the rest of Europe, thus presenting an interesting opportunity to explore genetic variants affecting HbA1c in T1D.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Indeed, the lead SNP was observed with a markedly higher MAF in the Finnish than in non-Finnish Europeans
0	NA	relaxin family peptide receptor 2	NA	DISCUSS	To conclude, we identified a locus on chromosome 13 near RXFP2 that is associated with HbA1c in individuals with T1D.
0	NA	relaxin family peptide receptor 2	NA	DISCUSS	Further studies are needed to find out whether relaxin hormone mediates the effect of RXFP2 on HbA1c.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Since effect sizes are expected to be smaller in the population without diabetes, additional replication of the top locus as well as the search for additional genetic factors affecting HbA1c in other T1D cohorts is warranted.
0	diabetic complications	NA	NA	DISCUSS	As HbA1c has a major influence on the development of diabetes complications, it is important to continue the search for genetic variants affecting HbA1c
