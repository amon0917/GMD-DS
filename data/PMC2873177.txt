0	Alzheimer's disease	PCDH11X	rs5984894	ABSTRACT	By analyzing late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) in a genome wide association study (313,504 SNPs, 3 series, 844 cases/1,255 controls) and evaluating the 25 SNPs with most significant allelic association in 4 additional series (1,547 cases/1,209 controls), we identified a SNP (rs5984894) on Xq21.3 in PCDH11X that is strongly associated with LOAD in American Caucasians.
0	NA	NA	rs5984894	ABSTRACT	Analysis of rs5984894 by multivariable logistic regression adjusted for sex gave global P values of 5.7x10-5 in stage I, 4.8x10-6 in stage II, and 3.9x10-12 in the combined data.

0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by large numbers of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain.
0	dementia	NA	NA	INTRO	LOAD is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly, affecting approximately 10% of those aged 65 years or older.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Multiple rare mutations in the genes encoding the amyloid ss protein precursor, presenilin 1, and presenilin 2 cause an early onset familial form of AD with autosomal dominant inheritance, but the only well established susceptibility allele for LOAD is the APOE epsilon4, allele.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Twin studies indicate that susceptibility alleles contribute to as much as 80% of LOAD cases but definitive identification of other genes with LOAD susceptibility alleles has proven difficult
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	To identify novel LOAD susceptibility genes, we performed a two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) using Illumina HumanHap300 BeadChips.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In stage I, after stringent quality control, we analyzed 313,504 SNPs in 844 cases and 1,255 controls (Supplementary Methods online, Supplementary Tables 1 and 2).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Stage I subjects had ages at diagnosis/entry of 60-80 years and were drawn from three series.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Two series were assembled from cases and controls ascertained clinically at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, FL (JS: 353 AD, 331 control) and Rochester, MN (RS: 245 AD, 701 control).
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	A third, autopsy-confirmed series (AUT: 246 AD, 223 control) was assembled from the Mayo brain bank (see Supplementary Methods online for details).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In stage I, SNPs were tested for allelic association using the chi2 test implemented in PLINK (Supplementary Table 3 online).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	After adjustment for population stratification using EIGENSTRAT and Bonferroni correction for the 313,504 SNPs tested, only six APOE-linked SNPs showed genome-wide significance in stage I (Supplementary Table 3 and 4, and Supplementary Methods online)
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	In stage II, we employed SEQUENOM iPLEX technology to genotype the 25 SNPs with the most significant association in stage I (Supplementary Table 3 online) in an additional 845 cases and 1,000 controls drawn from the same three series but with ages at diagnosis/entry of over 80 years (JS: 237 AD, 260 control; RS: 276 AD, 624 control; AUT: 332 AD, 116 control) and from a National Cell Repository for AD series of 702 cases (1/family) and 209 controls with ages at diagnosis/entry of over 60 years.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The top 25 SNPs tested in stage II included 10 SNPs in the APOE region of chromosome 19 and 15 SNPs on other chromosomes.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The allelic association results for these 25 SNPs in stages I, II, and I + II are shown in Supplementary Table 3 online.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	All 10 SNPs in the APOE region showed significant association in stage II with P values ranging from 9.5x10-79 to 0.05.
0	NA	NA	rs5984894	INTRO	One of the two SNPs on the X chromosome, rs5984894, also replicated well in the stage II follow-up series with a P value of 0.0006 that retained significance (P=0.015) even after conservative Bonferroni correction for 25 SNPs tested in stage II.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	None of the other SNPs replicated in stage II.
0	NA	NA	rs1279795	INTRO	The second SNP on the X chromosome, rs1279795, had a P value of 0.43 and the 13 additional SNPs had P values of 0.28-0.98 (Supplementary Table 3 online)
0	NA	NA	rs5984894	INTRO	In stages I + II, rs5984894 was genotyped successfully in 2,356 of the 2,391 cases (99%) and 2,384 of the 2,464 controls (97%).
0	NA	NA	rs5984894	INTRO	Because our stage I and stage II subjects came from multiple American Caucasian series, PLINK was employed to test rs5984894 for allelic association in the combined stage I, II, and I + II datasets using the Mantel-Haenszel method (Table 1) in addition to the chi2 test on combined allele counts (Supplementary Table 3 online).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In the combined stage I dataset, the P values were 1.2x10-5 and 1.5x10-5 for the allelic association and the Mantel-Haenszel method respectively.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Both methods showed highly significant replication in the stage II dataset where the unadjusted P values were 0.0006 and 0.002 respectively and the Bonferroni-adjusted P values were 0.015 and 0.05.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The overall unadjusted P value for allelic association in stage I + II was 3.8x10-8 with an OR of 1.29 (95% CI 1.18-1.41), and 2.2x10-7 with an OR of 1.30 (95% CI 1.18-1.43) using the Mantel-Haenszel method (Table 1).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The Breslow Day P values calculated by PLINK to test for series to series heterogeneity were 0.95, 0.22, and 0.43 in stages I, II, and I + II, indicating a lack of statistical evidence for series to series heterogeneity among the seven series tested
0	NA	PCDH11X	rs5984894	INTRO	rs5984894 is within the gene (PCDH11X) encoding protocadherin 11, X-linked (Fig.

0	NA	PCDH11X	NA	INTRO	It has been proposed that known coding and expression level differences between PCDH11X and PCDH11Y may have functional consequences that could lead to sexually dimorphic traits.
0	NA	NA	rs5984894	INTRO	To explore this possibility, we analyzed rs5984894 by multivariable logistic regression with sex as a covariate (Table 2).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Using this approach, which specifically models each carrier group, the global P value in the combined series improved substantially to 3.9x10-12 as compared to 3.8x10-8 for allelic association (Supplementary Table 3) and 2.2x10-7 using the Mantel-Haenszel method (Table 1).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In the combined series, odds ratios were 1.75 (95% CI 1.42-2.16) for female homozygotes (P=2.0x10-7) and 1.26 (95% CI 1.05-1.51) for female heterozygotes (P=0.01) compared to female non-carriers.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	For male hemizygotes (P=0.07) compared to male non-carriers, the odds ratio was 1.18 (95% CI 0.99-1.41) (Table 2).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Male sex, which had an OR of 0.86 (95% CI 0.71-1.05) was not a significant covariate (P=0.14) in the combined data.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Female homozygotes in the combined series were at significantly increased risk not only when compared to female non-carriers (P=2.0x10-7) but also when compared to female heterozygotes (P=0.0005) or male hemizygotes (P=1.4x10-7) (Supplementary Table 5 online, model 3).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The OR for female homozygotes in stage I was 1.92 (95% CI 1.36-2.70) with a P value of 0.0002.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	This association replicated well in stage II where the OR was 1.70 (95% CI 1.29-2.24) with a P value of 0.0002 (Table 2).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The global P value of 5.7x10-5 in stage I also replicated well, improving to 4.8x10-6 on follow-up
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Replication for female homozygotes and heterozygotes was highly consistent when subjects with ages at diagnosis/entry of 60-80 years were compared to subjects with ages at diagnosis/entry of over 80 years; the ORs were 1.74 (95% CI 1.31-2.32) and 1.25 (95% CI 0.98-1.60) vs. 1.76 (95% CI 1.29-2.40) and 1.26 (95% CI 0.97-1.65) respectively (Supplementary Table 5 online, Stage I + II, model 1).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Although male hemizygotes showed significant risk (P=0.04) in stage I with an OR of 1.33 (95% CI 1.02-1.74), in stage II (P=0.74) or in all subjects with ages at diagnosis/entry of over 80 years (P=0.66) male hemizygotes showed no statistically significant evidence for increased risk with ORs of 1.04 (95% CI 0.82-1.33) and 1.07 (95% CI 0.80-1.42) respectively (Table 2 and Supplementary Table 5 online, model 1; see section on Power considerations in Supplementary Methods for additional discussion)
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Logistic regression models that included sex, age at diagnosis/entry (years over 60) and the presence of an APOE epsilon4 allele as covariates were also evaluated (Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Table 5 online, model 4).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In the combined data, age (P=4.9x10-7) and APOE epsilon4 (P<2.2x10-16) were significant covariates with ORs of 1.02 (95% CI 1.01-1.03) and 6.21 (95% CI 5.45-7.08) respectively.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	When these two covariates were included (Supplementary Table 5 online, model 4), the significant associations for female heterozygotes and homozygotes persisted with ORs of 1.23 (95% CI 1.01-1.51) and 1.68 (95% CI 1.33-2.12) respectively.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We also investigated series-to-series heterogeneity by examining series x genotype interactions in our logistic regression analyses.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Consistent with the results of the Breslow Day tests described above, these analyses provided no significant evidence for differences among series in the associations observed (data not shown)
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Using stage I GWAS data, population stratification was evaluated using the principal components approach implemented in EIGENSTRAT.
0	NA	NA	rs5984894	INTRO	Adjustment for population substructure was performed by including the top ten axes of variation generated by EIGENSTRAT as additional covariates in logistic regression analyses using an allelic dosage model and in multivariable logistic regression analyses of rs5984894.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	These adjustments to the allelic dosage (Supplementary Table 4 online) and multivariable logistic regression (Supplementary Table 5 online, model 5 vs. model 1) analyses had essentially no effect on the results obtained for the stage I GWAS data.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Thus, population substructure did not inflate the significance of stage I GWAS results, and given the similarity in the populations included in stages I and II it is unlikely that it inflated the highly significant associations observed in stage II and in the combined data
0	NA	PCDH11X	rs5984894	INTRO	rs5984894 maps to a 102kb linkage disequilibrium (LD) block on chromosome Xq21.3 that lies entirely within the gene (PCDH11X) encoding protocadherin 11, X-linked.
0	NA	PCDH11X	NA	INTRO	This LD block encompasses part of intron 2, exon 3 and part of intron 3 of PCDH11X isoforms c and d (Fig.

0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The most common haplotype (H1), which had major alleles at all 7 sites, showed highly significant association (P=3.3x10-6) with a protective OR of 0.72 (95% CI 0.62-0.83).
0	NA	NA	rs5984894	INTRO	The minor allele of rs5984894 is included in haplotypes H2, H3, H4, and H6.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Of these, H3 (P=0.04) and H4 (P=0.01) showed significant association with ORs of 1.21 (95% CI 1.01-1.46) and 1.36 (95% CI 1.07-1.74) respectively (see legend of Table 3 for additional discussion)
1	Alzheimer's disease	PCDH11X	rs5941047	INTRO	To extend our analysis of PCDH11X, three PCDH11X SNPs (rs5941047 and rs4568761 and rs2573905) that reside on the same haplotype block as rs5984894 were genotyped in all stage I + II subjects (2,524 AD, 2,698 control) from the JS (635 AD, 698 control), RS (577 AD, 1418 control), AUT (610 AD, 373 control), and NCRAD (702 AD, 209 control) series.
1	NA	NA	rs5941047	INTRO	rs5941047 and rs4568761 were followed-up in the stage II subjects because both had nominally significant P values of 0.0023 for allelic association in stage I. rs2573905 is located 8,483 bp 3' of rs5984894.
1	NA	PCDH11X	rs5984894	INTRO	Both rs5984894 and rs2573905 reside deep in intron 2 of PCDH11X isoforms c and d, over 54 kb and 62 kb upstream of exon 3 respectively.
1	NA	NA	rs2573905	INTRO	rs2573905 was genotyped in the combined series because it is in a 100 bp region that is 70% conserved between the human and mouse sequence and therefore likely to be functionally relevant.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	All three SNPs were analyzed for association with LOAD using the Mantel-Haenszel method (Table 4, see legend for results of chi2 tests).
1	NA	NA	rs2573905	INTRO	In the combined dataset, highly significant associations were observed for all three SNPs (Table 4) with P values for rs2573905, rs5941047, and rs4568761 of 1.6x10-7, 8.0x10-5 and 0.001 respectively.
1	NA	NA	rs2573905	INTRO	Breslow Day P values for rs2573905, rs5941047, and rs4568761 were 0.55, 0.35, and 0.23 respectively indicating a lack of statistical evidence for series to series heterogeneity among the seven series tested
1	NA	NA	rs2573905	INTRO	rs2573905 is in strong linkage disequilibrium with rs5984894 (r=0.98, D'=0.99) and the minor alleles of these two SNPs occur on the same haplotypes (H2, H3, H4, and H6 in Table 3).
1	NA	NA	rs2573905	INTRO	Thus functional changes caused by rs2573905 may account for the strong association of rs5984894 with LOAD.
1	NA	NA	rs2573905	INTRO	Table 5 shows the results obtained when rs2573905 was analyzed by multivariable regression with sex as a covariate.
1	NA	NA	rs2573905	INTRO	Because of the strong LD between rs2573905 and rs5984894, this analysis of rs2573905 (Table 5) gave results for female heterozygotes, female homozygotes and male hemizygotes that were nearly the same as those for rs5984894 (Table 4) although the global P value for rs2573905 was more significant in the combined series (5.4x10-13 vs. 3.9x10-12) where rs2573905 was genotyped successfully in more subjects (5,010 vs. 4,740)

0	NA	PCDH11X	NA	INTRO	In summary, the results of our two-stage GWAS provide the first evidence that genetic variation in PCDH11X is strongly associated with LOAD susceptibility in a combined American Caucasian sample of 2,391 cases and 2,464 controls.
1	NA	PCDH11X	rs5984894	INTRO	The SNP identified, rs5984894, resides in a haplotype block that falls entirely within PCDH11X, and it is in strong linkage disequilibrium with rs2573905, which is more likely to alter PCDH11X function since it resides in a conserved region.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	To date, however, no functional variants have been identified in this gene.
0	NA	PCDH11X	NA	INTRO	Further study to determine how risk for LOAD is mediated by specific genetic variation in PCDH11X should improve understanding of the molecular basis of LOAD and open new therapeutic possibilities for this devastating disease

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We eliminated four samples (two pairs) where key subject information (e.g.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	gender, age) associated with the two samples was in conflict.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Two DNA samples from different blood draws were genotyped in one RS subject where only one of the two samples was retained.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The other 13 subjects that were retained had one DNA sample derived from the brain at autopsy (AUT), which was retained, and one derived from blood taken during life (JS or RS), which was eliminated.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The duplicates in these 13 subjects went undetected because the identifiers for samples in the AUT samples, which mostly came from the brains of subjects who were not seen at Mayo, were not linked to the identifiers in the JS or RS series
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	These quality control measures left 2,099 subjects (85.2%) in whom 313,504 SNPs (98.5%) were analyzed.
0	NA	NA	rs5984894	METHODS	Since rs5984894 was not successfully genotyped in all samples that met quality control criteria, this SNP was analyzed in a total of 2,024 subjects (96.4%) in stage I
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Of the 2,099 samples that met our quality control criteria in stage I, 1,415 were RS or AUT (WGA DNA) samples of good quality.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The average call rate of 99.2% in the WGA samples was essentially identical to the average call rate of 99.3% in the 684 DNA samples from the JS series (non-WGA DNA).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Thus the call rates using BeadChips were comparable for WGA and non-WGA DNA once WGA samples of poor quality were identified and eliminated
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The genotype clusters for the 25 SNPs with the most significant P values in stage I (Supplementary Table 3) were visually inspected as an additional quality control check.
0	NA	NA	rs3858095	METHODS	This check showed that the three SNPs noted with an asterisk in Supplementary Table 3 (rs3858095, rs2318144, and rs3007421) had unsatisfactory clusters that caused inaccurate genotyping of many heterozygotes and minor allele homozygotes.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	This is evidenced by the much higher minor allele frequencies observed in controls of the follow-up series where all three SNPs were genotyped well using SEQUENOM iPLEX technology.
0	NA	NA	rs3858095	METHODS	Two of these SNPs (rs3858095 and rs3007421) were eliminated by increasing the stage I call rate cut-off for samples and SNPs from 90% to 95%, but rs2318144 was not eliminated even when the call rate cut-off for samples and SNPs was increased to 98%.
0	NA	NA	rs2318144	METHODS	rs2318144 had a Hardy-Weinberg P value of 0.05 and therefore also failed to be eliminated by our cut-off P value of 0.001.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	These results underscore the importance of checking SNPs with highly significant association by visually inspecting their genotype clusters and by genotyping follow-up series on a different platform.
0	Supplementary Figure 1a	NA	rs5984894	METHODS	The genotype clusters for rs5984894, which had a 96.4% call rate in the samples that met quality control criteria in stage I, are shown in Supplementary Figure 1a
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	A subset of the stage I samples (total n=347: JS n=84, RS n=183, AUT n=80), for which the HumanHap300 call rate was >0.90, were also genotyped using the iPLEX method employed with the stage II samples, in order to test for genotype concordance between the two genotyping platforms that were utilized.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The genotype call concordance rate between iPLEX and BeadChip for the 22 SNPs followed-up in stage II that had satisfactory BeadChip genotype clusters was 99.8%.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The genotype call discordance rates for the JS samples (non-WGA) and the RS+AUT samples (WGA) were essentially identical (JS=0.0022 vs. RS+AUT=0.0009)
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The effect of eliminating samples and SNPs using call rate cut-offs of 95% as compared to 90% (Supplementary Table 2) is discussed in Supplementary Methods online
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	To be sure that each subject was sampled one time only, stage II samples were checked for cryptic relatedness using 138 SNPs genotyped in all of those samples.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Among the samples chosen initially for analysis in stage II (1,594 ADs and 1,221 controls), there were 52 subjects in whom multiple samples had been genotyped (51 had two samples, one had three samples).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Of these 105 samples, 46 were retained and 59 were eliminated.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We retained one sample from 46 subjects where all samples had identical subject information and where we were able to confirm independently that all samples came from the same subject.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	For 6 subjects with duplicate samples, key subject information (e.g.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	gender, age) associated with the two samples was in conflict, so both samples were eliminated.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Thus we assured that a single sample was analyzed in the stage II subjects on which we report (1,547 ADs and 1,209 controls)
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	All of the iPLEX genotype cluster plots for the variants genotyped in the follow-up series were visually inspected to be sure that each genotype that was called fell within a well defined cluster.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The overall call rate for the 25 SNPs was 98.3%.
0	NA	PCDH11X	rs5984894	METHODS	Nineteen SNPs including rs5984894, the SNP in PCDH11X that showed highly significant association, had call rates of 99%.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The remaining SNPs had call rates of 93-98%.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Call rates were similar in WGA (98.2%) and non-WGA (98.9%) DNA samples.
0	NA	NA	rs5984894	METHODS	The genotype clusters for rs5984894 in stage II are shown in Supplementary Figure 1b
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Genotype reports produced by Illumina BeadStudio 2.0 software (stage I data) or SEQUENOM Typer 4.0 software (stage II data) were used to generate lgen, map, and fam files that were imported into PLINK.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	METHODS	The SNP genotypes in stage I, stage II, and the combined datasets were analyzed for allelic association with AD using the allelic association chi2 test implemented in PLINK.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	"With alpha=0.05 and Bonferroni correction for the 313,504 SNPs tested in stage I, a P value of 1.6x10-7 is required for ""genome-wide"" significance."
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Using this criterion, the only SNPs to achieve genome-wide significance in stage I were six APOE-linked SNPs.
0	NA	NA	rs5984894	METHODS	In the combined stage I + II data, rs5984894 and one additional APOE-linked SNP also achieved this level of significance (Supplementary Table 3)
0	NA	NA	rs5984894	METHODS	Since rs5984894 showed highly significant association with LOAD in stages I, II, and I + II, and this novel LOAD SNP was analyzed in seven distinct American Caucasian case-control series, we analyzed it in PLINK using not only the chi2 test on combined allele counts but also the Mantel-Haenszel method in which the Breslow Day option was employed to test for series to series heterogeneity (Table 1).
0	NA	NA	rs5984894	METHODS	We also analyzed rs5984894 by multivariable logistic regression (Table 2) as described in the Supplementary Methods
0	NA	PCDH11X	rs5984894	METHODS	The solid spine haplotype block definition in Haploview 4.0 was employed to generate a linkage disequilibrium plot of the genomic region encompassing PCDH11X and to evaluate the 7 haplotypes formed by the SNPs included in the haplotype block containing rs5984894.
