0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common and potentially blinding complication of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
0	blindness	NA	NA	INTRO	The disease affects multiple vascular and neural cell types of the retina and is the leading cause of new cases of blindness in working aged adults.
0	retinal microaneurysms	NA	NA	INTRO	The early non-proliferative DR (NPDR) stages are characterized by retinal microaneurysms, lipid and protein deposits and cotton wool spots due to damage to retinal vasculature.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The later stage, characterised by neovascularisation of the retina is called proliferative DR (PDR).
0	diabetic retinopathy/macular edema disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Patients may also develop diabetic macular edema (DME) characterized by build-up of fluid in and beneath the macula, affecting detailed central vision, with or without PDR or NPDR.
0	retinopathy	NA	NA	INTRO	The prevalence of any retinopathy among patients with diabetes is 40.3%, with a prevalence of 8.2% for sight threatening DR, classified as severe NPDR, PDR or DME
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	Longer duration of diabetes, poor glycemic control, hypertension, dyslipidemia, central obesity, smoking and high blood pressure are well-documented risk factors for ocular diabetic complications.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Genetic factors, however, also play an important role.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Family studies have shown that siblings have a greater chance of developing DR, irrespective of other risk factors and the heritable component of DR has been calculated in the range of 25-50%.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Candidate gene studies have identified numerous genetic variants that may contribute to risk, but have often been inconsistent.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are an efficient method to search for genetic variants associated with complex diseases, including DR
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Six GWAS for DR related phenotypes have been reported to date.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	The first was conducted in Mexican-Americans with type 2 diabetes with severe NDPR or PDR.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Subsequent studies in Taiwanese and Japanese participants used a similar disease definition whereas a study in Chinese patients was limited to PDR.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	The most recent study in type 2 diabetes used a composite definition of blinding DR which included patients with severe NPDR, PDR or DME and was conducted in Caucasian participants for the first time.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	Only one GWAS for DR has been reported in patients with type 1 diabetes.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	This study was also conducted in a Caucasian cohort and included patients with DME and PDR as cases.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Although many loci have been suggested through these studies, there has been limited success in replicating findings between studies, partly due to small study sizes increasing the likelihood of false positive findings and partly due to different ethnic groups and disease definitions under investigation
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Previous GWAS in Caucasian cohorts have, to date, only considered composite phenotypes.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	This may limit the results by creating heterogeneous groups with different underlying genetic risk factors.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	Therefore, we undertook a re-analysis of our previously reported GWAS in Australians with type 2 diabetes stratified by patients with PDR and those with DME, separately.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We then compared our findings to those reported in the only other published DR GWAS of Caucasian patients, reported by Grassi et al.

1	NA	MRPL19	rs1990145	DISCUSS	The top ranked SNP for DME, rs1990145 is within the second intron of the mitochondrial ribosomal protein L19 (MRPL19).
0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Although there have been no reports on this gene's involvement with diabetic retinopathy, it is expressed in the retina (The Ocular Tissue Database).
0	mitochondrial dysfunction	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Evidence suggests a key role for mitochondrial dysfunction in age-related macular degeneration.
0	mitochondrial dysfunction	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Polymorphisms in this gene may result in mitochondrial dysfunction and associated eye pathology, with underlying subclinical phenotypes unmasked by conditions of stress such as diabetes and hyperglycaemia.
0	retinitis pigmentosa	MRPL9	NA	DISCUSS	At least three other MRP genes; MRPL9, MRPL23, and MRPL39 map to genomic regions associated with retinitis pigmentosa indicating the importance of this pathway in retinal pathology.
1	NA	LINC00343	rs4771506	DISCUSS	The second ranked DME SNP, rs4771506, is approximately 80 kb from the long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 343 (LINC00343).
0	NA	DAOA	NA	DISCUSS	The nearest protein coding gene is DAOA, D-amino acid oxidase activator, approximately 350 kb upstream from the SNP.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	It is difficult to hypothesise a functional role for this SNP or the nearest genes in DME and replication of these findings is clearly required
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This study is the first GWAS of PDR in Caucasians.
1	NA	NRXN3	NA	DISCUSS	We identified suggestive association of two SNPs within LOC285626 and three SNPs within NRXN3 with PDR.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The presence of multiple SNPs at each locus with similar statistical evidence provides confidence in the findings, although, as for DME, replication and larger studies are clearly needed.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	LOC285626 is approximately 35 kb upstream of the two chromosome 5 SNPs and encodes an uncharacterised, long non-coding RNA.
0	NA	IL12B	NA	DISCUSS	The nearest protein coding gene is IL12B (Interleukin 12B), a further 33 kb upstream.
0	Type 2 diabetes	IL12B	NA	DISCUSS	IL12B is expressed in the retina (The Ocular Tissue Database) and has been implicated in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, although there are no prior reports of a role in diabetic eye disease.
1	NA	NRXN3	NA	DISCUSS	NRXN3 (Neurexin 3) is located approximately 90 kb upstream from the three associated SNPs on chromosome 14 and is strongly expressed in the retina.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The gene encodes multiple transcripts and although the exact function of each is unknown, neurexin proteins function as cell adhesion molecules and receptors in neurons.
1	obese	NRXN3	NA	DISCUSS	Genetic variants in NRXN3 have been associated with increased waist circumference and obesity, which are important risk factors for and features of type 2 diabetes and central obesity is a risk factor for DR. NRXN3 polymorphisms are also associated with smoking behaviour, which in turn is a risk factor for age-related macular degeneration although the contributory role of smoking to DR is less than for age-related macular degeneration.
1	diabetes	NRXN3	NA	DISCUSS	If NRXN3 is confirmed to be important in PDR, there may be overlapping genetic risk factors for risk of type 2 diabetes and PDR
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	None of the highest ranked SNPs in this study have previously been reported in other GWAS of DR. All but one of these studies were of non-Caucasian participants.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	If there is a genetic component to susceptibility which is linked with ethnicity, it could explain the difficulty in replicating results from these other studies.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The lack of support for SNPs found in this current study with other published GWAS does not discount their possible association with DR. Replication analyses with larger numbers of participants would provide greater statistical power to confirm their association with PDR and/or DME.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Similarly, molecular manipulation of cultured cell and animal models may be informative
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We have also directly compared the results of our DME and PDR GWAS to the only other DR GWAS of Caucasians.

0	NA	MALRD1	NA	DISCUSS	Very little is known about the function of MALRD1 (MAM and LDL receptor class A domain containing 1).
0	diabetes	MALRD1	rs17670074	DISCUSS	Another recent study on DR in a Chinese type 2 diabetic population included two SNPs within the MALRD1 gene, although an association was not found (rs17670074 p = 0.27, rs9888035 p = 0.30).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Further research is needed to understand the possible role of this gene in DR and whether ethnic differences or epigenetic effects might be responsible for the differing results
0	NA	PCSK2	NA	DISCUSS	We also show nominal association at the chromosome 20 locus near PCSK2 reported by Grassi et al.
0	NA	NA	rs16999051	DISCUSS	Due to the use of different SNP arrays in the two studies, we report results for rs16999051 whereas the earlier report was for rs737141.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The association of this SNP with PDR was very close to significance (p = 0.007) and the SNP also reached nominal significance with DME (p = 0.038).
0	Diabetes Complications	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This may suggest some overlap in the genetic susceptibility to different diabetic ocular complications, but may also be due to the number of DME patients who also have PDR.
0	NA	PCSK2	NA	DISCUSS	This SNP is located within an intron of the PCSK2 gene on chromosome 20.
0	diabetes	PCSK2	NA	DISCUSS	The proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin-type 2 gene has been well-documented in its link to susceptibility to type 2 diabetes

0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	(2011).
0	insulin-treated diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The similar trends at several SNPs may suggest that some loci are associated with DR regardless of diabetes type.
0	diabetes	NA	rs9896052	DISCUSS	Similarly, the DR associated SNP found in our original report, rs9896052, was found in the discovery type 2 diabetes cohort as well as the replication type 1 diabetes group, again suggesting that at least some DR risk factors are common between types of diabetes
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	A strength of this study is the size of the original cohort relative to other DR studies, and the detailed clinical evaluation of the participants.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Stratifying the sight-threatening phenotype of our earlier study into DME and PDR provided more homogeneous groups for analysis.
0	retinopathy	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This study is comparable in size to other published GWAS for DR phenotypes and provides a useful breakdown of data from the previously reported composite phenotype of blinding retinopathy, although we have a limited ability to detect small effect sizes.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	A recognised limitation is that 93 participants have both PDR and DME, indicating that these phenotypes may not be independent even though we have conducted the analyses separately.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This issue will affect any cohort of diabetic patients and can only be unravelled using larger cohorts and laboratory based functional testing.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	It is noteworthy that many participants have either DME or PDR, supporting the hypothesis that different factors lead to these different clinical phenotypes.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Further value could be gained from the data by a meta-analysis with other reported studies, following harmonization of phenotypes.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Imputation of un-genotyped SNPs may also reveal additional loci, however, most loci detected through imputation are also tagged by directly genotyped SNPs.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Such analyses are likely to be of limited value in this small cohort.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Replication cohorts are also required to fully evaluate the findings reported herein, particularly as genome-wide statistical significance was not reached.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Relevant basic science studies are also merited
1	NA	MRPL19	NA	CONCL	This is the first GWAS specifically targeting DME and PDR separately as ocular complications of sight-threatening DR. MRPL19 and NRXN3 have been identified as novel loci with suggestive association with DME and PDR respectively.
1	diabetes	LINC00343	NA	CONCL	Two long non-coding RNAs of unknown function (LINC00343 and LOC285626) have also been highlighted as possible candidates for these common, blinding complications of diabetes, however, further genetic studies are warranted to confirm these findings.
0	NA	MALRD1	NA	CONCL	This study has also provided supportive evidence for previously reported loci, PCKS2 and MALRD1 in DR in Caucasians.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	CONCL	Despite recent advances in treatment for diabetes related systemic risk factors and of local DME and PDR with anti-VEGF therapies and fenofibrate, many patients remain visually impaired.
