1	diabetes	LYPLAL1	rs146662075	ABSTRACT	By reanalyzing publicly available type 2 diabetes (T2D) genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data for 70,127 subjects, we identify seven novel associated regions, five driven by common variants (LYPLAL1, NEUROG3, CAMKK2, ABO, and GIP genes), one by a low-frequency (EHMT2), and one driven by a rare variant in chromosome Xq23, rs146662075, associated with a twofold increased risk for T2D in males.

0	diabetes	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Genome-wide association studies have uncovered several loci associated with diabetes risk.
0	Type 2 diabetes	AGTR2	NA	ABSTRACT	Here, the authors reanalyse public type 2 diabetes GWAS data to fine map 50 known loci and identify seven new ones, including one near ATGR2 on the X-chromosome that doubles the risk of diabetes in men
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	During the last decade, hundreds of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been performed with the aim of providing a better understanding of the biology of complex diseases, improving their risk prediction, and ultimately discovering novel therapeutic targets.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	However, the majority of the published GWAS have only reported primary findings, which generally explain a small fraction of the estimated heritability.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	To examine the missing heritability, most strategies involve generating new genetic and clinical data.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Very rarely are new studies based on the revision and reanalysis of existing genetic data by applying more powerful analytic techniques and resources after the primary GWAS findings are published.
0	genetic diseases	NA	NA	INTRO	These cost-effective reanalysis strategies are now possible, given emerging (1) data-sharing initiatives with large amounts of primary genetic data for multiple human genetic diseases, as well as (2) new and improved GWAS methodologies and resources.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Notably, genotype imputation with novel sequence-based reference panels can now substantially increase the genetic resolution of GWASs from previously genotyped data sets, reaching good-quality imputation of low frequency (minor allele frequency [MAF]: 0.01 <= MAF < 0.05) and rare variants (MAF < 0.01), increasing the power to identify novel associations, and fine map the known ones.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Moreover, the availability of publicly available primary genetic data allows the homogeneous integration of multiple data sets from different origins providing more accurate meta-analysis results, particularly at the low ranges of allele frequency.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Finally, the vast majority of reported GWAS analyses omits the X chromosome, despite representing 5% of the genome and coding for more than 1,500 genes.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The reanalysis of publicly available data also enables interrogation of this chromosome
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We hypothesized that a unified reanalysis of multiple publicly available data sets, applying homogeneous standardized quality control (QC), genotype imputation, and association methods, as well as novel and denser sequence-based reference panels for imputation would provide new insights into the genetics and the pathophysiology of complex diseases.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	To test this hypothesis, we focused this study on type 2 diabetes (T2D), one of the most prevalent complex diseases for which many GWAS have been performed during the past decade.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	These studies have allowed the identification of more than 100 independent loci, most of them driven by common variants, with a few exceptions.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Despite these efforts, there is still a large fraction of genetic heritability hidden in the data, and the role of low-frequency variants, although recently proposed to be minor, has still not been fully explored.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The availability of large T2D genetic data sets in combination with larger and more comprehensive genetic variation reference panels, provides the opportunity to impute a significantly increased fraction of low-frequency and rare variants, and to study their contribution to the risk of developing this disease.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	This strategy also allows us to fine map known associated loci, increasing the chances of finding causal variants and understanding their functional impact.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We therefore gathered publicly available T2D GWAS cohorts with European ancestry, comprising a total of 13,857 T2D cases and 62,126 controls, to which we first applied harmonization and quality control protocols covering the whole genome (including the X chromosome).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We then performed imputation using 1000 Genomes Project (1000G) and UK10K reference panels, followed by association testing.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	By using this strategy, we identified novel associated regions driven by common, low-frequency and rare variants, fine mapped and functionally annotated the existing and novel ones, allowing us to describe a regulatory mechanism disrupted by a novel rare and large-effect variant identified at the X chromosome

0	NA	NA	NA	FIG	Publicly available GWAS datasets representing a total of 12,931 cases and 57,196 controls (70KforT2D) were first quality controlled, phased, and imputed, using 1000G and UK10K separately.
0	NA	NA	NA	FIG	For those variants that were present in the DIAGRAM trans-ethnic meta-analysis, we used the summary statistics to meta-analyze our results with the cohorts that had no overlap with any of the cohorts included in the DIAGRAM trans-ethnic meta-analysis.
0	NA	NA	NA	FIG	With this first meta-analysis, we discovered four novel loci (within magenta panels).
0	NA	NA	NA	FIG	For the rest of the variants, we meta-analyzed all the 70KforT2D data sets, which resulted in two novel loci (in blue panels).
0	Type 2 diabetes	NA	NA	FIG	All the variants that were coding and  showed a p-value of  <= 1 x 10-4 were tested for replication by interrogating the summary statistics in the Type 2 Diabetes Knowledge Portal (T2D Portal) (http://www.type2diabetesgenetics.org/).

0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	As shown in Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	1, we first gathered all T2D case-control GWAS individual-level data that were available through the EGA and dbGaP databases (i.e., Gene Environment-Association Studies [GENEVA], Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium [WTCCC], Finland-United States Investigation of NIDDM Genetics [FUSION], Resource for Genetic Epidemiology Research on Aging [GERA], and Northwestern NuGENE project [NuGENE]).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We harmonized these cohorts, applied standardized quality control procedures, and filtered out low-quality variants and samples (Methods and Supplementary Notes).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	After this process, a total of 70,127 subjects (70KforT2D, 12,931 cases, and 57,196 controls, Supplementary Data 1) were retained for downstream analysis.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Each of these cohorts was then imputed to the 1000G and UK10K reference panels using an integrative method, which selected the results from the reference panel that provided the highest accuracy for each variant, according to IMPUTE2 info score (Methods).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Finally, the results from each of these cohorts were meta-analyzed (Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	1), obtaining a total of 15,115,281 variants with good imputation quality (IMPUTE2 info score >= 0.7, MAF >= 0.001, and I2 heterogeneity score < 0.75), across 12,931 T2D cases and 57,196 controls.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Of these, 6,845,408 variants were common (MAF >= 0.05), 3,100,848 were low-frequency (0.01 <= MAF < 0.05), and 5,169,025 were rare (0.001 <= MAF < 0.01).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Merging the imputation results derived from the two reference panels substantially improved the number of good-quality imputed variants, particularly within the low-frequency and rare spectrum, compared to the imputation results obtained with each of the panels separately.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	For example, a set of 5,169,025 rare variants with good quality was obtained after integrating 1000G and UK10K results, while only 2,878,263 rare variants were imputed with 1000G and 4,066,210 with UK10K (Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	1A).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	This strategy also allowed us to impute 1,357,753 indels with good quality (Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	1B)
0	Type 2 diabetes	NA	NA	RESULTS	To take full advantage of publicly available genetic data, we used three main meta-analytic approaches to adapt to the three most common strategies for genetic data sharing: individual-level genotypes, summary statistics, and single-case queries through the Type 2 Diabetes Knowledge Portal (T2D Portal) (http://www.type2diabetesgenetics.org/).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We first meta-analyzed all summary statistics results from the DIAGRAM trans-ancestry meta-analysis (26,488 cases and 83,964 controls), selecting 1,918,233 common variants (MAF >= 0.05), mostly imputed from HapMap, with the corresponding fraction of non-overlapping samples in our 70KforT2D set, i.e.

0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Second, the remaining variants (13,197,048), which included mainly non-HapMap variants (MAF < 0.05) or variants not tested above, were meta-analyzed using all five cohorts from the 70KforT2D resource (Supplementary Data 1).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Finally, low-frequency variants located in coding regions and with p <= 1 x 10-4 were meta-analyzed using the non-overlapping fraction of samples with the data from the T2D Portal through the interrogation of exome array and whole-exome sequence data from ~80,000 and ~17,000 individuals, respectively
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	To explore whether our results recapitulate the pathophysiology of T2D, we performed gene-set enrichment analysis with all the variants with p <= 1 x 10-5 using DEPICT (Methods).
0	NA	insulin	NA	RESULTS	This analysis showed enrichment of genes expressed in pancreas (ranked first in tissue enrichment analysis, p = 7.8 x 10-4, FDR < 0.05, Supplementary Data 2) and cellular response to insulin stimulus (ranked second in gene-set enrichment analysis, p = 3.9 x 10-8, FDR = 0.05, Supplementary Data 3, Supplementary Fig.

0	pancreatic	NA	NA	RESULTS	In addition, variant set enrichment analysis of the T2D-associated credible sets across regulatory elements defined in isolated human pancreatic islets showed a significant enrichment for active regulatory enhancers (Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	4), suggesting that causal SNPs within associated regions have a regulatory function, as previously reported
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The three association strategies allowed us to identify 57 genome-wide significant associated loci (p <= 5 x 10-8), of which seven were not previously reported as associated with T2D (Table 1).
1	NA	CCND2	rs76895963	RESULTS	The remaining 50 loci have been previously reported and included, for example, two low-frequency variants recently discovered in Europeans, one located within one of the CCND2 introns (rs76895963), and a missense variant within the PAM gene.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Furthermore, we confirmed that the magnitude and direction of the effect of all the associated variants (p <= 0.001) were highly consistent with those reported previously (rho = 0.92, p = 1 x 10-248, Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	5).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	In addition, the direction of effect was consistent with all 139 previously reported variants, except three that were discovered in east and south Asian populations (Supplementary Data 4)
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The high coverage of genetic variation ascertained in this study allowed us to fine-map known and novel loci, providing more candidate causal variants for downstream functional interpretations.

0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	the subset of variants that have, in aggregate, 99% probability of containing the true causal variant for all 57 loci (Supplementary Data 5).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	As an important improvement over previous T2D genetic studies, we identified small structural variants within the credible sets, consisting mostly of insertions and deletions between 1 and 1,975 nucleotides.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	In fact, out of the 8,348 variants included within the credible sets for these loci, 927 (11.1%) were indels, of which 105 were genome-wide significant (Supplementary Data 6).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Interestingly, by integrating imputed results from 1000G and UK10K reference panels, we gained up to 41% of indels, which were only identified by either one of the two reference panels, confirming the advantage of integrating the results from both reference panels.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Interestingly, 15 of the 71 previously reported loci that we replicated (p <= 5.3 x 10-4 after correcting for multiple testing) have an indel as the top variant, highlighting the potential role of this type of variation in the susceptibility for T2D.
0	NA	IGF2BP2	NA	RESULTS	For example, within the IGF2BP2 intron, a well-established and functionally validated locus for T2D, we found that 12 of the 57 variants within its 99% credible set correspond to indels with genome-wide significance (5.6 x 10-16 < p < 2.4 x 10-15), which collectively represented 18.4% posterior probability of being causal
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	To prioritize causal variants within all the identified associated loci, we annotated their corresponding credible sets using the Variant Effector Predictor (VEP) for coding variants (Supplementary Data 7), and the Combined Annotation-Dependent Depletion (CADD) and LINSIGHT tools for non-coding variation (Supplementary Data 8 and 9).

0	NA	NA	rs146662075	RESULTS	As a complementary replication analysis, within one of the case-control studies, there was a nested prospective cohort study, the Inter99, which consisted of 1,652 nondiabetic male subjects genotyped for rs146662075, of which 158 developed T2D after 11 years of follow-up.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	RESULTS	Analysis of incident diabetes in this cohort confirmed the association with the same allele, as previously seen in the case-control studies, with carriers of the rare T allele having increased risk of developing incident diabetes, compared to the C carriers (Cox-proportional hazards ratio (HR) = 3.17 [1.3-7.7], p = 0.011, Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	3b).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Nearly 30% of carriers of the T risk allele developed incident T2D during 11 years of follow-up, compared to only 10% of noncarriers
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	To understand the strong degree of heterogeneity observed after adding the replication datasets, we compared the clinical and demographic characteristics of the discovery and replication cohorts, and found that the majority of the replication datasets contained control subjects that were significantly younger than 55 years, the average age at the onset of T2D reported in this study and in Caucasian populations.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	This was particularly clear for the Danish cohort (age controls [95%CI] = 46.9 [46.6-47.2] vs. age cases [95%CI] = 60.7 [60.4-61.0]) and for INTERACT (age controls [95%CI] = 51.7 [51.4-52.1] vs. age cases [95%CI] = 54.8 [54.6-55.1]; Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	10).
0	diabetes	NA	NA	RESULTS	Given the supporting results with the Inter99 prospective cohort, we performed an additional analysis using a stricter definition of controls, to minimize the presence of prediabetics or individuals that may further develop diabetes after reaching the average age at the onset.
0	glucose homeostasis	NA	NA	RESULTS	For this, we applied two additional exclusion criteria: (i) subjects younger than 55 years and (ii), when possible, excluding individuals with measured 2- h plasma glucose values during oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) above 7.8 mmol l-1, a threshold employed to identify impaired glucose tolerance (prediabetes), or controls with family history of T2D, both being strong risk factors for developing T2D.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	While the application of the first filter alone did not yield genome-wide significant results (Supplementary Fig.
0	prediabetes	NA	NA	RESULTS	9B), upon excluding individuals with prediabetes or a family history of T2D, the replication results were significant and consistent with the initial discovery results (OR = 1.57 [1.19-2.07], p = 0.0014).
0	NA	NA	rs146662075	RESULTS	The combined analysis of the discovery and replication cohorts resulted in genome-wide significance, confirming the association of rs146662075 with T2D (OR = 1.95 [1.56-2.45], p = 7.8 x 10-9, Fig.

0	NA	NA	rs146662075	RESULTS	The credible set of this region contained three variants, with the leading SNP alone (rs146662075), showing 78% posterior probability of being causal (Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	7, Supplementary Data 5), as well as the highest CADD (scaled C-score = 15.68; Supplementary Data 8), and LINSIGHT score (Supplementary Data 9).
0	NA	AGTR2	rs146662075	RESULTS	rs146662075 lies within a chromosomal region enriched in regulatory (DNase I) and active enhancer (H3K27ac) marks, between the AGTR2 (at 103 kb) and the SLC6A14 (at 150 kb) genes.
0	insulin deficiency	AGTR2	NA	RESULTS	The closest gene AGTR2, which encodes for the angiotensin II receptor type 2, has been previously associated with insulin secretion and resistance.
0	pancreatic	AGTR2	NA	RESULTS	From the analysis of available epigenomic data sets, we found no evidences of H3K27ac or other enhancer regulatory marks in human pancreatic islets; whereas a significant association was observed between the presence of H3K27ac enhancer marks and the expression of AGTR2 across multiple tissues (Fisher test p = 4.45 x 10-3), showing the highest signal of both H3K27ac and AGTR2 RNA-seq expression, but not with other genes from the same topologically associated domain (TAD), in fetal muscle (Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	4a; Supplementary Figure 11)
0	NA	NA	rs146662075	RESULTS	We next studied whether the region encompassing the rs146662075 variant could act as a transcriptional enhancer and whether its activity was allele-specific.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	For this, we linked the DNA region with either the T (risk) or the C (non-risk) allele, to a minimal promoter and performed luciferase assays in a mouse myoblast cell line.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The luciferase analysis showed an average 4.4-fold increased activity for the disease-associated T allele, compared to the expression measured with the common C allele, suggesting an activating function of the T allele, or a repressive function of the C allele (Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	4b).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Consistent with these findings, electrophoretic mobility shift assays using nuclear protein extracts from mouse myoblast cell lines, differentiated myotubes, and human fetal muscle cell line, revealed sequence-specific binding activity of the C allele, but not the rare T allele (Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	4c).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Overall, these data indicate that the risk T allele prevents the binding of a nuclear protein that is associated with decreased activity of an AGTR2-linked enhancer
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Through harmonizing and reanalyzing publicly available T2D GWAS data, and performing genotype imputation with two whole-genome sequence-based reference panels, we are able to perform deeper exploration of the genetic architecture of T2D.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This strategy allowed us to impute and test for association with T2D more than 15 million of high-quality imputed variants, including low-frequency, rare, and small insertions and deletions, across chromosomes 1-22 and X
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The reanalysis of these data confirmed a large fraction of already-known T2D loci, and identified novel potential causal variants by fine mapping and functionally annotating each locus
1	NA	LYPLAL1	NA	DISCUSS	This reanalysis also allowed us to identify seven novel associations, five driven by common variants in or near LYPLAL1, NEUROG3, CAMKK2, ABO, and GIP; a low-frequency variant in EHMT2, and a rare variant in the X chromosome.
0	NA	AGTR2	NA	DISCUSS	This rare variant identified in Xq23 chromosome was located near the AGTR2 gene, and showed nearly twofold increased risk for T2D in males, which represents, to our knowledge, the largest effect size identified so far in Europeans, and a magnitude similar to other variants with large effects  identified in other populations
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our study complemented other efforts that also aim at unraveling the genetics behind T2D through the generation of new genetic data.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	For example, we provided for the first time a comprehensive coverage of structural variants, which point to previously unobserved candidate causal variants in known and novel loci, as well as a comprehensive coverage of the X chromosome through sequence-based imputation
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This study also highlights the importance of a strict classification of both cases and controls, in order to identify rare variants associated with disease.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our initial discovery of the Xq23 locus was only replicated when the control group was restricted to T2D-free individuals who were older than 55 years (average age at the onset of T2D), had normal glucose tolerance, and no family history of T2D.
0	NA	TBC1D4	NA	DISCUSS	This is in line with previous results obtained for a T2D population-specific variant found in Inuit within the TBC1D4 gene, which was only significant when using OGTT as criteria for classifying cases and controls, but not when using HbA1c.
0	NA	NA	rs146662075	DISCUSS	Our observation that 30% of the rs146662075 risk allele carriers developed T2D over 11 years of follow-up, compared to 10% of noncarriers, further supports the association of this variant and suggests that an early identification of these subjects through genotyping may be useful to tailor pharmacological or lifestyle intervention to prevent or delay the onset of T2D
0	NA	AGTR2	NA	DISCUSS	Using binding and gene-reporter analyses, we demonstrated a functional role of this variant and proposed a possible mechanism behind the pathophysiology of T2D in T risk allele carriers, in which this rare variant could favor a gain of function of AGTR2, previously associated with insulin resistance.
0	NA	AGTR2	NA	DISCUSS	AGTR2 appears, therefore, as a potential therapeutic target for this disease, which would be in line with previous studies showing that the blockade of the renin-angiotensin system in mice and in humans prevents the onset of T2D, and restores normoglycemia
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Overall, beyond our significant contribution toward expanding the number of genetic associations with T2D, our study also highlights the potential of the reanalysis of public data, as a complement to large studies that use newly generated data.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This study informs the open debate in favor of data sharing and democratization initiatives, for investigating the genetics and pathophysiology of complex diseases, which may lead to new preventive and therapeutic applications
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	In order to assess genotype imputation quality and to determine an accurate post-imputation quality filter, we made use of the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) data available through the European Genotype Archive (EGA, https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/studies/EGAS00000000028).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The genotyping data and the subjects included in the following tests were filtered according to the guidelines provided by the WTCCC, whose criteria of exclusion are in line with standard quality filters for GWAS.
1	NA	NA	Ser58Phe	METHODS	We used the 1958 British Birth cohort (~3,000 samples, 58C) that was genotyped by Affymetrix v6.0 and Illumina 1.2M chips.
1	NA	NA	Ser58Phe	METHODS	After applying the quality-filtering criteria, 2,706 and 2,699 subjects from the Affymetrix and Illumina data, respectively, were available for the 58C samples, leaving an intersection of 2,509 individuals genotyped by both platforms.
1	NA	NA	Ser58Phe	METHODS	After variant quality filtering and excluding all the variants with minor allele frequency (MAF) below 0.01, 717,556, and 892,516 variants remained for 58C Affymetrix and Illumina platforms, respectively
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We used a two-step genotype imputation approach based on prephasing the study genotypes into full haplotypes with SHAPEIT2 to ameliorate the computational burden required for genotype imputation through IMPUTE2.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We used the GTOOL software (http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/~cfreeman/software/gwas/gtool.html, version 0.7.5) to homogenize strand annotation by merging the imputed results obtained from each set of genotyped data.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	To ensure that there were no strand orientation issues, we excluded all C/G and A/T SNPs.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	To perform genotype imputation, we used two sequence-based reference panels: the 1000G Phase1 (June 2014) release and the UK10K
1	NA	NA	Ser58Phe	METHODS	We evaluated genotype imputation for each reference panel considering 2,509 58C individuals that were genotyped by both independent genotyping platforms.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Four scenarios were considered: (a) fraction of variants originally genotyped (GT) by both Illumina (IL) and Affymetrix (Affy) platforms (both GT), (b) variants genotyped by Affy, but not present in IL array (Affy GT), (c) variants genotyped by IL, but not present in the Affy array (IL GT), and (d) variants not typed in IL nor in the Affy arrays, and therefore, imputed from IL and Affy data sets (d).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	This last scenario comprised the largest fraction of variants
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	As the individuals typed (and imputed) using Affy and IL SNPs as backbones were the same, we expected no statistical differences when comparing the allele and genotype frequencies with any of the variants.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The quality of the imputed variants was evaluated using the allelic dosage R2 correlation coefficient, between the genotype dosages estimated when imputing using Affy or IL as the backbone.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The Affy GT and IL GT SNPs were used to evaluate the correspondence between the allelic dosage R2 scores and the IMPUTE2 info scores for the imputed genotypes.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The linear model, between the allelic dosage R2 and the IMPUTE2-info, was used to set an info score threshold of 0.7, which corresponds to an allelic dosage R2 of 0.5.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The correlation between R2 and info score was uniform across all reference panels and platforms
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We collected genetic individual-level data for T2D case/control studies from five independent datasets, Gene Environment-Association Studies initiative [GENEVA], Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium [WTCCC], Finland-United States Investigation of NIDDM Genetics [FUSION], Resource for Genetic Epidemiology Research on Aging [GERA], and the Northwestern NUgene project [NuGENE] publicly available in the dbGaP (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap) and EGA (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/home) public repositories, comprising a total of 13,201 cases and 59,656 controls (for the description of each cohort, see Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Data 1)
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Each dataset was independently harmonized and quality controlled with a three-step protocol, including two stages of SNP removal and an intermediate stage of sample exclusion.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The exclusion criteria for variants were (i) missing call rate >= 0.05, (ii) significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) p <= 1 x 10-6 for controls and p <= 1 x 10-20 for the entire cohort, (iii) significant differences in the proportion of missingness between cases and controls p <= 1 x 10-6, and (iv) MAF < 0.01 (for the GERA cohort, we considered a MAF of 0.001).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The exclusion criteria for samples were i) gender discordance between the reported and genetically predicted sex, ii) subject relatedness (pairs with pi >= 0.125 from which we removed the individual with the highest proportion of missingness), iii) missing call rates per sample >= 0.02, and iv) population structure showing more than four standard deviations within the distribution of the study population according to the first four principal components
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We performed genotype imputation independently for each cohort by prephasing the genotypes to whole haplotypes with SHAPEIT2 and then, we performed genotype imputation with IMPUTE2.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We tested for association with additive logistic regression using SNPTEST, seven derived principal components sex, age, and body-mass index (BMI), except for WTCCC, for which  age and BMI were not available (Supplementary Data 1).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	To maximize power and accuracy, we combined the association results from 1000G Phase1 integrated haplotypes (June, 2014) and UK10K (http://www.uk10k.org/) reference panels by choosing for each variant, the reference panel that provided the best IMPUTE2 info score.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	"For 1000G-based genotype imputation in chromosome X (chrX), we used the ""v3.macGT1"" release (August, 2012)."
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	For chrX, we restricted the analysis to non-pseudoautosomal (non-PAR) regions and stratified the association analysis by sex to account for hemizygosity for males, while for females, we followed an autosomal model.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Also, we did not apply HWE filtering in the X chromosome variants.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Finally, for the GERA cohort due to the large computational burden that comprises the whole genotype imputation process in such a large sample size, we randomly split this cohort into two homogeneous subsets of ~30,000 individuals each, in order to minimize the memory requirements
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We included variants with IMPUTE2 info score >= 0.7, MAF >= 0.001, and for autosomal variants, HWE controls p > 1 x 10-6.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Further details about genotype imputation and covariate information used in association testing are summarized in Supplementary Data 1
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We meta-analyzed the different sets from the 70KforT2D data set with METAL, using the inverse variance-weighted fixed effect model.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We included variants with I2 heterogeneity < 75.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	This filter was not applied to the final X chromosome data set, after meta-analyzing the results from males and females separately (which were already filtered by I2 < 75)
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	For the meta-analysis with the DIAGRAM trans-ethnic study, we excluded from the whole 70KforT2D datasets those cohorts that overlapped with the DIAGRAM data.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Therefore, we meta-analyzed the GERA and NuGENE cohorts (7,522 cases and 50,446 controls) from the 70KforT2D analysis with the trans-ethnic summary statistics results.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	As standard errors were not provided for the DIAGRAM trans-ethnic meta-analysis, we performed a sample size based meta-analysis, which converts the direction of the effect and the p-value into a Z-score.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	In addition, we also performed an inverse variance-weighted fixed effect meta-analysis to estimate the final effect sizes.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	This approach required the estimation of the beta and standard errors from the summary statistics (p-value and odds ratio)
0	Type 2 diabetes	NA	NA	METHODS	For the meta-analysis of coding low-frequency variants with the Type 2 Diabetes Knowledge Portal (T2D Portal), we included from the 70KforT2D data set the NuGENE and GERA cohorts (7,522 cases and 50,446 controls), to avoid overlapping samples.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Like in the previous scenario, standard errors were not provided for the T2D Portal data and we used a sample size based meta-analysis with METAL.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	However, to estimate the effect sizes, we also calculated the standard errors from the p-values and odds ratios, and we performed an inverse variance-weighted fixed effect meta-analysis
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	See further details about the cohorts in Supplementary Note 1
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Summary statistics that resulted from the 70KforT2D meta-analysis were analyzed by Data-driven Expression-Prioritized Integration for Complex Traits (DEPICT) to prioritize likely causal genes, to highlight enriched pathways, and to identify the most relevant tissues/cell types; DEPICT relies on publicly available gene sets (including molecular pathways) and leverages gene expression data from 77,840 gene expression arrays, to perform gene prioritization and gene-set enrichment based on predicted gene function and the so-called reconstituted gene sets.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	A reconstituted gene set contains a membership probability for each gene and conversely, each gene is functionally characterized by its membership probabilities across 14,461 reconstituted gene sets.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	As an input to DEPICT, we used all summary statistics from autosomal variants with p < 1 x 10-5 in the 70KforT2D meta-analysis.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We used an updated version of DEPICT, which handled 1000G Phase1-integrated haplotypes (June 2014, www.broadinstitute.org/depict).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	DEPICT was run using 3,412 associated SNPs (p < 1 x 10-5), from which we identified independent SNPs using PLINK and the following parameters: --clump-p1 5e-8, --clump-p2 1e-5, --clump-r2 0.6, and --clump-kb 250.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We used LD r2 > 0.5 distance to define locus limits yielding 70 autosomal loci comprising 119 genes (note that this is not the same locus definition that we used elsewhere in the text).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We ran DEPICT with default settings, i.e., using 500 permutations to adjust for bias and 50 replications to estimate false discovery rate (FDR).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We used normalized expression data from 77,840 Affymetrix microarrays to reconstitute gene sets.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The resulting 14,461 reconstituted gene sets were tested for enrichment analysis.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	A total of 209 tissue or cell types expression data assembled from 37,427 Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 Array samples were used for enrichment in tissue/cell-type expression.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	DEPICT identified 103 reconstituted gene sets significantly enriched (FDR < 5%) for genes found among the 70 loci associated to T2D.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We did not consider reconstituted sets in which genes of the original gene set were not nominally enriched (Wilcoxon rank-sum test), as these are expected to be enriched in the reconstituted gene set by design.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The lack of enrichment makes the interpretation of the reconstituted gene set challenging because the label of the reconstituted gene set will not be accurate.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Hence, the following reconstituted gene sets were removed from the results (Wilcoxon rank sum and P-values in parentheses): MP:0004247 gene set (p = 0.73), GO:0070491 gene set (p = 0.14), MP:0004086 gene set (p = 0.17), MP:0005491 gene set (p = 0.54), GO:0005159 gene set (p = 0.04), MP:0005666 gene set (p = 0.05), ENSG00000128641 gene set (p = 0.02), MP:0006344 gene set (p = 0.42), MP:0004188 gene set (p = 0.22), MP:0002189 gene set (p = 0.02), MP:0000003 gene set (p = 0.08), ENSG00000116604 gene set (p = 0.13), GO:0005158 gene set (p = 0.07), and MP:0001715 gene set (p = 0.01).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	After applying the filters described above, there were 89 significantly enriched reconstituted gene sets.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We used the affinity propagation tool to cluster related reconstituted gene sets (network diagram script available from https://github.com/perslab/DEPICT)
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We also used the VSE R package to compute the enrichment or depletion of genetic variants comprised in the 57 credible sets listed in Supplementary Data 5 across regulatory genomic annotations, as described in.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Each GWAS lead variant from the final meta-analysis was considered as a tag SNP and variants from the corresponding 99% credible set (Supplementary Data 5) in LD with the tag SNP (R2 >= 0.4), as a cluster or associated variant set (AVS).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	In order to account for the size and structure of the AVS, a null distribution was built based on random permutations of the AVS.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Each permuted variant set was matched to the original AVS, cluster by cluster using HapMap data by size and structure.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	This Matched Random Variant Set (MRVS) was calculated using 500 permutations.

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Credible sets of variants are analogous to confidence intervals as we assume that the credible set for each associated region contains, with 99% probability, the true causal SNP if this has been genotyped or imputed.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The credible set construction provides, for each variant placed within a certain associated locus, a posterior probability of being the causal one.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We estimated the approximate Bayes' factor (ABF) for each variant aswher
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The beta and the SE are the estimated effect size and the corresponding standard error resulting from testing for association under a logistic regression model.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The posterior probability for each variant was obtained aswhere ABFi corresponds to the approximate Bayes' factor for the marker i and T represents the sum of all the ABF values from the candidate variants enclosed in the interval being evaluated.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	This calculation assumes that the prior of the beta corresponds to a Gaussian with mean 0 and variance 0.04, which is also the same prior commonly employed by SNPTEST, the program being used for calculating single-variant associations
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Finally, we ranked variants according to the ABF (in decreasing order) and from this ordered list, we calculated the cumulative posterior probability.

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The 99% credible sets of variants for each of the 57 GWAS-significant regions are summarized in Supplementary Data 5
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We examined whether indels from the 99% credible sets were present or absent in the 1000G Phase1 or UK10K reference panels, and also checked whether they were present or not in the 1000G Phase3 reference panel.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	All the information has been summarized in Supplementary Data 6.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We also visually inspected the aligned BAM files of the most relevant indels from both projects to discard that they could be alignment artifacts
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	To determine the effect of 99% credible set variants on genes, transcripts, and protein sequence, we used the variant effect predictor (VEP, GRCh37.p13 assembly).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The VEP application determines the effect of variants (SNPs, insertions, deletions, CNVs, or structural variants) on genes, transcripts, proteins, and regulatory regions.

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We obtained the scaled C-score (PHRED-like scaled C-score ranking each variant with respect to all possible substitutions of the human genome) metric for each 99% credible set variant, as it highly ranks causal variants within individual genome sequences (Supplementary Data 8).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We also used the LINSIGHT score to prioritize functional variants, which measures the probability of negative selection on noncoding sites by combining a generalized linear model for functional genomic data with a probabilistic model of molecular evolution.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	For each credible set variant, we retrieved the precomputed LINSIGHT score at that particular nucleotide site, as well as the mean LINSIGHT precomputed score for a region of 20 bp centered on each credible set variant, respectively (https://github.com/CshlSiepelLab/LINSIGHT).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	These metrics are summarized in Supplementary Data 9
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	In order to prioritize functional regulatory variants, we used the V6 release from the GTEx data that provides gene-level expression quantifications and eQTL results based on the annotation with GENCODE v19.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	This release included 450 genotyped donors, 8,555 RNA-seq samples across 51 tissues, and two cell lines, which led to the identification of eQTLs across 44 tissues.
0	pancreatic	NA	NA	METHODS	Moreover, RNA-seq data from human pancreatic islets from 89 deceased donors cataloged as eQTLs and exon use (sQTL) were also integrated with the GWAS data to prioritize candidate regulatory variants but in pancreatic islets, which is a target tissue for T2D.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Both analyses are summarized in Supplementary Data 10 and Supplementary Data 11, respectively
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	To confirm the independence between novel loci and previously known T2D signals, we performed reciprocal conditional analyses (Supplementary Data 5, Supplementary Data 12, Supplementary Data 13, and Supplementary Data 14).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We included the conditioning SNP as a covariate in the logistic regression model, assuming that every residual signal that arises corresponds to a secondary signal independent from this conditioning SNP.
1	NA	EHMT2	NA	METHODS	We applied this method to the EHMT2 locus (less than 1Mb away from the HLA where T2D and T1D signals have been identified), to confirm that this association was independent of previously reported T2D signals and also to discard that this association is also driven by possible contamination of T1D diagnosed as T2D cases.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We conditioned on the top variant identified in this study and the top variant from the 99% credible set analysis, but also on the top variants previously described for T2D and T1D.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	For this purpose, we used the full 70KforT2D resource (NuGENE, GERA, FUSION, GENEVA, and WTCCC cohorts imputed with 1000G and UK10K reference panels).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Finally, all the results were meta-analyzed as explained in previous sections.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	These analyses are provided in Supplementary Data 13.
1	NA	CAMKK2	rs3794205	METHODS	This approach was also applied to confirm that the novel CAMKK2 signal at rs3794205 is independent of known T2D signals at the HNF1A locus (rs1169288, rs1800574, and chr12:121440833:D), which is summarized in Supplementary Data 12.
0	NA	DUSP9	NA	METHODS	Moreover, this approach confirmed known secondary signals in the 9p21 locus which allowed us to build 99% credible sets based on the results from the conditional analyses (included in Supplementary Data 5), and allowed us to identify the most likely causal variant for the DUSP9 locus (Supplementary Data 14)
0	NA	NA	rs146662075	METHODS	To replicate the association of the rs146662075 variant, we performed genotype imputation with the UK10K reference panel in four independent data sets: the InterAct case-cohort study, the Slim Initiative in Genomic Medicine for the Americas (SIGMA) consortium GWAS data set, the Partners HealthCare Biobank (Partners Biobank) data set, and the UK Biobank cohort.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Phasing was performed with SHAPEIT2 and the IMPUTE2 software was used for genotype imputation
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The current UK Biobank data release did not contain imputed data for the X chromosome, for which phasing and imputation had to be analyzed in-house.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The data release used comprises X chromosome QCed genotypes of 488,377 participants, which were assayed using two arrays sharing 95% of marker content (Applied BiosystemsTM UK BiLEVE AxiomTM Array and the Applied BiosystemsTM UK Biobank AxiomTM Array).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We included samples and markers that were used as input for phasing by UK Biobank investigators.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	At the sample level, we also excluded women, individuals with missing call rate > 5% or showing gender discordance between the reported and the genetically predicted sex.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	At the variant level, we excluded markers with MAF < 0.1% and with missing call rate > 5%.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The final set of 16,463 X chromosome markers and 222,725 male individuals was split into six subsets due to the huge computational burden that would require phasing into whole haplotypes the entire data set.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We also excluded indels, variants with MAF < 1%, and variants showing deviation of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium with p < 1 x 10-20 before the imputation step.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	In addition, from those pairs of relatives reported to be third degree or higher according to UK Biobank, we excluded from each pair the individual with the lowest call rate.
0	diabetes	NA	rs146662075	METHODS	We then tested the rs146662075 variant for association with type 2 diabetes using SNPTEST v2.5.1 and the threshold method.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	METHODS	To avoid contamination from other types of diabetes mellitus, we excluded from the entire sample data set, individuals with ICD10 codes falling in any of these categories: E10 (insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus), E13 (other specified diabetes mellitus), and E14 (unspecified diabetes mellitus).
0	Type 2 diabetes	NA	NA	METHODS	Then, we designated as T2D cases those individuals with E11 (non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus) ICD10 codes, and the rest as controls.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	METHODS	Moreover, we only kept as control subjects those individuals without reported family history of diabetes mellitus and older than 55 years, which is the average age at the onset of T2D
0	NA	NA	rs146662075	METHODS	We also genotyped de novo the rs146662075 variant with KASPar SNP genotyping system (LGC Genomics, Hoddeson, UK) in the Danish cohort, which comprises data from five sample sets (Supplementary Note 2 also for the genotyping and QC analysis for this variant)
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We used Cox-proportional hazard regression models to assess the association of the variant with the risk of incident T2D in 1,652 nondiabetic male subjects genotyped in the Inter99 cohort (part of the Danish cohort) that were followed for 11 years on average.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The follow-up analysis was restricted to male individuals younger than 45 years who were 56 years old after 11 years of follow-up.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	METHODS	Individuals with self-reported diabetes at the baseline examination and individuals present in the Danish National diabetes registry before the baseline examination were also excluded.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	To include the follow-up study as a part of the replication cohorts, we used a meta-analysis method that accounts for overlapping samples (MAOS), as we had to control for the sample overlap between the follow-up and the case-control study from the Danish samples
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	See Supplementary Note 2 for a larger description of each of the five replication cohorts and how they have been processed
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We meta-analyzed the association results from these five replication data sets with the 70KforT2D data sets.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	In the final meta-analysis, we excluded whenever it was possible (a) controls younger than 55 years and (b) with OGTT > 7.8 mmol l-1 or with family history of T2D
0	allergy	AGTR2	NA	METHODS	This variant is located in an intergenic region, flanked by AGTR2 and SLC6A14 genes, and within several DNase I hypersensitive sites.
0	NA	NA	rs146662075	METHODS	We searched for regulatory marks (i.e., H3K4me1 and H3K27ac marks) through the HaploReg web server (http://archive.broadinstitute.org/mammals/haploreg/haploreg.php), in order to assess which type of regulatory element was associated with the rs146662075 variant
0	NA	NA	rs146662075	METHODS	To further evaluate the putative regulatory role of rs146662075, we used the WashU EpiGenome Browser (http://epigenomegateway.wustl.edu/browser/, last access on June 2016).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We used the following public data hubs: (1) the reference human epigenomes from the Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium track hubs and (2) the Roadmap Epigenomics Integrative Analysis Hub.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	These data were released by the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Mapping Consortium.
0	NA	AGTR2	rs146662075	METHODS	RNA-seq data were used to evaluate whether gene expression of any of the closest genes (AGTR2 and SLC6A14 genes, fixed scale at 80 RPKM) correlated with the presence of the H3K27ac enhancer marks (a more strict mark for active enhancers in contrast with H3K4me1, which were highlighted by the HaploReg search) at the rs146662075 location.
0	NA	NA	rs146662075	METHODS	For visualizing the H3K27ac marks around rs146662075, we focused on a region of 8 kb and we used a fixed scale at 40 -log10 Poisson p-value of the counts relative to the expected background count (lambdalocal)
0	NA	NA	rs146662075	METHODS	The NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium data from standardized epigenomes also allowed us to further interrogate which target gene within the same topologically associating domain (TAD) was more likely to be regulated by this rs146662075 enhancer.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We used H3K27ac narrow peaks from 59 tissues called using MACSv2 with a p-value threshold of 0.01 from 98 consolidated epigenomes to seek for enhancer marks in a given tissue (the presence of H3K27ac peak).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	To assess gene expression for any of the putative target genes within TAD, we used the RPKM expression matrix for 57 consolidated epigenomes (http://egg2.wustl.edu/roadmap/data/byDataType/rna/) and gene expression quantifications for fetal muscle leg, fetal muscle trunk, and fetal stomach provided by ENCODE (https://www.encodeproject.org/).
