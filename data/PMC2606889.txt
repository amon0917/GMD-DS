0	insulin-treated diabetes	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	OBJECTIVE:Two recent genome-wide association (GWA) studies have revealed novel loci for type 1 diabetes, a common multifactorial disease with a strong genetic component.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	To fully utilize the GWA data that we had obtained by genotyping 563 type 1 diabetes probands and 1,146 control subjects, as well as 483 case subject-parent trios, using the Illumina HumanHap550 BeadChip, we designed a full stage 2 study to capture other possible association signals
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS:From our existing datasets, we selected 982 markers with P < 0.05 in both GWA cohorts.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Genotyping these in an independent set of 636 nuclear families with 974 affected offspring revealed 75 markers that also had P < 0.05 in this third cohort.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Among these, six single nucleotide polymorphisms in five novel loci also had P < 0.05 in the Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium dataset and were further tested in 1,303 type 1 diabetes probands from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (DCCT/EDIC) plus 1,673 control subjects
1	NA	UBASH3A	rs9976767	ABSTRACT	RESULTS:Two markers (rs9976767 and rs3757247) remained significant after adjusting for the number of tests in this last cohort; they reside in UBASH3A (OR 1.16; combined P = 2.33 x 10-8) and BACH2 (1.13; combined P = 1.25 x 10-6)
0	insulin-treated diabetes	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	CONCLUSIONS:Evaluation of a large number of statistical GWA candidates in several independent cohorts has revealed additional loci that are associated with type 1 diabetes.
1	NA	UBASH3A	NA	ABSTRACT	The two genes at these respective loci, UBASH3A and BACH2, are both biologically relevant to autoimmunity
0	insulin-treated diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	Type 1 diabetes is a multifactorial disease with a strong genetic component that results from autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic beta-cells.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	The major type 1 diabetes susceptibility locus, mapping to the HLA class II genes at 6p21 and encoding highly polymorphic antigen-presenting proteins, accounts for almost 50% of the genetic risk for type 1 diabetes.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Several other loci with more modest effects are known, but they do not account for the remaining portion of the risk
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	The recent development of high-throughput single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping array technologies has enabled us and others to perform high-density genome-wide association (GWA) studies in search of the remaining type 1 diabetes loci.
0	insulin-treated diabetes	KIAA0350	NA	INTRO	We recently reported the outcome of our GWA for type 1 diabetes in a large pediatric type 1 diabetic cohort of European descent; in addition to confirming previously identified loci, we observed highly significant and replicated association with KIAA0350 (now renamed CLEC16A [C-type lectin domain family 16 member A]).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Subsequent follow-up of our data also revealed a locus on 12q13.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In parallel and independently, the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) also demonstrated replicated association to the same linkage disequlibrium blocks at 16p13 and 12q13, along with two additional loci on 12q24 and 18p11
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The results that we have reported thus far were of loci that achieved statistical significance on the basis of the results of the GWA genotyping (stage 1) or replication in additional cohorts (stage 2) of only a small number of the most promising loci.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Here, we describe the results of a full evaluation of all statistical candidates from the GWA phase

0	diabetes	NA	NA	RESULTS	Using our GWA data from 563 Caucasian type 1 diabetes probands and 1,146 control subjects plus 483 type 1 diabetes case-parent trios using the Illumina HumanHap550 BeadChip, we identified 982 SNPs outside the major histocompatibility complex region that were suggestive of a potential type 1 diabetes association in the same direction in both cohorts (P < 0.05).
0	diabetes	NA	NA	RESULTS	We then genotyped these SNPs using the Illumina GoldenGate platform in an independent cohort of 636 nuclear type 1 diabetic families from Canada and the Type 1 Diabetes Genetics Consortium.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	With the completion of genotyping the third cohort, the WTCCC summary data became available (http://www.wtccc.org.uk).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Consequently, we selected markers that met the P < 0.05 threshold both in this third cohort and in the WTCCC dataset.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Imputation from the Affymetrix data of the WTCCC set was near perfect in all cases (supplementary Table 1).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	As shown in Table 2, 33 markers met the P < 0.05 threshold across all four cohorts.
0	NA	PTPN22	NA	RESULTS	Although the bulk of them mapped to known loci (PTPN22, 12q13, KIAA0350, IL2RA, CTLA4, and IFIH1), six SNPs in five loci were completely novel.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	RESULTS	These were tested in an additional case-control cohort consisting of 1,303 type 1 diabetes probands from the DCCT/EDIC study and an independent dataset of 1,673 control subjects from Philadelphia who had been genotyped on the Illumina 1M and HumanHap550K BeadChips, respectively
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Two signals replicated in this fifth independent cohort (Table 3), and the P values were significant after correction for testing six markers (five independent loci).
1	NA	UBASH3A	NA	RESULTS	They map to UBASH3A (ubiquitin-associated and SH3 domain-containing protein A) and BACH2 (broad complex-tramtrack-bric-a-brac [BTB] and cap 'n' collar [CNC] homology 2).

0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Taken together, our full second-stage approach and combined meta-analysis have revealed additional loci associated with type 1 diabetes.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Clearly the risks are relatively modest compared with previously described associations, and it was only with this sample size at our disposal that we could we detect and establish these signals as true positives through an independent validation effort
0	NA	UBASH3A	NA	DISCUSS	UBASH3A is the only gene in its corresponding region of linkage disequilibrium.
0	NA	Sts2	NA	DISCUSS	Mice lacking Sts2 (the mouse homologue for UBASH3A) have been shown to be normal in all respects, including T-cell function.
0	NA	Sts1	NA	DISCUSS	Mice lacking both Sts1 and Sts2 do have increased splenocyte numbers and are hyper-responsive to T-cell receptor stimulation.
0	NA	STS1	NA	DISCUSS	It has been suggested that STS1 and STS2 are critical regulators of the signaling pathways that control T-cell activation
1	NA	BACH2	NA	DISCUSS	BACH2 is also the only gene at its corresponding region of linkage disequilibrium.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The gene product is a member of the small Maf family, which consists of basic region leucine zipper proteins that function either as transcriptional activators or repressors depending on the proteins with which they heterodimerize.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Muto et al.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	found that Bach2-/- mice had relatively high levels of serum IgM but low levels of IgA and IgG subclasses.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The Bach2-/- mice have also been reported to present with deficient T-cell-independent and T-cell-dependent IgG responses, leading the authors to conclude that BACH2 was a regulator of the antibody response
1	diabetes	NA	rs1983853	DISCUSS	It should also be noted that rs1983853 yielded a nominally significant association with type 1 diabetes in all of the cohorts but did not survive correction for multiple testing in the final validation attempt in the Toronto dataset.
1	NA	EDG7	NA	DISCUSS	This SNP resides in endothelial differentiation gene 7 (EDG7; formerly LPA3), which has been implicated in mechanisms of embryo implantation.
1	NA	GLIS3	NA	DISCUSS	The SNPs on GLIS3 and RASGRP1 were not validated.
0	insulin-treated diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	They may have been false positives in the earlier stages; alternatively, lack of replication in DCCT/EDIC may be due to different and/or weaker genetic risk determinants in this cohort with late age of onset of type 1 diabetes.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This question must be addressed in future studies.
1	pancreatic	GLIS3	NA	DISCUSS	The GLI-similar 3 (GLIS3) gene plays important roles in the development of pancreatic beta-cells.

1	autoimmunity of systemic lupus erythematosus	RASGRP1	NA	DISCUSS	The RAS guanyl releasing protein 1 (RASGRP1) gene has important roles in immune regulation, and it has been suggested that it contributes to the autoimmunity of systemic lupus erythematosus
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In addition to our findings, what we failed to find deserves comment.
0	NA	C12orf30	rs17696736	DISCUSS	In addition to the findings described above, our study confirmed another interesting locus, rs17696736 (C12orf30) at 12q24, reported in the WTCCC study.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our GWA family cohort suggested type 1 diabetes association with P = 0.011; however, limited by the sample size, our GWA case-control cohort did not show statistical significance (P > 0.05).
0	diabetes	NA	rs17696736	DISCUSS	To validate the type 1 diabetes association, we genotyped rs17696736 using the Sequenom iPLEX assay (Sequenom, Cambridge, MA) in the 1,120 Canadian families and the 549 Type 1 Diabetes Genetics Consortium families.
0	error and experimental error	NA	rs17696736	DISCUSS	The call rate of rs17696736 genotyping was 99.8%, and no Mendelian error was found.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	With the family-based association test, we confirmed the type 1 diabetes association with P = 8.00 x 10-7, minor G allele frequency 0.452, and OR 1.276.
0	NA	PTPN22	NA	DISCUSS	However, given the very thorough coverage of European genetic variation by the Hap550 and the power of our aggregate sample size, it is very unlikely that we missed more than a very small number of common variants with an effect size approaching that of the INS (minor allele frequency 0.2 and OR 0.5; each of our three discovery cohorts has >99.9% power to detect it at alpha = 0.05 level) or PTPN22 (minor allele frequency 0.1 and OR 1.8; each of our three discovery cohorts has >99.0% power to detect it at alpha = 0.05 level) loci
0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Undoubtedly, larger sample sizes and meta-analysis of all available GWA data will discover an increasing number of loci with decreasing effect sizes, which are unlikely to explain the remaining familial clustering of type 1 diabetes.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Such explanation should be sought, it appears, in rare variants, the detection of which is now coming within reach with the use of high-throughput methods for sequencing and for detecting structural variation
