0	AMD	NA	NA	INTRO	Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common retinal disease of public health importance and is the most common cause of blindness in older adults in developed countries.
0	AMD	NA	NA	INTRO	AMD, as a complex disorder, is characterized by genetic and nongenetic factors.
0	AMD	NA	NA	INTRO	Currently, 34 genetic loci containing 52 independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with advanced AMD risk.
0	AMD	NA	NA	INTRO	However, these associations do not comprise all the genetic risks for advanced AMD.
0	AMD	NA	NA	INTRO	In addition to genetic factors from the nuclear genome, mitochondrial (mt) SNPs also are associated with AMD risk.
0	AMD	NA	NA	INTRO	A number of studies relate mtDNA variation to AMD through haplogroup classification, which is based on a set of defining mtSNPs and traces maternal lineages of different human populations.
0	AMD	NA	NA	INTRO	The mt haplogroups J, U, and T have been associated reproducibly with increased risk of AMD, whereas haplogroup H has been associated negatively with AMD risk in populations of European ancestry.
0	AMD	NA	NA	INTRO	A natural follow-up to these studies was to examine whether mitochondrial variation influenced risk of AMD by itself, or through interactions with other nuclear-encoded risk factors associated with AMD
0	AMD	NA	NA	INTRO	Mitochondrial genetic variation may influence AMD risk by modulating expression of nuclear-encoded genes or vice-versa.
0	NA	CFH	NA	INTRO	Expression of known genetic risk factors, such as CFH and C3, in cybrid RPE cell lines differs by mt haplogroup.
0	AMD	TIMP3	NA	INTRO	Nuclear-encoded genes involved in drusen makeup, reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulation, and responses to oxidative stress (all processes that characterize AMD or engage in the manifestation of AMD) demonstrated significant changes in gene expression in response to mtDNA damage, including two genes (TIMP3, downregulated, and VEGFA, upregulated) that contain variants associated with AMD risk.
0	AMD	NA	NA	INTRO	These studies suggest that consideration of interactions between genetic variations in the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes might reveal novel genetic risk factors for AMD
0	AMD	NA	NA	INTRO	Consequently, this study included mtSNP x nuclear SNP (nSNP) statistical interactions in a genome-wide search for novel AMD risk factors.
0	AMD	NA	NA	INTRO	Our genome-wide interaction study (GWIS) of the large, phenotypically well characterized International AMD Genomics Consortium (IAMDGC) dataset  considered mtSNP x nSNP statistical interactions on AMD risk with the objective of identifying novel genetic loci associated with advanced AMD risk
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	A total of 33,976 participants (14,352 males and 19,624 females) of European ancestry from the IAMDGC primary dataset were included in the GWIS analyses.
0	atrophy	NA	NA	METHODS	As described previously, individuals were evaluated clinically across 26 sites by fundus photography, with the exception of one site, and characterized by the presence of drusen, geographic atrophy (GA), and choroidal neovascularization (CNV); a number of sites (18 of the 26 sites) discerned between the advanced AMD subtypes through optical coherence tomography (OCT) or fluorescein angiography.
0	AMD	NA	NA	METHODS	"The resulting dataset contained 17,832 controls (category ""No AMD""; mean age 70.7 years, 56% female) and 16,144 advanced AMD cases (categories ""GA Only,"" n = 3,235; ""CNV Only,"" n = 10,749; and ""Mixed GA/CNV,"" n = 2,160); mean age, 76.8 years; 60% female; and at least 50 years old at the time of diagnosis)."
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	For protection of human subjects regarding data procurement, each site upheld the tenets outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	These phenotype data and the genetic data amassed by the IAMDGC have been added to the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) with accession code phs001039.v1.p1
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	All individuals were genotyped at the Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR) with a custom-made Illumina HumanCoreExome genotyping array featuring, after quality control, 521,950 total variants (in which the total number of genotyped variants, excluding monomorphic variants, across all autosomal chromosomes was 434,054).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Genotyping quality control criteria called for variants with less than 98.5% call rates and those with significant departures from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P < 10-6) in controls to be dropped.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Samples with <98.5% call rates were removed from analysis.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	MINIMAC and the 1000 Genomes Project Phase I reference population genotypes (version 3, SHAPEIT2 Reference) were used for imputation against the framework SNPs in the HumanCoreExome panel.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	A total of 27,602,838 nSNPs were imputed before imputation quality control, described in the following sections
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	In the GWIS, joint effects with four mtSNPs (A4917G, T5004C, G12771A, and C16069T) were evaluated.
0	AMD	NA	NA	METHODS	The mtSNPs were selected, as described in more detail below, based on prior published associations with AMD risk or nominally statistically significant genetic main effects in the IAMDGC dataset.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	An additional criterion, mtSNP rare allele frequency overall of at least 0.005 (0.5%), was imposed for sufficient statistical power, given consideration with a common nuclear variant, to detect moderate to strong interaction effects.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Some mtSNPs associated in prior studies (including several haplogroup-defining SNPs) were not available on the HumanCoreExome array.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	All four mtSNPs were statistically independent (data not shown)
0	AMD	NA	NA	METHODS	Association of mtSNPs and advanced AMD was evaluated using logistic regression models implemented in the PLINK software package (version 1.07), adjusting for whole genome amplification (yes/no), which may introduce bias from generation of DNA product in specific nucleotide-rich or -poor regions, and population structure (first two variables from principal components analysis).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	mtSNP names reflect the base change and position based on the revised Cambridge reference sequence (rCRS).
0	AMD	NA	T5004C	METHODS	For the 265 available genotyped mt variants (of which nine were monomorphic), association between the advanced AMD phenotype and mt variants (or genotype) was nominally statistically significant for mtSNPs T5004C (minor allele frequency [MAF] = 0.017, P = 0.03, odds ratio [OR] = 0.83, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.70-0.99) and G12771A (MAF = 0.0054, P = 0.0008, OR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.25-2.30).
0	AMD	NA	NA	METHODS	mtSNP A4917G was not associated significantly with advanced AMD risk (MAF = 0.10, P = 0.41, OR = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.96-1.10) in the current dataset, but was included in the GWIS based on its prior association with AMD risk in the study of Canter et al.
0	AMD	NA	C16069T	METHODS	The fourth mtSNP, C16069T (MAF = 0.0985, P = 0.15, OR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.88-1.02) was not statistically significant in this dataset but was associated previously with advanced AMD in a set of 200 CNV patients and 385 controls (P < 0.05, OR = 1.74, 95% CI = 1.0-2.9).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Due to missing mt genotypes, each GWIS sample size was slightly different from the total: 16,122 cases and 17,810 controls for mtSNP A4917G; 15,407 cases and 16,350 controls for mtSNP T5004C; 15,413 cases and 16,351 controls for G12771A; and 16,042 cases and 17,734 controls for C16069T
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	To reduce computational time, the dataset of 27,602,838 imputed and genotyped nSNPs was pruned by eliminating SNPs that were correlated strongly with nearby SNPs.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	PLINK was used to determine the linkage disequilibrium (LD) values (r2) between each pair of variants in a window of 100 variants; LD was calculated using a 5-variant sliding window.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	If a variant pair's r2 value was greater than 0.8, one of the two SNPs was eliminated randomly.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	This LD level was chosen to ensure that nSNPs in strong LD were removed while permitting retention of nSNPs that were representative of the genomic regions across all autosomal chromosomes.
0	NA	CAF	NA	METHODS	After LD pruning, the total number of variants remaining was 11,697,015, and those variants with imputation quality scores (represented by R2 values) were retained for analysis according to previously established criteria: (1) common variants - MAF in controls (CAF) >= 0.01 and R2 > 0.30 and (2) rare variants - CAF < 0.01 and R2 > 0.80
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Consequently, the final total number of filtered nSNPs considered in each genome-wide interaction analysis was 3,866,946 variants (of which 57,862 were genotyped)
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Kraft's two degree of freedom (2df) joint test of genetic main effects and gene-environment interaction compares two logistic regression models: (1) a full model containing the mtSNP and nSNP main effects, a mtSNP x nSNP interaction term, and (2) a partial model lacking the nSNP main effect and the mtSNP x nSNP interaction term.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Both models were adjusted for population stratification (two principal components) and whole genome amplification (WGA) status.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Sensitivity analyses evaluated the effect of WGA status in models rerun for significant novel loci (see Discussion).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	In addition, selection of covariates for inclusion in regression models, particularly in assessing effects of sex and age (such as differences in applying a minimum age requirement for controls versus unspecified age restriction concerning controls), was decided based on sensitivity analyses that were used in primary analyses by the IAMDGC.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	A joint test statistic was created by taking the difference of the -2 log likelihoods for the two models; this statistic follows a 2df chi2 distribution.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	A significant joint test statistic signals one of three possible scenarios: a strong nSNP genetic main effect, a strong mtSNP x nSNP interaction effect, or a combination of both.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The traditional GWAS significance threshold of P < 5 x 10-8 was used to identify statistically significant joint effects, and genome-wide significant loci were filtered further by nominal evidence of gene-gene interaction (interaction term P < 0.01).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Regression models were constructed using the R programming language (version 3.0.1).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The 2df joint test P value and test statistic were calculated with the lrtest function from the R package epicalc (version 2.15.1.0)
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	For each GWIS, the genomic inflation factor lambdagc was expressed as the quotient of the median 2df observed and median 2df expected chi2 test statistics (with the latter value equal to 1.386).
0	AMD	NA	NA	METHODS	Only genotyped and imputed nuclear variants meeting quality control criteria and falling beyond the genomic boundaries of the 34 known AMD risk associated regions were included in calculations.
0	AMD	NA	NA	METHODS	By omitting variants in the 34 known AMD risk loci, this evaluates whether there still is notable deviation from the null hypothesis of the overwhelming majority of tested genetic loci being unassociated with advanced AMD; such deviation, if present, would imply systematic bias.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Genomic boundaries for all 34 known risk loci are detailed in Supplementary Table S5 from the study of Fritsche et al
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Variants that met the statistical significance thresholds for joint effects and interaction effects were included in conditional analyses.
0	AMD	NA	NA	METHODS	"This step identified nSNPs with significant joint effects that are ""shadow effects"" of known AMD risk loci and are not independently associated with AMD risk."
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	To account for potential effect modification by mtSNP, conditional analyses were performed stratified by mtSNP allele.
0	AMD	NA	NA	METHODS	Therefore, in each group (reference allele carriers versus alternate allele carriers), the logistic regression model contains nSNP allele dosage, known AMD risk variant allele dosage, and covariates for population stratification and whole genome amplification.
0	AMD	NA	NA	METHODS	At each AMD locus, the known AMD risk variants were selected from the list of the 52 independently associated risk variants identified by IAMDGC (see Supplementary Table S4 from the study of Fritsche et al.)

1	AMD	NA	G12771A	METHODS	For the ABDH2/RLBP1 nSNPs and mtSNP G12771A, calculated power at alpha = 5 x 10-8 for the 2df joint test was contrasted with calculated power for the 1df interaction test and ABHD2/RLPB1 nSNP genetic main effects on advanced AMD risk.
1	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	For 15,413 cases and 16,351 controls, the mtSNP allele frequency selected was 0.0054 (equivalent to 12771A frequency) while the nSNP ABHD2/RLBP1 allele frequency chosen was 0.50.

0	AMD	LIPC	NA	RESULTS	Conditional analyses in both groups (LIPC variants identified by IAMDGC and the TRPM1 variants from nSNP x mtA4917G interaction analyses) did not eliminate the significant signal at these nSNPs associated with AMD risk (from analyses for 12771A carriers, P values from 0.0028 to 0.0048; from analyses for 12771G carriers, P values from 4.5 x 10-7 to 1.6 x 10-6; see Table 3 and Supplementary Table S4, which present P values in each subset regarding regression models without the known AMD risk variants in LIPC and associated TRPM1 variants from nSNP x mtA4917G interaction analyses, for comparison to the range of values listed here)

0	AMD	NA	NA	RESULTS	Both novel AMD loci on chromosome 15 are annotated as having possibly regulatory potential, indicating one mechanism by which these variants might influence development of AMD through altered gene expression.
1	NA	TRPM1	NA	RESULTS	The UCSC Genome Browser was used to assess potential functional consequences of the two intronic TRPM1 SNPs and one intronic ABHD2 SNP, by examining annotations from the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Project.
1	allergy	NA	rs6493454	RESULTS	DNase I hypersensitivity sites (DHSs) overlap the genomic positions of peak markers rs6493454 (DHS coordinate range, 31393926-31394115) and rs7182946 (DHS coordinate range, 31394766-31395235), suggesting these regions may impact gene expression.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Notably, the strongest DNase I signal peak at each site was obtained in the human RPE cell line, or cell type HRPEpiC (Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	S9).
1	NA	ABHD2	rs4932478	RESULTS	In the other locus, the ABHD2 SNP rs4932478 overlaps two transcription factor binding sites (RELA and RUNX3), which primarily influence expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines
0	AMD	NA	NA	RESULTS	To allow for the possibility that the relevant functional SNP in each locus is in linkage disequilibrium with the nSNPs most strongly associated with AMD, we used HaploReg, version 4 to evaluate regulatory potential of other SNPs in moderate-to-strong LD at the loci.
1	NA	TRPM1	NA	RESULTS	Proximal variants in strong LD (r2 >= 0.80) with the two TRPM1 nSNPs, are all annotated as intronic while variants in moderate to strong LD (r2 >= 0.40) with the eight ABHD2/RLBP1 nSNPs, were intronic or in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR).
0	NA	TRPM1	rs3809579	RESULTS	Of the four variants in strong LD with the two TRPM1 SNPs, three were in promoter and enhancer histone marks, three overlapped DHSs in at least 1 tissue (maximum 5 tissues), and one (rs3809579) was located in 2 transcription factor binding sites, GATA2 and USF1 (Supplementary Fig.

1	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Variants in LD with the ABHD2/RLBP1 nSNPs had annotations ranging from enhancer histone marks, DHSs, and corresponding transcription factors (such as GATA2, EBF1, and NFKB).
0	AMD	NA	NA	RESULTS	In short, functional annotation of variants in these two loci are consistent with regulatory effects, suggesting that gene expression may differ by mtSNP genotype, influencing risk of AMD
1	AMD	TRPM1	NA	DISCUSS	Across the four GWIS, known AMD genetic factors were detected (as expected) and two novel AMD genetic risk factors, TRPM1 and ABHD2/RLBP1, were identified.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	A minority of the 34 known risk loci did not reach genome-wide significance for mtSNP T5004C-nSNP interaction and mtSNP G12771A-nSNP interaction analyses, possibly due to lower power of the 2df test to detect loci driven by main effects alone.
1	AMD	TRPM1	NA	DISCUSS	At the two novel loci, TRPM1 and ABHD2/RLBP1, when restricting AMD cases to CNV only or GA only, the effect sizes were similar to those measures for the combined advanced AMD subtypes described in the Methods section (data not shown).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Sensitivity analyses excluding subjects whose DNA source was from WGA did not change the effect sizes at these loci (data not shown).
0	AMD	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The large case-control data set with genome-wide genotyping from a single genotyping center provided substantial power to detect novel loci for advanced AMD by considering gene x gene interactions that might have obscured main effects in the original GWAS.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Post hoc power calculations determined that the joint test in this dataset had 70% to 74% power at alpha = 5 x 10-8 to detect the two novel loci reported here, greater than power to detect main effects at these two loci (45%-49%) and the pairwise interactions (1%-2%).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This increase in statistical power from using the 2df joint test may have allowed the detection of novel loci previously missed in the IAMDGC primary analyses.
1	NA	NA	G12771A	DISCUSS	As testament to the project's large scale and ability to examine interactions involving rare alleles, joint effects of rare mtSNP G12771A (only 173 of the 31,764 genotyped individuals carry 12771A) and common ABHD2/RLBP1 SNPs were genome-wide statistically significant and met the interaction term significance threshold
1	NA	TRPM1	NA	DISCUSS	Both novel loci, TRPM1 and ABHD2/RLBP1, have functional connections to the visual system.
0	autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness	TRPM1	NA	DISCUSS	Mutations in TRPM1 have been shown to cause autosomal recessive congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB) and to alter melanocyte function or melanin synthesis.
0	AMD	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In advanced AMD, photoreceptor death (particularly of rods, which are crucial in black and white vision) may produce night vision difficulties.
0	AMD	NA	NA	DISCUSS	According to the Complications of AMD Prevention Trial (CAPT) study involving 1052 subjects with multiple large drusen, positive association between night vision symptoms, as recorded from responses on a night vision questionnaire, and risk of GA or CNV was nominally statistically significant (CNV observed eyes [total = 1043], first quartile [worst night vision] versus fourth quartile [best night vision] - P = 0.01, relative risk (RR) = 1.92, 95% CI = 1.08-3.44; GA observed eyes [total = 988], first quartile versus fourth quartile - P = 0.001, RR = 4.60, 95% CI = 1.81-11.6).
1	atherosclerotic	ABHD2	NA	DISCUSS	ABHD2's function is not well characterized and may possibly include immunological roles; for example, high ABHD2 expression was detected in macrophages situated in atherosclerotic lesions.
1	AMD	RLBP1	NA	DISCUSS	In contrast, RLBP1 encodes a protein with a niche in the visual cycle, and variants in this gene have been associated with other retinal pathologies distinct from AMD, such as Newfoundland rod-cone dystrophy and retinitis punctata albescens.
0	retinitis punctata albescens	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Retinitis punctata albescens (OMIM: 136880) may be traced in families as following autosomal recessive patterns of inheritance; this clinical phenotype is distinct from AMD in that white specks in the eye are detected in patients' fundus photography, but drusen are not noted features.
0	retinitis punctata albescens	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In contrast to retinitis punctata albescens and in stark contrast to AMD, vision deterioration is swifter for sufferers of Newfoundland rod-cone dystrophy (OMIM: 607476); in fact, onset occurs before adolescence as observed by Eichers et al., who also recorded patients' vision loss experiences occurring as a young adult or upon reaching middle-age.
1	NA	MT-ND2	NA	DISCUSS	The mtSNPs that interact with these two loci, A4917G and G12771A, are in genes that encode NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I) subunits; A4917G is in MT-ND2, which encodes subunit 2, and G12771A is in MT-ND5, which encodes subunit 5.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Complex I is a component of the electron transport chain, which participates in ATP production during oxidative phosphorylation.
0	AMD	NA	NA	DISCUSS	While mtSNP A4917G has been associated previously with AMD, G12771A has not been associated with AMD
1	multifactorial disease	MT-ND5	NA	DISCUSS	The mtSNPs A4917G and G12771A have not been implicated directly in mt damage or dysfunction; however, the following functional studies may offer biological connections between MT-ND5, the gene containing G12771A, and mt dysfunction in the context of AMD.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In an investigation by Terluk et al.
1	AMD	MT-ND5	G12771A	DISCUSS	of 51 donor eyes (30 controls and 21 AMD cases or eyes with intermediate AMD pathology), a significant rise in RPE mtDNA damage in several regions of the mt genome in the macula was discovered; among the mt genomic regions found to have such a significant change in mtDNA damage when comparing cases to controls was MT-ND5 (P value = 0.03) where G12771A resides.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Miceli and Jazwinski, comparing mtDNA-devoid ARPE-19 cells with mtDNA-containing ARPE-19 cells, recorded a lower mt membrane potential for those cells without mtDNA.
0	AMD	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Thus, mtDNA dysfunction, a characteristic of AMD pathology or physiology, may be accompanied by effects on membrane potential; as an illustration of a contributor to mt/mtDNA damage in RPE cells, oxidative stress emerging from exposure to peroxides can affect cytosolic and intracellular calcium (Ca2+) levels.
1	NA	MT-ND5	NA	DISCUSS	Also, the fact that MT-ND5, a gene encoding a Complex I subunit, was one of the mt genomic regions to have a significant escalation in mtDNA damage suggests that vital AMD-defining processes impact bioenergetics.
0	AMD	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Such changes might alter the effect of nSNPs on risk of AMD, as suggested by the results of the current study
1	AMD	TRPM1	rs6493454	DISCUSS	The inverse association of TRPM1 intronic variants rs6493454 and rs7182946 and advanced AMD was restricted to the carriers of the common 4917A allele.
0	AMD	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The 4917G allele defines mt haplogroup T and was associated previously with increased risk of AMD.
0	NA	TRPM1	NA	DISCUSS	This pattern suggests heterogeneity of effects, where the inverse association of the minor alleles at TRPM1 SNPs is present only in individuals who lack the risk allele G at mt4917
0	AMD	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Although mtSNP A4917G in the IAMDGC dataset was not associated with (advanced) AMD risk, a finding supported by Tilleul et al.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	but one in contrast with previous reports of positive association, our results suggested a possible explanation for the mtSNP's nonsignificant main effects: varying degrees of interaction with alleles in the nuclear genome.
0	AMD	TRPM1	NA	DISCUSS	As described in the stratified analyses on TRPM1 genotype (see Results), an association (positive) with AMD risk was present only in TRPM1 nSNP minor allele carriers.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	These results suggested that the interaction between mtSNP and nSNP genotype influences the detection of main effects at both loci and may explain the inconsistent results at mtSNP A4917G
1	AMD	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The patterns of association between variants in the ABHD2/RLBP1 region and advanced AMD were indicative of synergy between mtSNP and nSNP alleles.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Associations with nSNPs in this region were stronger in the smaller subset carrying the 12771A allele ([minimum OR = 2.11] than the larger group carrying 12771G [minimum OR = 1.08]).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The ORs for nSNPs in the mtSNP 12771A carrier group are greater than the OR for a combination of both carrier groups (reflected from main nSNP genetic effects where OR = 1.09).
1	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This suggests a potential synergistic interaction between the ABHD2/RLBP1 SNPs and mtSNP G12771A
0	AMD	NA	NA	DISCUSS	These two loci contain plausible candidate genes for AMD, based on their biological functions and prior association with other disorders of the visual system.
0	NA	TRPM1	NA	DISCUSS	The ion channel TRPM1 is expressed in the retina, specifically in depolarizing bipolar cells.
0	blindness	metabotropic glutamate receptor 6	NA	DISCUSS	The channel is a member of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 6 signaling pathway, a vision-related pathway in which interference with any signal transduction members may lead to blindness.
0	NA	TRPM1	NA	DISCUSS	Other studies have shown that TRPM1 regulates Ca2+ levels in melanocytes; molecular experiments demonstrate that disturbed TRPM1 expression incites a drop in intracellular Ca2+ concentration levels.
1	NA	TRPM1	NA	DISCUSS	Of factors common to regulatory mechanisms relevant to TRPM1 and RLBP1, expression of both genes is proposed to be controlled by microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), which may shape RPE and neural-crest derived melanocyte development, as supported by in vitro (ARPE-19 cell lines) and in vivo (mouse models) experiments.
0	AMD	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The consideration of gene x gene interaction in statistical models used by this study allowed the detection of two new loci for AMD.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, caution is needed in the interpretation of these results; statistical interactions are not necessarily indicative of physical, such as protein x protein, interactions in biological systems.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	As discussed earlier, the patterns of interaction detected may reflect genetic heterogeneity (in which effects of one locus are found in individuals lacking the risk allele at a second locus) or modest synergy (which may or may not imply biological interaction).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The determination of the nature of such synergistic interactions depends on future functional genomic studies.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Replication efforts should include examination of other racial and ethnic backgrounds, as the current study was limited to individuals of European ancestry
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This study demonstrated that considering interactions between the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes successfully identifies genetic risk factors not detected by GWAS studies that were focused on main effects of nuclear variation.
0	AMD	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The novel loci further the understanding of AMD pathophysiology and suggests potential synergy between mitochondrial and nuclear genetic variation in modulating risk of advanced AMD
