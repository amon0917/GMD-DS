0	pancreatic cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Pancreatic cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer death with an estimated death of 24,634 patients in Japan in year 2007.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Its 5-year survival rate is as low as 6.7% (http://www.fpcr.or.jp/publication/pdf/statistics2009/fig01.pdf and http://www.fpcr.or.jp/publication/pdf/statistics2009/fig20.pdf).
0	pancreatic cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Since no specific symptom is observed in the patients with pancreatic cancer at an early stage, most of the patients were diagnosed at their advanced stage with a very low possibility of cure for the disease
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Previous reports indicated the involvement of both environmental and genetics factors in the etiology of this deleterious disease.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	Several case-control and cohort epidemiological studies have identified a number of possible risk factors such as smoking, diabetes, chronic pancreatitis, which are likely to predispose individual to the disease.
0	familial aggregation of the disease	NA	NA	INTRO	In addition, familial aggregation of the disease has implied the possible involvement of genetic factors in pancreatic cancer; approximately 10% of the patients were reported to have family history and individuals having first-degree relatives with pancreatic cancer revealed 2- to 4- fold higher risk of the disease.
0	pancreatic cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	These data indicated that genetic factors are likely to play some roles in the development of pancreatic cancer.
0	pancreatic cancer	CDKN2A	NA	INTRO	In the last decade, the advancement of molecular biology improved the understanding of the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer and characterized a number of genes that mutated in pancreatic cancers, such as somatic mutations in genes INK4A(CDKN2A), TP53, DPC4, BRCA1/2, STK11, APC, KRAS and ATM and PALB2 are found in pancreatic cancers

0	pancreatic cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Here we present results of GWAS analysis on 991 cases with pancreatic cancer and 5209 controls.
0	pancreatic cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our study represents the first GWAS attempt to identify common variants associated with pancreatic cancer in Japanese population and successfully identified SNPs located on chromosomal loci of 6p25.3, 12p11.21 and 7q36.2 are significantly associated with increased risk of pancreatic cancer in Japanese population
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	It is known that the development of the common disease is caused by the accumulation of common genetic variants, and each of this variant has a very modest effect on the risk (for example OR of <1.2).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In order to detect such small fraction, GWAS involving much larger populations (5000-10000) should be required.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our study was expected to identify SNPs with moderate effects (i.e OR>1.4).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Hence SNPs that show very modest effect might have failed to be identified through this study
1	NA	FOXQ1	rs9502893	DISCUSS	The most significantly associated SNP in this GWAS, rs9502893 (P-value = 3.30x10-7, OR = 1.29) is located within a 75 kb LD block which encompasses gene FOXQ1 on chromosome loci 6p25.3.
1	NA	FOXQ1	NA	DISCUSS	FOXQ1 encodes for protein forkhead box (Fox) Q1.
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The Fox family of transcription factors consists of at least 43 members and mutations in Fox genes can cause significant effects on human common disease and cancers.
0	pancreatic cancer	FoxM1	NA	DISCUSS	A Fox member, FoxM1, is well-known to be associated with oncogenesis of pancreatic cancer.
0	pancreatic cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Down-regulation of this protein results in the inhibition of migration, invasion and angiogenesis in pancreatic cancer cells.
1	pancreatic cancer	FOXQ1	NA	DISCUSS	Furthermore, a recent study showed that FoxQ1 is overexpressed in pancreatic cancer, suggesting its role in pancreatic cancer tumorigenesis.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Although the SNP that we identified is approximately 25 kb downstream to this gene, the associated SNP may 'tag' the causative variant located on the expression regulatory region of the gene and subsequently alter expression of the gene.
0	prostate carcinogenesis	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, further study is needed to elucidate a precise biological role and mechanism of the gene function with regard to pancreatic carcinogenesis
1	NA	BICD1	rs708224	DISCUSS	The second most significantly associated SNP, rs708224 (P-value = 3.30x10-7, OR = 1.32) is located within the BICD1 gene.
1	NA	BICD1	NA	DISCUSS	This gene encodes a protein Bicaudal-D homolog 1, which plays a role in vacuolar trafficking.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Previous studies reported substantial evidences indicating a link between vacuolar gene and shorter telomeres in yeast model.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In addition, Mangino et al.
1	NA	BICD1	NA	DISCUSS	suggested that genetic variations within the BICD1 gene could alter its transcriptional levels and in turn influence telomere length in humans.
0	pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Several recent studies have documented reduced telomere length in pancreatic ductal adenocarnoma specimens, suggesting telomeric dysfunction in pancreatic cancer cells.
1	pancreatic cancer	NA	rs708224	DISCUSS	Thus, it is of importance to determine the functional consequences of rs708224 and/or variations linked to this SNP in the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer
1	pancreatic cancer	DPP6	NA	DISCUSS	Several SNPs located in the first intron of DPP6 indicated suggestive associations with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer in this study.
1	NA	DPP6	NA	DISCUSS	DPP6 encodes protein dipeptidyl-peptidase 6, which binds to specific voltage-gated potassium channels and alters their expression and biophysical properties.
1	pancreatic cancer	DPP6	NA	DISCUSS	A recent study on core signaling pathways in human pancreatic cancers found three somatic mutations in DPP6 among 24 pancreatic cancer samples examined by detailed sequence analyses.
1	pancreatic cancer	DPP6	NA	DISCUSS	This report also suggested that DPP6 might play a crucial role in regulation of invasion of pancreatic cancer cells.
1	pancreatic cancer	DPP6	NA	DISCUSS	Hence, our study strengthens the risk of DPP6 in pancreatic cancer and warrants further screening on this gene to confirm its association with pancreatic cancer
0	pancreatic cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Recent GWAS reports have indicated several loci on chromosomes 9p34.2, 13q22.1, 1q32.1 and 5p15.33 to be associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer in Caucasian population.
0	NA	NA	rs9543325	DISCUSS	Among the significantly associated SNPs, rs9543325 on chromosome 13q22.1 showed moderate association in our study populations (P-value (allelic model) of 1.69x10-4; OR of 1.21 with 95%CI of 1.10-1.34) (Table S4).
0	NA	NA	rs505922	DISCUSS	On the other hand, SNPs on chromosomes 9p34.2 (rs505922) and 1q32.1 (rs3790844) showed a weak association in our study populations (P-values of 3.69x10-2 and 1.24x10-2; ORs of 1.11 and 1.14 with 95% CI of 1.01-1.22 and 1.03-1.27, respectively) (Table S4).
0	NA	Sonic Hedgehog	NA	DISCUSS	We were unable to replicate the remaining loci (SHH and two loci on chromosomes 5p15.33 and 15q14) in these reports, probably because most of these associated SNPs are either non-polymorphic or possess very low allelic frequencies (MAF = 0.01) in Japanese population.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The power of our study was not sufficient enough to detect positive associations for these variants with the low allelic frequency.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Such ethnic difference in genetic architecture of disease susceptibility is not rare.
0	diabetes	KCNQ1	NA	DISCUSS	For example, two recent GWAS reported common variants on KCNQ1 gene associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Japanese population, but European GWAS were unable to identify the associations due to the low allelic frequency of these variants in the population.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In addition, identification of susceptibility loci may be also influenced by the differences in the LD structure across different populations and by potential interaction with other genetic variants and environmental factors
0	pancreatic cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In summary, this study represents the first GWAS to identify common variants possibly associated with pancreatic cancer in Japanese population.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our study confirmed the association from the Caucasian GWAS studies and revealed several novel possible candidate associated loci that were not detected in the previous Caucasian GWAS studies.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Nevertheless, further additional replications are required to confirm or exclude the current findings
