0	hippocampal sclerosis	NA	NA	INTRO	In elderly individuals, hippocampal sclerosis of aging (HS-Aging) is a relatively common brain disease; for recent reviews, see Refs.. HS-Aging is defined by pathological manifestations: neuron loss, gliosis, and atrophy in the hippocampal formation, not deemed attributable to Alzheimer disease (AD)-type plaques and tangles.
0	cognitive defects	NA	NA	INTRO	The presence of HS-Aging pathology is associated with substantial cognitive impairment, independent of comorbid pathologies, yet this disease is generally misdiagnosed as AD in the clinical setting
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Genetic risk factors of HS-Aging are not fully characterized.
0	hippocampal sclerosis	GRN	rs5848	INTRO	Hippocampal sclerosis pathology in AD cases has been linked to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at genomic loci previously associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), namely rs5848 (GRN) and rs1990622 (near TMEM106B).
0	Alzheimer's disease	apolipoprotein E	NA	INTRO	In contrast to AD, the risk of developing HS-Aging pathology is not associated with apolipoprotein E (APOE) alleles
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	There has been no prior published genome-wide association study (GWAS) focused on HS-Aging pathology.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The endophenotype is deceptively complex and confers both potential obstacles and opportunities for a GWAS.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Challenges include the requirement for reliable autopsy data on every research subject and the advanced old age of many patients with HS-Aging.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Even archival neuropathology data must be interpreted with caution because HS-Aging has only recently been the subject of widespread attention by researchers.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	After accounting for these difficulties, there are characteristics of HS-Aging pathology that are conducive for GWAS.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Most important is the high disease prevalence which enables analyses of diverse study cohorts including population-based samples.
0	NA	TAR DNA-binding protein 43	NA	INTRO	HS-Aging pathology tends to co-occur with hippocampal TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology, an important component of the pathological endophenotype.
0	hippocampal sclerosis	TAR DNA-binding protein 43	NA	INTRO	Thus, a successful HS-Aging GWAS study would detect allele(s) associated with hippocampal sclerosis and TDP-43 pathologies across multiple cohorts of autopsied elderly individuals
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	For the current study, genomic and pathologic data from dozens of different research centers were analyzed with the goal of identifying alleles associated with risk for HS-Aging pathology.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Altogether these analyses incorporated 363 HS-Aging cases and 2,303 controls with neuropathologic evaluation.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	A two-tiered study design employed a GWAS to identify promising risk allele candidates, with subsequent evaluation of specific candidate alleles using separate cohorts.
0	NA	ATP-binding cassette, sub-family C member 9	NA	INTRO	Our main findings are (1) a polymorphism in the ATP-binding cassette, sub-family C member 9 (ABCC9) gene, also known as sulfonylurea receptor 2 (SUR2), is associated with HS-Aging pathology, and (2) exposure to sulfonylurea drugs is associated with increased risk for HS-Aging pathology among individuals who died age 85 and older
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	METHODS	The Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC) accrued genomics data from 34 different research centers (US National Institute on Aging Alzheimer's Disease Centers, or ADCs) with multiple iterations of GWAS data (References and see below), which were analyzed with neuropathological and clinical data obtained through the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC; see Reference).

0	NA	ATP-binding cassette, sub-family C member 9	NA	RESULTS	The ABCC9 gene is also known as sulfonylurea receptor 2, SUR2.
0	Type 2 diabetes	ATP-binding cassette, sub-family C member 9	NA	RESULTS	Sulfonylureas are a widely prescribed class of drugs used to treat type II diabetes mellitus; these drugs antagonize the function of the ABCC9 protein product.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We tested the hypothesis that exposure to sulfonylurea drugs is associated with altered risk for HS-Aging pathology (Table 7).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Data were obtained from NACC database with both longitudinal drug history and postmortem data from individuals dying age 85 and above with autopsies between 2010 and 2013.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	HS-Aging pathology was observed in 17.3 % (108/624) of all autopsied cases in the sample, 30.6 % of sulfonylurea users and 16.5 % of non-users.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Based on a two-tailed test and alpha = 0.05, the crude OR for autopsy-confirmed HS-Aging pathology after use of any sulfonylurea versus no sulfonylurea use was 2.23 [95 % CI: 1.06-4.68, p = 0.03; age-adjusted OR = 2.19 (95 % CI: 1.04-4.63, p = 0.04)].
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Use of any sulfonylurea was reported by 11 HS-Aging and 25 non HS-Aging subjects.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	When the analysis was restricted to the medication history given at the last assessment before death, the crude OR for use of any sulfonylurea was 2.52 [95 % CI: 1.10-5.76, p = 0.02; age-adjusted OR = 2.49 (95 % CI: 1.08-5.75, p = 0.03)].
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	There was neither positive nor negative association between sulfonylurea use and AD pathology, operationalized as AD-positive if Braak stage V or VI and AD-negative otherwise (not shown).

0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Of subjects who reported taking any anti-diabetic agent (62/624), most reported use of a sulfonylurea (36/62).
0	diabetes	NA	NA	RESULTS	The association with HS-Aging pathology was not dependent upon diabetes itself because, in the NACC database overall, history of diabetes had a null association with HS-Aging pathology.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	RESULTS	In this subsample, the odds of observing HS-Aging pathology were not increased for anti-diabetic agent users as a whole [age-adjusted OR = 1.43 (95 % CI: 0.75-2.71, p = 0.28)], for anti-diabetic agent users who never reported using a sulfonylurea [age-adjusted OR = 0.60 (95 % CI: 0.17-2.04, p = 0.41)], or for self-reported diabetes [age-adjusted OR = 1.08 (95 % CI: 0.58-2.03, p = 0.81)]
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	For a slightly younger group of research subjects, those dying age 80-84 (n = 261), among whom HS-Aging histopathology was relatively uncommon, post hoc sensitivity analyses indicated no association between sulfonylurea use and HS-Aging pathology [age-adjusted OR = 0.59 (95 % CI: 0.13-2.68)].
0	diabetes	NA	NA	RESULTS	Effect estimates in this group are similar for use of any anti-diabetic medication [age-adjusted OR = 0.33 (95 % CI: 0.07-1.42)] and self-reported diabetes [age-adjusted OR = 0.43 (95 % CI: 0.15-1.29)].
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Results in this slightly younger group of subjects, which included only 17 sulfonylurea users, did not support the hypothesis that sulfonylurea use is associated with HS-Aging pathology in this age group
0	NA	ATP-binding cassette, sub-family C member 9	NA	DISCUSS	In the large human autopsy cohorts studied, the risk of developing HS-Aging pathology was associated with polymorphism in the ABCC9 gene.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The effect size was relatively large (OR = 1.4-2.0 with additive MOI, 2.0-2.7 with recessive MOI) in all three Stage I cohorts and also in both Stage II cohorts.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In the final Stage II cohort, only a single polymorphism was queried so statistical correction for multiple testing was obviated.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The HS-Aging risk allele may be directly relevant to public health because aged human subjects in the NACC database with history of sulfonylurea exposure have increased risk for HS-Aging pathology
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	There are potential pitfalls inherent to the study design.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The Stage I GWAS did not produce a SNP that reached genome-wide statistical significance.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Bias was thus inserted into the study by selecting which SNPs would be analyzed in the Stage II cohorts.
0	NA	ATP-binding cassette, sub-family C member 9	NA	DISCUSS	Among the candidate SNPs from GWAS, ABCC9 polymorphisms ultimately yielded the lowest p values by an order of magnitude, so that locus was an obvious choice to evaluate.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Testing the association between sulfonylurea drug exposure and HS-Aging pathology in the NACC dataset is complicated by confounders and limitations.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	For example, the accuracy of medication self-report is imperfect since current medication use refers to the 2-week period prior to the clinical assessment, drug dosages were unknown, and some of the patients presumably used and discontinued sulfonylurea drugs prior to study enrollment as well as between annual study visits.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Patient age was also a relevant factor; we found that HS-Aging pathology is relatively unusual among individuals younger than age 85 and found no evidence for correlation between the sulfonylurea drugs and HS-Aging pathologically in the post hoc analysis of younger patients.
0	NA	ATP-binding cassette, sub-family C member 9	NA	DISCUSS	These analyses were also performed blind to patients' genotypes so the distribution of ABCC9 SNPs versus sulfonylurea use is unknown.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	For these reasons, the data on HS-Aging linked to drug exposure should be interpreted with caution
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The present study was not designed to evaluate polymorphisms that show weak associations with HS-Aging pathology.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	There were, however, some alleles from the GWAS that appear interesting despite failing to reach genome-wide statistical significance.
0	familial idiopathic basal ganglia calcification	CTAGE5	NA	DISCUSS	For example, SNPs within and near the cutaneous T-cell lymphoma-associated antigen 5 (CTAGE5) gene yielded p ~ 10-6 in the GWAS, and CTAGE5 polymorphisms have been linked to familial idiopathic basal ganglia calcification (Fahr's disease).

0	NA	ATP-binding cassette, sub-family C member 9	NA	DISCUSS	The main discovery of the present study is the association between HS-Aging pathology and polymorphism in the ABCC9 gene.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Meta-analyzed data indicate an overall OR = 1.62 with the additive MOI model:a relatively large effect size for a common allele.
0	Alzheimer's disease	ATP-binding cassette, sub-family C member 9	NA	DISCUSS	Notably, the chromosomal region in which ABCC9 resides (12p) has been linked to clinical late-onset AD risk, which may be at least partially explained by ABCC9, because HS-Aging tends to be misdiagnosed clinically as AD

1	NA	ATP-binding cassette, sub-family C member 9	rs704192	DISCUSS	In the genotype-tissue expression project (GTEx) database of expression quantitative trait loci, SNPs linked to HS-Aging pathology (particularly rs704192 which has D' > 0.9 with rs704178) also correlate with altered ABCC9 expression specifically in both human hippocampus and amygdala (both p < 0.05) but not cerebellum.
1	NA	ATP-binding cassette, sub-family C member 9	rs829080	DISCUSS	Using SNPExp web tool where SNPs are correlated with gene expression using transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines, SNPs linked to HS-Aging pathology (particularly rs829080, with D' = 1.0 with rs704178) correlate strongly with ABCC9 expression (p < 0.0001).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Despite these interesting observations, it is not yet proven that the HS-Aging risk SNP variability leads directly to changes in gene splicing, mRNA expression, or polypeptide function in human brain
