1	NA	SLC38A7	rs11648166	ABSTRACT	The top single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) signal mapped across SLC38A7 (rs11648166, P = 2.3E-08), which we showed to encode an anastrozole influx transporter.
0	NA	ALPPL2	rs28845026	ABSTRACT	The second most significant signal (rs28845026, P = 5.4E-08) mapped near ALPPL2 and displayed epistasis with the SLC38A7 signal.
0	NA	SLC38A7	NA	ABSTRACT	Both of these SNPs were cis expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL)s for these genes, and patients homozygous for variant genotypes for both SNPs had the highest drug concentrations, the highest SLC38A7 expression, and the lowest ALPPL2 expression.
0	NA	SLC38A7	NA	ABSTRACT	In summary, our GWAS identified a novel gene encoding an anastrozole transporter, SLC38A7, as well as epistatic interaction between SNPs in that gene and SNPs near ALPPL2 that influenced both the expression of the transporter and anastrozole plasma concentrations
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	  Anastrozole is a highly prescribed aromatase inhibitor that plays an important role in the management of postmenopausal women with endocrine therapy-sensitive breast cancer.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	However, no biomarkers for variation in plasma anastrozole concentrations have been reported, and no genome-wide association study for plasma anastrozole concentrations has been performed
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	  This study addressed the question of whether genetics might contribute to variation in plasma anastrozole concentrations in patients with hormone receptor positive breast cancer being treated with this drug
1	breast cancer	SLC38A7	rs11648166	INTRO	  The rs11648166 SNP in SLC38A7 and the rs28845026 SNP near ALPPL2 were associated with plasma anastrozole concentrations in patients with estrogen receptor positive breast cancer who received anastrozole therapy.
0	NA	SLC38A7	NA	INTRO	SLC38A7 is a transporter for anastrozole, and ALPPL2, by an epistatic mechanism, seems to repress SLC38A7 expression and, as a result, decreases anastrozole plasma concentrations
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	  This study provides genetic markers, single-nucleotide polymorphisms, for the possible individualization of plasma anastrozole dosing and, as a result, plasma drug concentrations.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	It also highlights the potential importance of epistasis as a pharmacogenomic mechanism
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are first-line adjuvant endocrine therapy for postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer.1, 2 Anastrozole is the most widely prescribed AI in the United States,3 and it was recently recommended in the United Kingdom for the prevention of breast cancer in high-risk women.4 Anastrozole reversibly and competitively inhibits aromatase, the enzyme that catalyzes the biosynthesis of estrogens from androgens.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The US Food and Drug Administration-approved dose of anastrozole is 1 mg/day, which results in average reductions of estradiol (E2) and estrone (E1) plasma concentrations of >= 83.5% and >= 86.5%, respectively.5
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Anastrozole undergoes both phase I and phase II metabolism.6 A large proportion of plasma anastrozole, a hydrophilic compound, is not metabolized,7, 8 with mean anastrozole concentrations that are 30-fold higher than are those of its most abundant metabolite, anastrozole-N-glucuronide.8 However, there is large interindividual variability in plasma anastrozole concentrations and in the occurrence of anastrozole treatment-related phenotypes.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Specifically, not all patients experience estrogen suppression during anastrozole therapy and, surprisingly, ~ 10% of patients experience either no change or an increase in plasma estrogen concentrations despite being adherent to therapy.9 Of greatest clinical importance, ~ 10% of patients receiving anastrozole experience breast cancer recurrence within 5 years, and there is also wide variation in the occurrence and severity of adverse drug reactions.10 Finally, no clear mechanistic links have been established between anastrozole plasma concentrations and long-term clinical outcomes and/or the occurrence of adverse reactions to this important antineoplastic drug
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In the present study, we set out to test the hypothesis that plasma anastrozole concentrations might be regulated, at least in part, by genetics.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	To test that hypothesis, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of plasma anastrozole concentrations in 687 postmenopausal patients with ER+ breast cancer enrolled in the Mayo Clinic-MD Anderson-Memorial Sloan Kettering (Mayo-MDA-MSK) Pharmacogenomics Research Network (PGRN) Breast Cancer Aromatase Inhibitor Pharmacogenomics study.
0	NA	SLC38A7	NA	INTRO	As described subsequently, we observed two major single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) signals:a genome-wide significant SNP signal across a transporter gene, SLC38A7, and a near genome-wide significant SNP signal that mapped near ALPPL2 as well as a novel epistatic relationship (i.e., the genotype of one locus influenced the phenotypic expression of the other locus) between these two SNP signals.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	These results provide novel insight into genomic influences on individual variation in plasma anastrozole concentrations, and they should also heighten sensitivity to the possibility that two separate genetic loci might interact to influence the same pharmacogenomic phenotype, in this case, plasma drug concentration
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	RESULTS	Plasma anastrozole concentrations in these patients with ER+ breast cancer were measured at a time when they had been on the once-a-day dose of the drug for several months, and patients were instructed not to take their dose of anastrozole for that day until after their blood sample had been drawn.

0	esophageal	SLC38A7	NA	RESULTS	This SNP was located ~ 3 kb downstream (3') of SLC38A7 and was an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) for that gene in multiple tissues, with the minor allele being associated with increased gene expression in several tissues, including esophageal mucosa, ovaries, etc.

1	NA	SLC38A7	rs11648166	RESULTS	That SNP had a minor allele frequency of 0.20 in our sample and the minor allele, like that for rs11648166 in SLC38A7, was associated with increased plasma anastrozole concentrations (P = 5.4E-08; Table 1) and was an eQTL for several of the genes that mapped near the SNP, including ECEL1 and ALPPL2.
0	NA	ALPPL2	rs28845026	RESULTS	According to GTEx, rs28845026 is an eQTL for ALPPL2 in transverse colon tissue with a P value of 9.7E-05, with the variant allele being associated with decreased ALPPL2 expression11 (Figure S2).
0	NA	ALPPL2	NA	RESULTS	The functional genomic studies described subsequently indicated that ALPPL2 had a significant effect on both SLC38A7 expression and anastrozole transport
1	NA	NA	rs11648166	RESULTS	As a step toward addressing the questions raised in preceding paragraphs, we created a linear regression model for possible additive SNP effects to test the possibility that there might be interaction between the top SNPs for the chromosome 16 signal (rs11648166) and the chromosome 2 GWAS signal (rs28845026).
1	NA	NA	rs11648166	RESULTS	This regression model tested the hypothesis that the effect of the rs11648166 SNP on plasma anastrozole concentrations might be modified by genotype for the rs28845026 SNP.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The interaction P value was 0.0227 (Table S3).

0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	However, we were able to study mechanism(s) by which these SNPs might influence plasma anastrozole concentrations as well as the epistatic interaction between the two SNP signals, so we next set out to study possible mechanisms that might explain these observations
1	NA	SLC38A7	rs11648166	RESULTS	The rs11648166 SNP on chromosome 16 mapped to the SLC38A7 gene, which is known to encode a glutamine influx transporter,12, 13 but SLC38A7 has not been reported to transport drugs, including anastrozole.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	In fact, no transporter for anastrozole had been reported previously.
0	NA	SLC38A7	NA	RESULTS	Therefore, our initial functional studies were designed to address the questions of whether SLC38A7 encoded a protein capable of transporting anastrozole into cells and, if that were the case, why might this SNP:for which the variant genotype was an eQTL associated with increased transporter expression:be associated with increased rather than decreased plasma drug concentrations.

0	NA	ALPPL2	NA	RESULTS	That SNP was a cis eQTL for ALPPL2 in the colon (P = 9.7E-05; Figure S2) and a cis eQTL for ECEL1P2 in the thyroid but, based on GTEx data, it was not an eQTL for the DIS3L2 or ALPP genes in any tissue.14 ALPP and ALPPL2 both encode membrane-bound alkaline phosphatases that are 98% identical in amino acid sequence.
0	fallopian tubes	ALPPL2	NA	RESULTS	Both alkaline phosphatases catalyze the dephosphorylation of a wide variety of phosphate monoesters,15, 16 and they are expressed in the placenta, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, lungs, and a variety of tumors.17, 18 In addition, ALPPL2, but not ALPP, is expressed in the gut, including the small intestine (both duodenum and terminal ileum),14 an expression pattern that might influence drug absorption.
0	NA	ALPPL2	rs28845026	RESULTS	Because ALPPL2 is expressed in the gut and because rs28845026 is an eQTL for ALPPL2, we focused our attention in subsequent experiments on the ALPPL2 gene
0	NA	SLC38A7	NA	RESULTS	HEK293T cells were chosen to study the potential roles of SLC38A7 and ALPPL2 in anastrozole transport because those cells did not express either protein.
0	NA	SLC38A7	NA	RESULTS	Because of their low background expression of drug transporters, HEK293T cells are often used to study specific drug-transporter pairs by overexpressing the transporter, followed by exposure to the drug.19 Immunofluorescence (IF) studies performed with SLC38A7 and ALPPL2 cDNA transfected HEK293T cells showed that both SLC38A7 and ALPPL2 localized to the plasma membrane of these cells (Figure  4a).

0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The cells were then exposed to anastrozole.
0	NA	SLC38A7	NA	RESULTS	Compared with cells transfected with empty vector, anastrozole concentrations in lysates from cells overexpressing SLC38A7 were significantly elevated after 60 and 90 minutes of incubation (Figure  5a), indicating anastrozole uptake by the cells.
0	NA	ALPPL2	NA	RESULTS	However, overexpression (OE) of ALPPL2 together with SLC38A7 prevented anastrozole uptake (Figure  5a), probably because of decreased SLC38A7 protein expression when SLC38A7 and ALPPL2 were co-overexpressed together when compared with SLC38A7 transfection alone (Figure  5b).
0	NA	SLC38A7	NA	RESULTS	These results were compatible with the conclusion that SLC38A7 is an inward transporter for anastrozole and that cotransfection with ALPPL2 decreased the expression of SLC38A7 and, thus, the inward transport of anastrozole.

0	NA	SLC38A7	NA	RESULTS	As a first step, we knocked down (KD) SLC38A7 in Caco2 cells.
0	NA	SLC38A7	rs28845026	RESULTS	KD of SLC38A7 had no effect on the expression of mRNA for genes in the gene cluster surrounding the chromosome 2 rs28845026 SNP (Figure  6a), whereas KD of ECEL1, NPPC, and ALPP all resulted in either no significant change or increased expression of SLC38A7 mRNA, and OE of ALPP and ALPPL2 resulted in significant decreases of SLC38A7 expression at the mRNA level (Figure  6b).
0	NA	ALPPL2	NA	RESULTS	Because of its low level of expression, it was not possible to KD ALPPL2 in these cells, but we were able to overexpress ALPPL2 in Caco2 cells, and we observed significant downregulation of the expression of both SLC38A7 mRNA and protein after the OE of ALPPL2 (Figure  6b,c).
0	NA	ALPPL2	NA	RESULTS	As mentioned previously, ALPPL2 and ALPP are 98% identical in their amino acid sequences, which may explain the decrease in SLC38A7 mRNA expression after OE of both ALPPL2 and ALPP in Caco2 cells (Figure  6b).
0	NA	ALPPL2	NA	RESULTS	However, only ALPPL2 is expressed in the gut, and the chromosome 2 SNP is an eQTL for ALPPL2 but not for ALPP.
0	NA	ALPPL2	NA	RESULTS	Therefore, ALPPL2 is the most likely candidate among the chromosome 2 genes to influence the variation in plasma anastrozole concentration that we studied with our GWAS.

0	NA	SLC38A7	NA	DISCUSS	We concluded that subjects homozygous for both allele genotypes displayed the highest overall SLC38A7 expression due, at least in part, to low ALPPL2 expression, and this fact explained why this group of women displayed the highest anastrozole plasma concentrations.
0	NA	ALPPL2	NA	DISCUSS	Future studies will obviously be required to fully elucidate the mechanism(s) underlying the effect of ALPPL2 on SLC38A7 mRNA and protein expression
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In summary, we have performed a GWAS for plasma anastrozole concentrations in postmenopausal women with ER+ breast cancer.
0	NA	SLC38A7	NA	DISCUSS	That GWAS resulted in the discovery of a novel anastrozole plasma membrane transporter, SLC38A7, as well as an epistatic relationship between the two top SNP signals:that near the SLC38A7 gene on chromosome 16 and that near the ALPPL2 gene on chromosome 2.
0	NA	SLC38A7	NA	DISCUSS	Functional studies supported a chromosome 2 SNP by chromosome 16 SNP effect on SLC38A7 expression and showed that ALPPL2 influenced the expression and the anastrozole transport activity of SLC38A7.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This series of observations, beyond their implications for the possible individualization of clinical dosing of anastrozole, an extremely important drug for the adjuvant treatment of ER+ breast cancer, also serve to emphasize the potentially important role of epistasis as a pharmacogenomic mechanism
