0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	In stage 1, whole genome genotyping using the Illumina HumanHap550-Duo BeadChip was performed by deCODE Genetics (Reykjavik, Iceland).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Genotype calling was performed using the standard procedure implemented in BeadStudio (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), with the default parameters suggested by the platform manufacturer.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Quality control of genotype data was performed by examining several summary statistics.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	First, the ratio of loci with heterozygous calls on the X chromosome was calculated to double-check the subject's gender.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Total successful call rate and the minor allele frequency of cases and controls were also calculated for each SNP.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	SNPs were excluded if they: (1) were nonpolymorphic in both cases and controls, (2) had a total call rate <95% in the cases and controls combined, (3) had a minor allele frequency <5% and a total call rate <99% in the cases and controls combined, and (4) had significant distortion from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in the controls (P<10-7).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Genotyping validation was performed using the Sequenom iPLEX assay (Sequenom MassARRAY system; Sequenom, San Diego, CA, USA).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	In the replication stage (stage 2), SNPs showing significant or suggestive associations with T2D and their neighboring SNPs within the same LD block were genotyped using the Sequenom iPLEX assay.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The neighboring SNPs in the same LD were selected from the HapMap Asian (CHB + JPT) group data for fine mapping the significant signal
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	T2D association analysis was carried out to compare allele frequency and genotype distribution between cases and controls using five single-point methods for each SNP: genotype, allele, trend (Cochran-Armitage test), dominant, and recessive models.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The most significant test statistic obtained from the five models was chosen.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	SNPs with P values less than a = 2x10-8, a cut-off for the multiple comparison adjusted by Bonferroni correction, were considered to be significantly associated with the traits.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The joint analysis was conducted by combining the data from the stage 1 and 2 samples.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We also applied Fisher's method to combine P values for joint analysis.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The permutation test was carried out genome-wide for 106 permutations, in which the phenotypes of subjects were randomly rearranged.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	For better estimation of empirical P values, the top SNPs were reexamined using 108 permutations.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Each permutation proceeded as follows: (1) the case and control labels were shuffled and redistributed to subjects, and (2) the test statistics of the corresponding association test was calculated based on the shuffled labels.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The empirical P value was defined as the number of permutations that were at least as extreme as the original divided by the total number of permutations.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Detection of possible population stratification that might influence association analysis was carried out using principle component analysis, multidimensional scaling analysis, and genomic control (Text S1).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots were then used to examine P value distributions (Figure 3 and Figure S5)
0	NA	NA	NA	FIG	Q-Q plots are shown for the trend test based on the 516,212 quality SNPs of the initial analysis of 995 cases and 894 controls.
0	NA	NA	NA	FIG	The red lines represent the upper and lower boundaries of the 95% confidence bands
