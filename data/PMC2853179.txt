0	pancreatic cancer	ABO blood group	NA	INTRO	We recently reported common risk variants for pancreatic cancer that map to the first intron of the ABO gene on chromosome 9q34.2 based on a genome-wide association study of 1,896 individuals diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and 1,939 controls.
0	pancreatic cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Individuals were drawn from 12 prospective cohort studies (the Pancreatic Cancer Cohort Consortium) and one hospital-based case-control study, the Mayo Clinic Molecular Epidemiology of Pancreatic Cancer Study (see Online Methods).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	In the first scan, we genotyped approximately 550,000 SNPs and followed up the most significant SNPs that had been found in eight case-control studies (see Online Methods)
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	To identify additional loci, we conducted a second GWAS in which we genotyped approximately 620,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in an additional 1,955 cases and 1,995 controls drawn from the same eight case-control studies used to replicate the initial GWAS finding on chromosome 9q34.2.

0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	adjusted for study, age, sex, self-described ancestry and five principal components of population stratification.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot showed little evidence for inflation of the test statistics as compared to the expected distribution (lambda=1.013), that excludes the likelihood of substantial hidden population substructure or differential genotype calling between cases and controls (Supplemental Figure 1).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	A Manhattan plot displays the results of the combined GWAS (Supplemental Figure 2A) and the results from the case-control studies including the full Mayo data set (Supplemental Figure 2B).
0	pancreatic cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Our combined analysis identified three novel genomic regions on chromosomes 13q22.1, 1q32.1 and 5p15.33 associated with pancreatic cancer risk that were below the threshold for genome-wide significance (P<5x10-7) shown in Table 1 and Figure 1.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Two different haplotype analyses were conducted for each of the three regions, a regularized regression approach and a sequential haplotype scan method, both of which employ different test statistics (see Online Methods).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Haplotype analysis across each of the three regions did not identify new or independent markers, thus indicating that the current tag SNPs probably point to single loci in each region (Supplemental Figure 3)
1	NA	NA	rs9543325	INTRO	For the locus on 13q22.1, we observed two highly significant SNPs that ranked number 1 and 6 in the combined analysis: rs9543325 (P=3.27x10-11; per allele OR 1.26, 95% CI=1.18-1.35; unconstrained ORHet 1.23, 95% CI=1.11-1.36 and ORHom 1.61, 95% CI=1.40-1.86) and rs9564966 (P=5.86x10-8; per allele OR 1.21, 95% CI=1.13-1.30; unconstrained ORHet 1.21, 95% CI=1.09-1.34 and ORHom=1.48, 95% CI=1.27-1.72).

1	NA	KLF5	rs9564966	INTRO	SNP rs9564966 was no longer nominally significant after adjusting for rs9543325 (P=0.47), suggesting the two SNPs mark a single signal in the non-genic region of approximately 600 kb between two genes in the family of kruppel-like transcription factors, KLF5 and KLF12 that regulate cell growth and transformation.
0	cancers	BRCA1	NA	INTRO	This segment of chromosome 13 is frequently deleted in a spectrum of cancers, including pancreatic cancer and may harbor a breast cancer susceptibility locus based on linkage analysis in breast cancer families negative for mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes
1	NA	NR5A2	NA	INTRO	Five highly significant SNPs (ranked 2, 3, 4, 7 and 9 in the combined analysis; P<=5x10-7) map to a region of chromosome 1q32.1, that harbors the nuclear receptor subfamily 5, group A, member 2 (NR5A2) gene.
1	NA	NR5A2	NA	INTRO	The SNPs are distributed across a 105 kb genomic region, which includes the 5' end of NR5A2 extending to 91 kb upstream of the gene.
1	NA	NR5A2	rs3790844	INTRO	The two most significant SNPs in this region map to the first intron of NR5A2 (rs3790844, P=2.45x10-10; per allele OR.0.77, 95% CI=0.71-0.84; unconstrained ORHet 0.75, 95% CI=0.68-0.83 and unconstrained ORHom 0.64, 95% CI=0.52-0.79) and approximately 32 kb upstream of the gene (rs10919791, P=6.37x10-10; per allele OR 0.77, 95% CI=0.71-0.84; unconstrained ORHet 0.76, 95% CI=0.68-0.84 and unconstrained ORHom 0.63, 95% CI=0.50-0.79)).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The LD between these two SNPs is high, r2=0.81 in study controls and r2=0.71 in HapMap CEU.
0	NA	NA	rs3790843	INTRO	In this region, there were three additional SNPs, rs3790843, rs12029406 and rs4465241 that were highly significant (P < 5x10-7).
1	NA	NA	rs3790843	INTRO	Of these three SNPs, the telomeric one, rs3790843 is highly correlated with rs3790844 and rs10919791 (r2 of 0.59 and 0.72 in PanScan European controls).
1	NA	NA	rs3790844	INTRO	The two SNPs centromeric to rs3790844 and rs10919791 are not as strongly correlated (r2=0.05-0.38 in PanScan European controls).
1	NA	NA	rs3790844	INTRO	In an analysis adjusted for the most highly associated SNP, rs3790844, three of the other four SNPs, namely, rs10919791, rs3790843, and rs12029406 were no longer nominally significant (p>0.05) whereas the significance of the association with rs4465241 (which had the lowest LD) decreased by several orders of magnitude after adjustment (p=0.004).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Together these findings suggest that the five SNPs mark a single common allele, but further fine-mapping is needed
1	exocrine pancreas	NR5A2	NA	INTRO	NR5A2 encodes a nuclear receptor of the fushi tarazu (Ftz-F1) subfamily that is predominantly expressed in exocrine pancreas, liver, intestine and ovaries in adults.
0	NA	NR5A2	NA	INTRO	The widespread expression of NR5A2 in early embryos and early lethality of knockout mice implies a critical role in development.
1	NA	NR5A2	NA	INTRO	NR5A2 plays a role in cholesterol and bile acid homeostasis, steroidogenesis and cell proliferation (for review see).
1	haploinsufficiency	NR5A2	NA	INTRO	Evidence for its involvement in transformation stems from the fact that NR5A2 interacts with beta-catenin to activate expression of cell cycle genes while haploinsufficiency of NR5A2 attenuates intestinal tumor formation in the ApcMin/+ tumor model
1	NA	NA	rs401681	INTRO	The third locus identified is marked by rs401681 (P=3.66x10-7; per allele OR 1.19, 95% CI=1.11-1.27; unconstrained ORHet 1.20, 95% CI=1.07-1.34 and unconstrained ORHom 1.41, 95% CI=1.23-1.61), which maps to chromosome 5p15.33.
1	alias CRR9; cleft lip and palate	CLPTM1L	NA	INTRO	It resides in intron 13 of the cleft lip and palate transmembrane 1-like gene (CLPTM1L), part of the CLPTM1L-TERT locus that includes the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (TERT), only 23 kb away.
1	NA	CLPTM1L	NA	INTRO	Both genes have been implicated in carcinogenesis: the CLPTM1L gene is up-regulated in cisplatin-resistant cell lines and may play a role in apopotosis whereas the TERT gene encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase, essential for maintaining telomere ends.
0	NA	TERT	NA	INTRO	When over-expressed in normal cells, TERT can lead to prolonged cell lifespan and transformation.
0	cancers	NA	NA	INTRO	While telomerase activity cannot be detected in most normal tissues, it is seen in approximately 90% of human cancers.
0	cancers	NA	NA	INTRO	This region of chromosome 5p15.33 has been identified in genome-wide association studies of a number of different cancers, including brain tumors, lung cancer, basal cell carcinoma, melanoma and now pancreatic cancer.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	In a recent analysis of lung cancer in smokers, the signal on chromosome 5p15.33 has been shown to be strongly associated with the adenocarcinoma histology subtype.
0	pancreatic cancer	NA	rs402710	INTRO	Moreover, variants in this region, in LD with our strongest signal, rs402710, have been suggested to be associated with levels of smoking-related bulky aromatic DNA adducts, a relevant mechanism for pancreatic cancer which is also tobacco related.
0	acute myelogenous leukemia	TERT	NA	INTRO	Germ-line mutations have been shown to contribute to the development of acute myelogenous leukemia, whereas mutations in TERT account for a proportion of individuals with an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome that is prone to hematologic malignancies.
1	cancers	NA	rs401681	INTRO	SNPs in the CLPTM1L-TERT region, including rs401681, also have shown possible associations in additional cancers, namely bladder and prostate cancer.
1	bladder and prostate cancer	NA	rs401681	INTRO	Of note, the C allele of rs401681 is associated with an increased risk of lung, prostate and bladder cancers as well as basal cell carcinoma whereas the T allele is associated with increased risk of pancreatic cancer (this study) and melanoma.
1	NA	CLPTM1L	rs4635969	INTRO	Lastly, a highly suggestive SNP in this region that did not meet genome-wide significance, rs4635969 (ranked 12th in combined analysis, P=1.05x10-6) is located between the CLPTM1L and TERT genes (r2=0.26 in 3,650 study controls and r2=0.36 in HapMap CEU)
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	It is notable that the estimated odds ratio for the variants meeting genome-wide significance on chromosomes 13q22, 1q32 and 5p15 were consistent when restricted to data from either the case-control studies or the cohort studies.
0	NA	ABO blood group	rs505922	INTRO	This similarity of estimated effect size between the two study designs was also observed for rs505922 in the ABO locus in our previous report.
0	NA	ABO blood group	NA	INTRO	The consistency of effect supports a role for loci at 13q22.1, 1q32.1, 5p15.33 and ABO, and the divergent results for SHH (reported earlier) on chromosome 7q36 indicate the need for further investigation of the potential influence of study sampling design on detection of regions using the GWAS strategy
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	GWAS have emerged as a powerful, hypothesis-independent approach to identify common alleles that influence disease risk.
0	pancreatic cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Our results show that pancreatic cancer is similar to other complex diseases, in that multiple common disease alleles with small effects influence disease risk.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Our study has good power to detect common alleles with large effects (over 90% power to detect a per allele relative risk of 1.4 or greater for an allele with 10% frequency at the alpha=5x10-7 level) but less power to detect smaller effect sizes.
0	pancreatic cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Thus, although it is unlikely that there are common alleles with large effects on the majority of sporadic pancreatic cancer risk, it is likely that additional susceptibility alleles with moderate to small effects exist.
0	pancreatic cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	The list of susceptibility alleles should increase as further GWAS are performed for pancreatic cancer to catalogue the variants with estimated risks below 1.3.
0	pancreatic cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Additional studies are needed to assess the clinical utility of risk stratification that combines genetic markers with epidemiologic risk factors already established for pancreatic cancer, namely adiposity, smoking, diabetes and family history
0	pancreatic cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Our combined analysis of 3,851 individuals with pancreatic cancer and 3,934 controls has yielded three new genomic regions associated with the risk of pancreatic cancer.
0	cancers	NA	NA	INTRO	Two regions harbor candidate genes while the third locus on chromosome 13q22.1 maps to a large nongenic region analogous to the 8q24 region; however, though the latter is associated with risk of multiple cancers, including prostate, breast, colorectal and bladder cancers, the locus on chromosome 13q22.1 appears to be specific for pancreatic cancer.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	The CPTM1L-TERT region on chromosome 5p15.33 has been implicated in a disease spectrum that also includes lung cancer, brain tumors, acute myelogenous leukemia, bone marrow failure syndromes and pulmonary fibrosis.
0	prostate carcinogenesis	NA	NA	INTRO	The fine-mapping of signals in the three regions identified by our GWAS should guide selection of the optimal variants for functional studies into the biological mechanism underpinning pancreatic carcinogenesis.
