0	breast cancer	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Here, the authors perform a case-only genome-wide association study and highlight novel loci associated with breast cancer risk for BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation carriers
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer in women worldwide and BC family history is one of the most important risk factors for the disease.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Women with a history of BC in a first-degree relative are about two times more likely to develop BC than women without a family history.
0	NA	BRCA1	NA	INTRO	Around 15-20% of the familial risk of BC can be explained by rare mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes.
0	NA	BRCA1	NA	INTRO	A recent prospective cohort study estimated the cumulative risk of BC by 80 years to be 72% for BRCA1 mutation carriers and 69% for BRCA2 mutation carriers.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	This study also demonstrated that BC risk for mutation carriers varies by family history of BC in first and second degree relatives, suggesting the existence of other genetic factors that modify BC risks
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	A total of 179 common BC susceptibility single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or small insertions or deletions (INDELs) have been identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in the general population.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Although risk alleles at individual SNPs (hereafter used as a generic term to refer to common variants, which also includes the small INDELs) are associated with modest increases in BC risk, it has been shown that they combine multiplicatively on risk, resulting in substantial levels of BC risk stratification in the population.
0	NA	BRCA1	NA	INTRO	Similarly, more than 50 of the common genetic BC susceptibility variants have also been shown to be associated with BC for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers and their joint effects, summarised as polygenic risk scores (PRS), result in large differences in the absolute risks of developing BC for mutation carriers at the extremes of the PRS distribution.
0	NA	BRCA1	NA	INTRO	BC GWAS for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers have been carried out through the Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA1/2 (CIMBA).
0	NA	BRCA1	NA	INTRO	However, despite the large number of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers included, the power to detect genetic modifiers of risk remains limited in comparison to that available in the general population.
0	NA	BRCA1	NA	INTRO	To date, no variants specifically associated with BC risk for BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers have been identified
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Here, we apply a novel strategy using a case-only GWAS design, in which SNP genotype frequencies in 7,257 BRCA1 and 5,097 BRCA2 mutation carrier BC cases are compared to those in 60,212 BC cases from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC), unselected for mutation status.
0	NA	BRCA1	NA	INTRO	We aim (1) to identify novel SNPs that modify BC risk for BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers but are not associated with risk in the general population and (2) for the known 179 BC susceptibility SNPs, assess whether there is evidence of an interaction between the SNPs and BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations and therefore evaluate whether the SNP effect size estimates applicable to mutation carriers are different

0	breast cancer	BRCA1	NA	RESULTS	For BRCA1 mutation carriers, previous studies have demonstrated heterogeneity in the associations of the SNPs with ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancer.
0	NA	BRCA1	NA	RESULTS	Since BRCA1 mutation carriers develop primarily ER-negative BC, to comprehensively assess the evidence of interaction with BRCA1 mutation status, we followed a two-step process; we first assessed the associations using all BC cases from BCAC and then we restricted the comparison to BCAC ER-negative BC cases.
0	NA	BRCA1	NA	RESULTS	Of the 158 SNPs, 59 were associated with BRCA1 mutation carrier status when compared to all BC cases (P < 0.05, Supplementary Data 1).

0	NA	BRCA1	NA	RESULTS	The OR estimates for association with BRCA1 mutation status for these six SNPs were similar under both case-only analyses (all BC and ER-negative BC cases analyses) and varied from 0.85 to 1.07, suggesting that the magnitude of their associations with BC risk for BRCA1 mutation carriers differs from that observed in the general population.
0	NA	BRCA1	NA	RESULTS	For the other 152 SNPs, there was no evidence of association with BRCA1 mutation status when compared against the ER-negative BC cases from BCAC (Supplementary Data 1), suggesting that the OR estimated using case-control data from BCAC are also applicable to BRCA1 mutation carriers

0	NA	BRCA1	NA	RESULTS	Among the remaining 172 SNPs (152 + 20) that showed no associations with BRCA1 mutation status, the estimated ORcomputed was smaller (i.e., closer to 1) than those estimated in the general population (ORBCAC) for 146 SNPs  (85%, Supplementary Data 1 and 2).

0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The lack of target gene predictions may be due to reliance on breast cell line data which does not represent the in vivo tissue of interest or due to the fact that the target transcripts are not annotated
0	NA	STARD13	NA	DISCUSS	Only one gene, STARD13, was predicted as a potential target of SNPs at 13q13.1.
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This tumour suppressor gene has been previously implicated in metastasis, cell proliferation and development of BC.
0	NA	NA	rs736596	DISCUSS	However, rs736596, localized at 13q13.1, showed no association in CIMBA analyses and the association observed in our case-only analysis showed heterogeneity by country
0	NA	ETAA1	NA	DISCUSS	At the 2p14 locus, INQUISIT-predicted target genes included ETAA1 with lower confidence.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The OR estimates obtained in the case-only analysis for the SNPs located in this gene were consistent with the HR estimated in previously reported CIMBA analyses.
0	NA	BRCA2	NA	DISCUSS	Moreover, around one hundred correlated SNPs, were associated with BRCA2 mutation carrier status at p < 10-8, including the genotyped SNP chr2_67654113_C_T
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The validity of the case-only analysis as evidence of interaction relies on the assumption of independence between the mutation status and the SNPs under investigation.
0	NA	BRCA1	NA	DISCUSS	Therefore, based on the control-only analyses, we excluded ~2,000 SNPs which were associated with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carrier status and also showed an association with risk in the case-only analyses (Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	5).
0	NA	BRCA1	NA	DISCUSS	While most of these associations are probably spurious, due to (intra- or inter-chromosomal) LD with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, it is possible that some may reflect true associations and that the higher frequency in unaffected BRCA1/2 may be because they are relatives of BC cases.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	These associations may warrant further evaluation using other study designs.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	A recent publication using data from the Framingham Heart Study suggested that interchromosomal LD can be caused by bio-genetic mechanisms possibly associated with favourable or unfavourable epistatic evolution.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	SNPs for which no association with mutation carrier status was found at the significance level of 10-8 were assumed to be independent of the mutation status.
0	NA	BRCA1	NA	DISCUSS	However, this does not necessarily rule out residual LD between the novel SNPs on chromosomes 13 and 17 and BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Therefore, the OR estimates for these SNPs might be biased and may further explain the lack of evidence of association in the CIMBA only analyses
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our findings highlight the importance of imputation in GWAS.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The imputed genome-wide genotype data used in the main case-only association analyses were based on carrying out the imputation separately for the BC cases from BCAC and CIMBA.
0	NA	BRCA1	NA	DISCUSS	We found that 28 out of the 33 regions associated with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carrier status were no longer associated with risk after re-imputing all samples together.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	By re-imputing all the data together we ensured that the associations observed for the remaining regions are robust to potential differences in the imputation accuracy between the BCAC and CIMBA samples
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Under our analytical strategy, only the regions for which evidence of associated with BC risk was observed were re-imputed using all BCAC and CIMBA samples combined.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This re-imputation was not done at genome-wide level due to computational constraints and this may have led to false-negative associations being excluded for further evaluation as potential novel modifiers.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Future analyses should aim to analyse the genome-wide associations after the genome-wide re-imputation across the combined BCAC and CIMBA dataset.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, our approach using joint one-step imputation should have ensured that associations we report (all of which are common SNPs with imputation scores > 0.5) are not driven by inaccuracies in imputation
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Due to the recruitment of participants in CIMBA studies primarily through genetic counselling, the mean age at diagnosis of mutation carriers was 16 years younger than the BC cases participating in BCAC.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Although all analyses were adjusted for age, the observed associations might be related to the ageing process instead of interactions with mutation carrier status.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Another source of bias could be related to the fact that there are 1.5 times more prevalent cases among CIMBA (68.1%) than BCAC (42.3%) with a delay between diagnosis and study recruitment of 6.83 years and 2.07 years respectively.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	An observed association might be due to a differential survival between CIMBA and BCAC cases.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, none of the identified SNPs has been found to be associated with BC survival
0	NA	BRCA1	NA	DISCUSS	The majority (92.5%) of cases and controls in BCAC were not tested for BRCA1/2 mutations at the time of enrolment, potentially leading to some attenuation in the interaction OR (as some BCAC cases will be carriers).
0	NA	BRCA1	NA	DISCUSS	However, most BCAC studies were population-based case-control studies and the proportion of cases and controls that carry pathogenic BRCA1/2 mutations will be small (<5%), hence any attenuation is likely to be negligible
0	NA	BRCA2	rs79183898	DISCUSS	Despite heterogeneity in the interaction ORs by country for some SNPs, results were generally robust to the exclusion of each country sequentially except, for two SNPs (rs79183898 and rs736596) found associated with BRCA2 mutation carrier status; for these, the association seemed to be driven by data from the USA.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	For the other SNPs, the observed heterogeneity may be due to random error, given the relatively small sample sizes of each country.
0	NA	BRCA1	NA	DISCUSS	However, if these differences are real, future PRS for BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers should consider the country-specific differences
0	NA	BRCA1	NA	DISCUSS	This is the first analysis of genetic modifiers of BC risk that investigated the differences in the association of common genetic variants with BC risk in the general population and in women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The inclusion of unselected BC cases resulted in increased sample size and hence a gain in statistical power for identifying novel SNPs.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	These represent the largest currently available datasets, but it is important to replicate these observations in independent samples.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This should be possible through the ongoing CONFLUENCE (https://dceg.cancer.gov/research/cancer-types/breast-cancer/confluence-project) large-scale genotyping experiment.
0	NA	BRCA1	NA	DISCUSS	More detailed fine mapping and functional analysis will be required to elucidate the role of the novel variants identified in BC development for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers.
0	NA	BRCA1	NA	DISCUSS	Our findings should contribute to the improved performance of BC PRS for absolute risk prediction for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers, which will help inform decisions on the best timing for risk-reducing surgery, risk reduction medication, or the start of surveillance
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We used data from two international consortia, BCAC and CIMBA.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	BCAC included data from 108 studies of BC from 33 countries in North America, Europe and Australia, the majority (88%) of which were case-control studies.
0	NA	BRCA1	NA	METHODS	The majority of BCAC cases/controls were not tested for BRCA1/2 mutations at the time of enrolment.
0	NA	BRCA1	NA	METHODS	However, most studies were population-based, hence the proportion of cases and controls that carry pathogenic BRCA1/2 mutations will be small.
0	NA	BRCA1	NA	METHODS	CIMBA participants were women with pathogenic mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	All participants were at least 18 years old.
0	cancers	NA	NA	METHODS	The majority of mutation carriers were recruited through cancer genetics clinics and enroled into national or regional studies.
0	NA	BRCA1	NA	METHODS	Data were available on 30,500 BRCA1 mutation carriers and 20,500 BRCA2 mutation carriers from 77 studies in 32 countries.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	A total of 188,320 BC cases and 161,669 controls were available from both consortia.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	All studies provided information on disease status, age at diagnosis or at interview.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Oestrogen receptor status was available for 72% of BCAC cases and 71% of CIMBA cases.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	All subjects provided written informed consent and participated in studies with protocols approved by ethics committees at each participating institution
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	BCAC cases were women diagnosed with BC.
0	Colon and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer	NA	NA	METHODS	To define disease status in CIMBA participants, women were censored at the first of the following events: age at BC diagnosis, age at ovarian cancer diagnosis, other cancer, bilateral prophylactic mastectomy or age at study recruitment.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Subjects censored at a BC diagnosis were considered as cases
0	NA	BRCA1	NA	METHODS	A control-only analysis was carried out to test the independence between the SNPs and the BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carrier status.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	In BCAC, controls were defined as individuals unaffected by BC at study recruitment.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	In CIMBA, participants were considered as controls if they were unaffected at recruitment
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Only women of European ancestry were included.
0	cancers	HER2	NA	METHODS	To minimise the chance of observing spurious associations due to differences in the distribution of BC cases in the population by tumour characteristics (defined as unselected BC cases), 3,478 BCAC cases from four studies were excluded because they were included in clinical trials based on breast tumour characteristics as HER-2 receptor status (see Supplementary Table 2).
0	NA	BRCA1	NA	METHODS	Because all the analyses were adjusted for country, to ensure that the number of subjects in each country stratum was large enough, we excluded the CIMBA data from any country for which there were less than ten BC cases with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation.
0	NA	BRCA2	NA	METHODS	Consequently, data from Poland and Russia were excluded from the BRCA2 analyses (Supplementary Table 3).
0	NA	BRCA1	NA	METHODS	Finally, duplicate subjects between BCAC and CIMBA were excluded from the BCAC data (114 and 80 subjects from the BRCA1 and BRCA2 case-only analyses, respectively; eight subjects from control-only analyses)
0	NA	BRCA1	NA	METHODS	A total of 60,212 BCAC cases and 7,257 BRCA1 mutation carrier cases were available for the BRCA1 case-only analyses and 57,725 BCAC cases and 5097 BRCA2 mutation carrier cases were available for the BRCA2 case-only analyses (Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	1).
0	NA	BRCA1	NA	METHODS	A total of 45,881 BCAC controls and 5,750 BRCA1 mutation carrier controls were available for the BRCA1 control-only analyses and 43,549 BCAC controls and 4,456 BRCA2 mutation carrier controls for the BRCA2 control-only analyses (Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	2)
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	All the study samples were genotyped using the OncoArray Illumina beadchip.
0	cancers	NA	NA	METHODS	The array includes a backbone of ~260,000 SNPs that provide genome-wide coverage of most common variants, together with markers of interest for breast and other cancers identified through GWAS, fine-mapping of known susceptibility regions, and other approaches
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	A standard genotype quality control process was followed for both the BCAC and CIMBA samples which have been described in detail elsewhere.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Briefly, this involved excluding SNPs located on chromosome Y; SNPs with call rates <95%; SNPs with MAF < 0.05 and call rate <98%; monomorphic SNPs; and SNPs for which evidence of departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was observed (P < 10-7 based on a country-stratified test)
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Genotypes for ~21 million SNPs were imputed for all subjects using the 1000 Genomes Phase III data (released October 2014) as reference panel, as described previously.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Briefly, the number of reference haplotypes used as templates when imputing missing genotypes was fixed to 800 (-k_hap = 800).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	A two-stage imputation approach was used: phasing with SHAPEIT and imputation with IMPUTE2 using 5 Mb non-overlapping intervals.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Genotypes were imputed for all SNPs that were found polymorphic (MAF > 0.1%) in either European or Asian populations
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The genome-wide imputation process described above was carried out separately for the BCAC and CIMBA samples.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	However, this may potentially lead to spurious associations if there are differences in the quality of the imputation (measured using the imputation accuracy r2 metric) for a given SNP between the two datasets.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	To address this, a stringent approach was employed which involved including only SNPs for which the difference in r2 between the BCAC and CIMBA SNP imputations (Deltar2) was minimal relative to their r2 values.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	SNPs with r2 > 0.9 in both BCAC and CIMBA were kept in the analyses only if Deltar2 < 0.05; SNPs with 0.8 < r2 <= 0.9 in both BCAC and CIMBA were kept if Deltar2 < 0.02 and, SNPs with 0.5 < r2 <= 0.8 in both BCAC and CIMBA were kept if Deltar2 < 0.01.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	All SNPs with r2 < 0.5 in either CIMBA or BCAC were excluded.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Only SNPs with a MAF > 0.01 in BCAC cases were included
0	NA	BRCA1	NA	METHODS	Consequently, 9,072,535 SNPs were included in the BRCA1 analyses (402,336 genotyped and 8,670,199 imputed SNPs) and 9,047,403 SNPs in the BRCA2 analyses (402,397 genotyped and 8,645,006 imputed SNPs)
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The comparison of SNP frequency between CIMBA cases and BCAC cases (case-only analyses), or between unaffected CIMBA subjects and BCAC controls (control-only analyses), was performed using logistic regression adjusted for age at BC diagnosis in the case-only analyses and for age at interview for BCAC controls or at censure for CIMBA unaffected subjects in the control-only analyses, as well as for country and principal components (PCs) to account for population structure.
0	NA	BRCA1	NA	METHODS	Separate analyses were carried out for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	To define the number of PC for inclusion in the models, the principal component analysis was carried out using 35,858 uncorrelated genotyped SNPs on the OncoArray and purpose-written software (http://ccge.medschl.cam.ac.uk/software/pccalc/).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The inflation statistic was calculated and converted to an equivalent statistic for a study of 1,000 subjects for each outcome (lambda1,000) by adjusting for effective study size:where n and m are the numbers of BCAC and CIMBA subjects respectively.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The models were adjusted with the first four PCs (lambda1,000 with and without PCs in the model = 1.03 and 1.21, respectively) since additional PCs did not result in further reduction in the inflation of the test statistics
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The analytical process is summarised in Figs.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	3 and 4.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	A fundamental assumption when using a case-only design in this context is that the SNPs and mutation carrier status are independent.
0	NA	BRCA1	NA	METHODS	To confirm independence, SNPs likely to be in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, i.e., those located in or within 500 kb of either gene, were excluded.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	However, LD also exists between variants at long-distance on the same chromosome or even on a different chromosome (interchromosomal LD).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Therefore, control-only analyses were performed to further exclude SNPs associated with mutation carrier status in unaffected women, using a stringent statistical significance level of 10-8)
0	NA	BRCA1	NA	METHODS	After excluding SNPs in LD or in interchromosomal LD with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, case-only analyses were performed to assess the association between SNPs and BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carrier status.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We considered two categories of SNPs depending on whether they had been previously found to be associated with BC in published BCAC studies.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	For known BC susceptibility SNPs (Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	3) we used a significance threshold of 2.7 x 10-4 (applying Bonferroni correction to 179 tests) and for potential novel SNP modifier (Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	4) a stringent significance threshold of 10-8 was used
0	cancers	NA	NA	METHODS	Because BRCA1mutation-associated tumours are more often ER-negative than those in the general population, a subsequent case-only analysis was performed restricting the BCAC cases to those with ER-negative disease.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We used this strategy for two reasons.
0	cancers	NA	NA	METHODS	First, we wished to exclude associations driven by differences in the tumour ER-status distributions between BRCA1 carriers and BCAC cases.
0	NA	BRCA1	NA	METHODS	Therefore, in the BRCA1 analysis, SNPs were considered to be associated with mutation carrier status only if they were also associated in the ER-negative case-only analysis at a prior defined significance threshold of 10-7 for novel SNP modifiers (Fig.
0	NA	BRCA1	NA	METHODS	4) and of 0.05 for the established BC susceptibility SNPs after a pre-selection at P < 2.7 x 10-4 in the BRCA1 overall case-only analysis (Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	3).
0	cancers	NA	NA	METHODS	The second reason we applied this strategy was to identify novel SNP modifiers specific to BRCA1/ER-negative tumours that had not been detected in the overall analysis; for this we applied a significance threshold of 10-8
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	To confirm that potentially novel associations in the case-only analysis were not driven by differences in the imputation accuracy between the CIMBA and BCAC data, each of the regions defined as +-500 kb around the associated SNP, were re-imputed for the combined CIMBA and BCAC samples.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	The more accurate one-stage imputation was carried out, using IMPUTE2 without pre-phasing.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Associations with all the SNPs in the re-imputed regions were then re-evaluated using the control-only and case-only analytical approaches described above.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Finally, we used a step-wise regression analysis using a significance threshold of 10-8 in order to determine whether associations with SNPs in the same region are independent and to define the conditionally independent SNPs (top SNPs)
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Among the 179 established BC susceptibility SNPs, 107 were genotyped and 71 were imputed.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	As previously, although none of these 71 SNPs were excluded based on their Deltar2, to exclude potentially spurious associations, regions around these 71 SNPs were re-imputed using the one-stage imputation applied to BCAC and CIMBA data combined, and before performing the control-only and case-only analyses
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	For the potentially novel SNP modifiers the risk ratio of BC applicable to mutation carriers was assumed to be equal to the OR estimate from the case-only analysis (with the hypothesis that their relative risk equals 1 in the general population, given that none of them was found to be associated with BC in BCAC)
0	NA	BRCA1	NA	METHODS	For the known BC susceptibility SNPs, a significant association in the case-only analysis implies that the magnitude of association is different for BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers than for the general population.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Therefore, the risk ratio of BC for mutation carriers was computed as the product of OR x ORBCAC where OR was obtained from the case-only analysis, and ORBCAC was the odds ratio of association obtained from either Michailidou et al.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	for the SNPs associated with overall BC risk and from Milne et al.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	for the SNPs associated with ER-negative BC
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	For all associated SNPs in case-only analyses, heterogeneity by country was assessed using likelihood ratio tests that compared models with and without an SNP by country interaction term.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	When the heterogeneity test was significant at P < 0.05, a leave-one-out analysis was performed, by excluding each country in turn to assess the influence of a data from a specific country on the overall association
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	For each novel region, we defined sets of credible causal variants (CCVs) to use in the prediction of the likely target genes.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	For this purpose, we defined a first set of CCVs including the top SNP of the region of interest and the SNPs with p-values of association within two orders of magnitude of the top SNP association.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Then, we sequentially performed logistic regression analyses using all other SNPs in the region, adjusted for the top SNP.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We defined a second set of CCVs which included the most significant SNP after adjusting for the top SNP and the SNPs with p-values within two orders of magnitude of the most significant SNP association.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	This was repeated (conditioning on the previously found most significant SNPs) to define additional sets of CCVs as long as at least one p-value remained <10-6
0	cancers	NA	NA	METHODS	Data from BC tumours and adjacent normal breast tissue were accessed from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Germline SNP genotypes (Affymetrix 6.0 arrays) from individuals of European ancestry were processed and imputed to the 1000 Genomes reference panel (October 2014).

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Complete genotype, RNA-seq and copy number data were available for 679 genetically European patients (78 with adjacent normal tissue).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Further, RNA-seq for normal breast tissue and imputed germline genotype data were available from 80 females from the GTEx Consortium.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Genes with a median expression level of 0 RPKM across samples were removed, and RPKM values of each gene were log2 transformed.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Expression values of samples were quantile normalized.

0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Tumour tissue was also adjusted for copy number variation.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	eQTL analyses were performed using the MatrixEQTL program in R
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Candidate target genes were evaluated by assessing each CCV's potential impact on regulatory or coding features using a computational pipeline, INtegrated expression QUantitative trait and In SIlico prediction of GWAS Targets (INQUISIT).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Briefly, genes were considered as potential targets of candidate causal variants through effects on: (1) distal gene regulation, (2) proximal regulation, or (3) a gene's coding sequence.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We intersected CCV positions with multiple sources of genomic information chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET) in MCF7 cells and genome-wide chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) in HMECs.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	METHODS	We used breast cell line computational enhancer-promoter correlations (PreSTIGE, IM-PET, FANTOM5) breast cell super-enhancer, breast tissue-specific expression variants (eQTL) from multiple independent studies (TCGA (normal breast and breast tumour) and GTEx breast:see eQTL methods), transcription factor and histone modification chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) from the ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics Projects together with the genomic features found to be significantly enriched for all known breast cancer CCVs, gene expression RNA-seq from several breast cancer lines and normal samples (ENCODE) and topologically associated domain (TAD) boundaries from T47D cells (ENCODE).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	To assess the impact of intragenic variants, we evaluated their potential to alter primary protein coding sequence and splicing using Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor using MaxEntScan and dbscSNV modules for splicing alterations based on ada and rf scores.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Nonsense and missense changes were assessed with the REVEL ensemble algorithm, with CCVs displaying REVEL scores >0.5 deemed deleterious
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Each target gene prediction category (distal, promoter or coding) was scored according to different criteria.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Genes predicted to be distally regulated targets of CCVs were awarded points based on physical links (for example ChIA-PET), computational prediction methods, or eQTL associations.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	All CCVs were considered as potentially involved in distal regulation.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Intersection of a putative distal enhancer with genomic features found to be significantly enriched were further upweighted.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Multiple independent interactions were awarded an additional point.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	CCVs in gene proximal regulatory regions were intersected with histone ChIP-Seq peaks characteristic of promoters and assigned to the overlapping transcription start sites (defined as -1.0 kb - +0.1 kb).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Further points were awarded to such genes if there was evidence for eQTL association, while a lack of expression resulted in down-weighting as potential targets.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	Potential coding changes including missense, nonsense and predicted splicing alterations resulted in addition of one point to the encoded gene for each type of change, while lack of expression reduced the score.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	METHODS	We added an additional point for predicted target genes that were also breast cancer drivers (278 genes).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	For each category, scores potentially ranged from 0 to 8 (distal); 0 to 4 (promoter) or 0 to 3 (coding).
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	We converted these scores into 'confidence levels': Level 1 (highest confidence) when distal score > 4, promoter score >=3 or coding score >1; Level 2 when distal score <= 4 and >=1, promoter score = 1 or = 2, coding score = 1; and Level 3 when distal score <1 and >0, promoter score <1 and >0, and coding <1 and >0.
0	NA	NA	NA	METHODS	For genes with multiple scores (for example, predicted as targets from multiple independent risk signals or predicted to be impacted in several categories), we recorded the highest score
