0	NA	glutamate decarboxylase	NA	ABSTRACT	We measured two anti-islet autoantibodies, glutamate decarboxylase (GADA, n = 2,506), insulinoma-associated antigen 2 (IA-2A, n = 2,498), antibodies to the autoimmune thyroid (Graves') disease (AITD) autoantigen thyroid peroxidase (TPOA, n = 8,300), and antibodies against gastric parietal cells (PCA, n = 4,328) that are associated with autoimmune gastritis.

1	NA	TPOA	NA	ABSTRACT	Eleven of 52 non-MHC T1D loci showed evidence of association with at least one autoantibody at a false discovery rate of 16%: 16p11/IL27-IA-2A, 2q24/IFIH1-IA-2A and PCA, 2q32/STAT4-TPOA, 10p15/IL2RA-GADA, 6q15/BACH2-TPOA, 21q22/UBASH3A-TPOA, 1p13/PTPN22-TPOA, 2q33/CTLA4-TPOA, 4q27/IL2/TPOA, 15q14/RASGRP1/TPOA, and 12q24/SH2B3-GADA and TPOA.
1	Graves' disease	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Analysis of the TPOA-associated loci in 2,477 cases with Graves' disease identified two new AITD loci (BACH2 and UBASH3A)
0	autoimmune disease	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Autoantibodies are important markers for autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes and Graves' disease.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	However, little is known about the genetic factors that control their production.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	To improve our understanding of this genetic basis, we measured four autoantibodies in a collection of up to 8,300 type 1 diabetes cases plasma samples.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	We combined these measurements with genome-wide genotype data to conduct four independent genome-wide association studies.
1	NA	FCRL3	NA	ABSTRACT	Two loci showed unequivocal evidence of autoantibody association: the FCRL3 locus and the ABO blood group locus.
1	autoimmune disease	FCRL3	NA	ABSTRACT	Variants in the FCRL3 gene have been previously associated with autoimmune diseases, but such associations have not been reported for ABO blood group genotypes.
0	diabetes	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	In addition, we found extensive overlap between type 1 diabetes and autoantibody loci, and these findings provide new information about the role of these risk variants.
0	autoimmune thyroid disease	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Lastly, we hypothesized that loci associated with thyroid autoantibodies are strong candidates for association with thyroid autoimmune disorders.
0	Graves' disease	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	We confirmed this hypothesis by genotyping these variants in an independent cohort of Graves' disease cases, and we found evidence for two new Graves' disease loci
0	autoimmune disease	NA	NA	INTRO	The presence of circulating antibodies to the body's own antigens, namely autoantibodies, is the major hallmark of autoimmunity, which can progress to the diagnosis of a variety of autoimmune diseases.
0	pancreatic	glutamate decarboxylase	NA	INTRO	Autoantibodies directed to antigens in the pancreatic islets, for example, glutamate decarboxylase (GADA) and islet antigen-2 (IA-2A), are characteristic of type 1 diabetes (T1D).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The dynamics of T1D-associated autoantibodies in T1D patients are complex.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	They are detected prior to clinical diagnosis and often persist several years after diagnosis, but they can also disappear prior to T1D diagnosis, and, in general, decline from the time of diagnosis onwards.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Antibodies are produced by B lymphocytes.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The success of B cell depletion therapies in slowing beta-cell destruction in the mouse animal model and more recently the positive effects of such therapies also reported in a clinical trial, demonstrate that B cells play a role in T1D pathogenesis.
0	autoimmunity of systemic lupus erythematosus	NA	NA	INTRO	However, it is also generally accepted that anti-islet antibodies are not pathogenic themselves, in contrast, for example, to autoantibodies in systemic erythematosus lupus (SLE).
0	hereditary B cell deficiency	NA	NA	INTRO	The report of a T1D patient with a severe hereditary B cell deficiency, and the fact that in animal models of T1D the disease is transferable to healthy recipients by T cells but not by serum, are consistent with this view
0	NA	HLA	NA	INTRO	B cell maturation to autoantibody secreting state requires CD4 T helper cells to recognize human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II molecules bound peptides on the surface of B cells and on other antigen-presenting cells.
0	NA	HLA	NA	INTRO	Concordantly, candidate gene association studies have provided evidence for association of autoantibodies with HLA class II alleles.
0	NA	HLA	NA	INTRO	Outside of these HLA associations, relatively little is known about the genes associated with autoantibody production.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	However, we can hypothesize that there should be some overlap in the genes and their alleles that increase the risk of T1D with those that show association with autoantibody positivity.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	If autoantibody positivity per se is not a primary causal factor we should also observe T1D risk alleles that do not show evidence of association with the antibodies.
0	autoimmune disease	NA	NA	INTRO	We also predict that if a gene variant is associated with autoantibody positivity, then it becomes a strong candidate as a risk locus for the associated autoimmune disease.
1	Graves' disease	BACH2	NA	INTRO	In the present report we illustrate that this strategy is successful with the identification of two new candidate genes for Graves' disease susceptibility, BACH2 and UBASH3A
0	NA	glutamate decarboxylase	NA	INTRO	To investigate the genes involved in autoantibody production, we measured two T1D-associated anti-islet autoantibodies: glutamate decarboxylase (GADA, n = 2,506) and insulinoma-associated antigen 2 (IA-2A, n = 2,498) in plasma samples from T1D cases.
0	Graves' disease	thyrotropin receptor	NA	INTRO	In contrast with T1D, Graves' disease is known to be mediated by autoantibodies against the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR), which leads to hypothyroidism.
0	Graves' disease	TPOA	NA	INTRO	However, thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies (TPOA), which are detected in 75% of Graves' disease patients, are a sensitive and specific predictor of the disease.
0	Hashimoto's thyroiditis	TPOA	NA	INTRO	TPOA are also correlated with anti-TSHR autoantibodies and Hashimoto's thyroiditis.
0	Graves' disease	TPOA	NA	INTRO	This direct role of anti-TSHR antibodies in Graves' disease aetiology motivated the measurement, in the same collection of T1D cases, of TPOA (n = 8,300), which was an assay available at a significantly lower cost than the anti-TSHR autoantibody test.
0	autoimmune gastritis	NA	NA	INTRO	To further extend this analysis, we also measured autoantibodies directed against parietal cells (PCA, n = 4,328), a biomarker for autoimmune gastritis and pernicious anaemia.
0	anaemia	NA	NA	INTRO	Eighty-six percent of pernicious anaemia patients are estimated to be PCA positive
0	NA	glutamate decarboxylase	NA	INTRO	We combined these four autoantibody measurements (GADA, IA-2A, PCA and TPOA) with available genome-wide genotype data to carry out four distinct genome-wide association (GWA) scans for autoantibody positivity.
1	autoimmune disease	HLA	NA	INTRO	Outside of the HLA region, we discovered the association of several genes with autoantibody positivity, including evidence for association of the ABO blood gene with autoimmunity and also, surprisingly, a strong association of the known autoimmunity gene, FCRL3, with IA-2A, but not with T1D.
0	diabetes	HLA	NA	INTRO	Associations with variants in the HLA region are the subject of a separate paper (Howson et al., Diabetes)
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	In the 8,506 T1D samples the median age at venepuncture was 13 years, the median age at T1D diagnosis was 8 years and the median time between T1D diagnosis and venepuncture was 5 years.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Thirty percent of the blood samples were taken within two years.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The distribution of the four antibody measurements is shown in Figure S1.
0	NA	glutamate decarboxylase	NA	RESULTS	GADA and IA-2A -seropositive cases were at 50% and 59%, respectively (Table 1).
0	NA	glutamate decarboxylase	NA	RESULTS	Consistent with previous reports, time since diagnosis is negatively correlated with GADA and IA-2A positivity (Table 1), perhaps reflecting declining levels of beta-cell antigens and immuno-inflammatory activity following diagnosis.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We, therefore, included time since diagnosis (or disease duration) as a covariate in all statistical analysis.
0	NA	glutamate decarboxylase	NA	RESULTS	After controlling for time since diagnosis, early-onset T1D cases had lower frequencies of GADA and IA-2A (Table 1)
0	NA	TPOA	NA	RESULTS	PCA and TPOA frequencies in the T1D samples were 10% and 12%, respectively (Table 1).
0	NA	TPOA	NA	RESULTS	Age has been shown to have a major effect on TPOA frequency.
0	NA	TPOA	NA	RESULTS	In our study, time since T1D diagnosis is positively correlated with PCA and TPOA positivity (Table 1), but because this covariate is strongly correlated with age at venepuncture (correlation coefficient 0.85), this observation is most likely a consequence of age.
0	autoimmune disease	glutamate decarboxylase	NA	RESULTS	PCA, GADA and TPOA frequencies were higher in women, a result consistent with previous reports of elevated frequency of autoimmune diseases in women.
0	NA	TPOA	NA	RESULTS	Lastly, and after controlling for other covariates, significant positive correlations were observed between PCA and TPOA, and between TPOA and GADA (Table 1)
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We found two (non-MHC) associations using a genome-wide significance threshold of, p = 5x10-8.
0	NA	FCRL1	rs4971154	RESULTS	Firstly, we associated rs4971154 on chromosome 1q23 in exon 5 of the immune-regulatory receptor gene FCRL1 with IA-2A (p = 2.9x10-11, estimated odds ratio (OR) = 0.66 for the minor allele C, Table 2).
1	autoimmune disease	FCRL3	rs7528684	RESULTS	Three other loci in this chromosome region have been associated with autoantibody and/or autoimmune diseases: rs7528684, located in the promoter region of the FCRL3 gene, was associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and SLE risk, as well as frequency of cyclic citrullinated peptide autoantibodies (CCPA) in Japanese RA patients.
1	Graves' disease	FCRL3	rs11264798	RESULTS	rs11264798 located in intron 8 of FCRL3, and rs10489678 in FCRL5, have been previously associated with Graves' disease
1	Graves' disease	TPOA	rs4971154	RESULTS	To understand the relationship between the TPOA, IA-2A, T1D and Graves' disease associations at the 1q23 locus, we genotyped rs4971154, rs7528684, rs11264798 and rs10489678 in the full T1D case-control collection (up to 10,596 controls and 8,506 T1D cases), as well as in 2,477 Graves' disease patients (the same cohort that was used in).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We used stepwise logistic regression to select the most associated SNP for each of the four traits.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The alleles, minor allele frequencies and pairwise measures of LD are shown in Table S1.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Association results for these SNPs with IA-2A and T1D are shown in Table 3.
0	NA	TPOA	NA	RESULTS	TPOA and Graves' results are shown in Table 4
1	NA	FCRL3	rs7528684	RESULTS	We found that the IA-2A association in T1D cases was fully accounted for by the FCRL3 SNP rs7528684 (p = 8.3x10-12, OR = 0.65 for the minor allele C, Table 3), which added to other single SNP models in the stepwise regression (p<0.01).
1	NA	NA	rs7528684	RESULTS	rs7528684 was denoted as 169C T in, where Kochi et al.
1	rheumatoid arthritis	FCRL3	NA	RESULTS	reported that the RA and SLE risk allele rs7528684-C was also associated with increased FCRL3 expression and higher CCPA frequency in RA patients.
1	NA	NA	rs7528684	RESULTS	In our European sample sets, the minor allele of rs7528684 is C and was strongly negatively associated with IA-2A positivity, a direction of effect opposed to the previously reported CCPA result.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We checked this result thoroughly by resequencing both alleles in four selected samples and verified the initial data (Y. Kochi, personal communication), but found no errors.
1	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We also replicated the IA-2A/rs7528684 in 3,897 affected siblings from multiplex families (Methods) and found consistent evidence of IA-2A negative association (p = 7.6x10-9, OR = 0.69)
0	Graves' disease	TPOA	rs11264798	RESULTS	The TPOA and Graves' disease associations showed the same pattern of association, whereby a single (although different) SNP, rs11264798, alone explained both associations (p = 3.5x10-4 for TPOA and p = 1.7x10-3 for Graves' disease, Table 4).
0	NA	NA	rs11264798	RESULTS	The SNP rs11264798 added to other single SNP models in a stepwise regression (p<0.01).
0	NA	TPOA	NA	RESULTS	The discrepancy between the TPOA and IA-2A results suggests that the causal variants underlying these two associations are distinct.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We confirmed this hypothesis using a formal statistical test (p = 0.004 against the null hypothesis of a single causal variant)
1	NA	NA	rs7528684	RESULTS	In contrast with the IA-2A and TPOA/Graves' disease result, there was no evidence for T1D case-control association in this region: p = 0.09 for rs7528684 and p = 0.06 for rs11264798 in 10,010 controls and 8,327 T1D cases, estimated OR = 0.97 and 1.04, respectively, for the minor alleles (Table 3).
1	NA	NA	rs7528684	RESULTS	To evaluate this result further we genotyped both SNPs in a set of 8,038 T1D trios (3,598 multiplex families, see Methods), obtaining weak evidence of T1D association (p = 0.026 for rs7528684 and p = 0.04 for rs11264798, with relative risks 0.95 and 1.04, respectively).
1	NA	NA	rs7528684	RESULTS	Taken together, these data suggest that the minor allele C of rs7528684 is very weakly protective for T1D (combined p = 0.0013, OR = 0.95) and the minor allele C of rs11264798 increases T1D risk very slightly (combined p = 0.0014, OR 1.04).
1	NA	TPOA	NA	RESULTS	The rs11264798-C minor allele is protective for TPOA, but is also in LD with the rs7528684-T major allele associated with IA-2A positivity
1	NA	ABO blood group	rs657152	RESULTS	PCA positivity was associated with rs657152 (G>T) on chromosome 9q34, in intron 1 of the blood group gene ABO (p = 1.15x10-13, OR = 0.35 for the minor allele T, Table 2).
1	NA	ABO blood group	NA	RESULTS	rs657152-G is a marker for the ABO blood group O in Caucasian individuals (using blood group frequency estimates based on rs6872889 in, which is a proxy for rs657152, HapMap r2 = 0.93).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We found a departure from the linear trend test assumption for this SNP (p = 0.02 when we compared a 2 degree-of-freedom genotype effect model to the standard 1 degree-of-freedom linear trend test).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Taking the most common genotype GG as reference the estimated odds ratios were 0.26 for GT (95% CI: 0.17-0.39) and 0.23 for TT (95% CI: 0.11-0.49).
1	NA	ABO blood group	NA	RESULTS	Therefore in this dataset the observed PCA association is essentially a consequence of the elevated PCA frequency in the GG genotype group, which is closely correlated to the ABO blood group O
0	gastric ulcer	E-selectin	NA	RESULTS	The major allele G at this SNP, associated with higher PCA frequency in T1D cases, has also been associated with multiple traits including higher circulating levels of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (sICAM-1,) and E-selectin, higher gastric ulcer risk and lower pancreatic cancer risk, indicating that this blood group determinant enzyme has pleiotropic effects.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We found no association of this SNP with T1D (p = 0.268 in 7,240 controls and 5,817 T1D cases).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We investigated whether other sICAM associated SNPs in a different chromosome region (19p13,) showed association with PCA (Table S2), but found no evidence supporting this
1	NA	FUT2	NA	RESULTS	At the FUT2 gene locus, the A allele of rs601338A>G (X143W/se428) prevents the secretion of ABO antigens in the gut and in saliva.
0	Crohn's disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	The homozygous genotype AA has recently been associated with susceptibility for Crohn's disease and to T1D (DJS, JMMH, JAT, unpublished, www.t1dbase.org).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We therefore tested a potential PCA association with this SNP.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We found unconvincing evidence of PCA association: p = 0.077 linear trend test in 437 PCA positive and 3,697 PCA negative samples, estimated OR = 0.88 (95% CI: 0.77-1.01) for the G allele.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Taking the AA non-secretor group as reference, a genotype association analysis suggests that the estimated ORs are not significantly different for the AG (OR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.64-1.01) and GG (OR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.796-1.05) genotype groups.
0	Crohn's disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	Therefore, while the evidence is unconvincing for PCA, this recessive model of increased risk for non-secretor AA genotype group is consistent with the T1D and Crohn disease associations
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We then used additional genotyping data in the full T1D case collection to investigate autoantibody associations at 64 known T1D-associated SNPs in 52 distinct chromosome regions (, www.t1dbase.org).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Owing to higher prior belief that these SNPs are autoantibody associated we used a less stringent threshold (p<=0.01) corresponding here to a false discovery rate of 16% (Benjamini-Hochberg estimation procedure).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We identified 13 independent associations, which included two SNPs associated with two distinct autoantibodies each (Table 5).
1	NA	TPOA	rs11755527	RESULTS	The most significant finding was the TPOA association with the BACH2 T1D-associated SNP rs11755527 (C>G, p = 9.7x10-7, OR = 1.27).
0	NA	TPOA	NA	RESULTS	Eight out of these 13 associations involved TPOA.
1	NA	TPOA	NA	RESULTS	The association of TPOA with CTLA4 in T1D cases has been reported previously, and here, we extend support for this finding.
1	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We did not replicate a previously published GADA/PTPN22 interaction.
0	NA	glutamate decarboxylase	NA	RESULTS	We also did not obtain evidence of association with any of the autoantibodies (p>0.05), including IA-2A and GADA, with INS, which shows the strongest association with T1D outside of the MHC region
1	NA	IL27	rs4788084	RESULTS	To replicate both IA-2A associations in an independent collection, we genotyped the IL27 SNP rs4788084 and IFIH1 SNP rs1990760 in the 3,897 T1DGC affected sibling samples with IA-2A data (Methods).
1	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Both SNPs convincingly replicated the initial IA-2A results: two-tailed p = 0.0074, 8.4x10-4 for IFIH1/rs1990760, IL27/rs4788084, respectively, with the direction of effect consistent in both cases with the initial finding (estimated OR = 1.13 for IFIH1 and 1.17 for IL27)
1	Graves' disease	TPOA	NA	RESULTS	TPOA are commonly detected in Graves' disease patients and, therefore, the TPOA- associated SNPs located in the genes RASGRP1, UBASH3A and BACH2 that have not been previously tested for Graves' disease association are strong Graves' disease candidates.
0	Graves' disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	To investigate this hypothesis we genotyped these three SNPs in 2,477 Graves' disease cases (Table 4).
1	NA	UBASH3A	C for 48	RESULTS	We obtained p = 2.4x10-4, OR = 1.14 for the UBASH3A C>A SNP rs3788013 and p = 6.2x10-3, OR = 1.11 for the BACH2 C>G SNP rs11755527.
0	Graves' disease	TPOA	NA	RESULTS	For both SNPs the minor allele is the risk allele for Graves' disease and T1D and was associated with higher positivity for TPOA.
1	Graves' disease	RASGRP1	rs7171171	RESULTS	No evidence of Graves' disease association was found for rs7171171 in RASGRP1 (p>0.05)
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Given the positive findings in T1D associated loci we extended our analysis to 135 SNPs in 100 autoimmune-associated loci.
0	NA	TPOA	NA	RESULTS	Each SNP was tested for association with TPOA, GADA, PCA and IA-2A using p<=0.01 as a threshold (false discovery rate of 27%, Table S3).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We found five additional associations: 2q37/PDCD1-IA-2A, 3p14.3/PXK-GADA, 5q33.3/IL12B-TPOA, 12q12/LRRK2-TPOA, 12q24.31/SPPL3-TPOA.
0	Graves' disease	TPOA	NA	RESULTS	We genotyped the full T1D case-control collection as well as the set of Graves' disease cases to validate the three TPOA findings, but none of them replicated for TPOA, or provided convincing evidence of Graves' disease or T1D association (p>0.05)
0	Graves' disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The combination of genome-wide genotyping data with autoantibody measurements and case-control data for T1D and Graves' disease has enabled the discovery of several new genetic associations with autoantibody positivity and disease traits.
1	NA	FCRL3	NA	DISCUSS	We conclude that the nine loci (FCRL3, RASGRP1, SH2B3, STAT4, BACH2, UBASH3A, IL2, PTPN22, and CTLA4) associated with TPOA, which is not a T1D anti-islet autoantibody, may have general effects in adaptive immunity, in the complex interactions between antigen presenting cells and T cells leading to antibody-producing plasma B cells.
1	autoimmune disease	TPOA	rs2069762	DISCUSS	Consistent with this general role in autoimmunity, six out of nine TPOA loci were associated with Graves' disease (except rs2069762 in IL2, rs3184504 in SH2B3 and rs7171171 in RASGRP, Table 5), including both newly identified Graves' disease loci BACH2 and UBASH3A.
0	Graves' disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	For these six TPOA/Graves' disease-associated SNPs, the Graves' disease risk allele is also the one associated with elevated frequency of TPOA.
1	NA	TPOA	NA	DISCUSS	Lastly, four of the nine TPOA associated SNPs (in SH2B3, CTLA4, BACH2 and UBASH3A) have also been associated with celiac disease (but not the SNPs in RASGRP1, STAT4, PTPN22, IL2  and FCRL3 ).
0	Graves' disease	TPOA	NA	DISCUSS	We note that the Graves' disease associated thyroglobulin (TG) gene region, was not associated with TPOA (p>0.01 at all SNPs within 300 kb of the TG gene).
0	Graves' disease	thyrotropin receptor	NA	DISCUSS	To further understand the association of genes with autoantibodies in T1D and in Graves' disease the measurement of TSHR autoantibodies will be informative
0	NA	glutamate decarboxylase	NA	DISCUSS	After controlling for time since diagnosis we found that the patients' age at T1D diagnosis was positively correlated with the presence of GADA and IA-2A, such that patients diagnosed at a younger age are less likely to be IA-2A or GADA positive.
0	NA	glutamate decarboxylase	NA	DISCUSS	This result is consistent with other studies that found that GADA positivity was associated with older age at diagnosis.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our finding suggests that earlier onset T1D involves pathogenesis directed towards autoantigens other than GADA/IA-2A, and/or beta-cell destruction is so profound in these children that they lose their autoantibodies very rapidly owing to extensive removal of islet antigens following T1D onset
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Owing to the fact that the plasma samples in this study were collected a median time of five years following diagnosis, with 30% within 2 years of diagnosis, we cannot exclude the possibility that the same GWA conducted using autoantibody data closer or prior to T1D onset might yield different results.
0	NA	glutamate decarboxylase	NA	DISCUSS	Nevertheless, the prevalences of GADA and IA-2A in our study (Table 1) are consistent with previously reported measurements in paediatric patients at T1D diagnosis.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The misclassification of autoantibody status in T1D cases may lower the statistical power but it is highly unlikely to generate false positive genetic associations.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Hence, the convincing association results identified in this study (Table 2, Table 3, Table 4, Table 5) indicate that these measurements are valid
0	NA	TPOA	NA	DISCUSS	Our estimated TPOA frequencies are consistent with a recent large scale study which found 8.8% of T1D children aged less than 12 years to be TPOA positive.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, the strong effect of age, and the use in other studies of different assays with variable sensitivity, complicates a comparison of autoantibody frequency with healthy control groups.
0	NA	TPOA	NA	DISCUSS	A previous study found 2.6% of Finnish school children and 0.4% of Russian school children to be TPOA positive but another Swedish study found 11.3% of 12 year old children to be TPOA positive.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our frequency of PCA positivity in plasma samples from T1D cases of 10% is comparable to previous reports of PCA frequencies in T1D diagnosed under age 30 years (9% in), but higher in that the 2.2% in population controls aged 21-30 years
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Among the four autoantibodies we considered, the absence of correlations between IA-2A and GADA/PCA/TPOA (Table 1) suggests the involvement of distinct genes and pathways for IA-2A.
1	NA	IFIH1	NA	DISCUSS	Moreover, for the T1D-associated SNPs located in IFIH1 and IL27, the T1D risk allele is associated with reduced IA-2A positivity (Table 5).
1	NA	NA	rs7171171	DISCUSS	This result is different from the TPOA/T1D associations for which, in six out of eight cases, the T1D risk allele is also the allele associated with increased TPOA positivity (rs7171171 in RASGRP1 and rs2069762 in IL2 being the exceptions, see Table 5).
0	diabetes	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This pattern has been reported previously between IA-2A and the T1D associated HLA-A*24 allele and confirmed by our recent analyses (JMMH, JAT, Diabetes)
1	autoimmunity of systemic lupus erythematosus	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The 1q23/FCRL3 association data highlight the complexity of this autoimmune locus, which has previously been associated with SLE, RA and Graves' disease.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our results show that two distinct associations co-localize in this chromosome region.
1	autoimmunity of systemic lupus erythematosus	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Firstly, the SNP rs7528684-C is associated with SLE and RA risk, CCPA positivity in RA patients, but is negatively associated with IA-2A positivity in T1D.
1	autoimmune disease	PTPN22	NA	DISCUSS	These associations, which are in opposite directions for IA-2A compared to the other autoimmune traits, contrast with the consistency observed for the PTPN22 and CTLA4 variants, for which the risk allele is consistently the same across multiple autoimmune diseases (in particular Graves' disease, T1D and TPOA in T1D patients, see Table 4).
0	Graves' disease	TPOA	NA	DISCUSS	Secondly, the SNP rs11264798-G is independently associated with Graves' disease, as well as with TPOA positivity in T1D patients.
0	NA	TPOA	NA	DISCUSS	The three autoantibody associations in this chromosome region (with CCPA, IA-2A and TPOA) indicate that this locus is involved in the breakdown of self-tolerance and autoantibody production.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	On the other hand, the effect on T1D risk is not strong (combined case-control and family p = 0.001).
0	autoimmune disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Owing to the involvement of this region in multiple autoimmune disorders the prior belief that this locus is T1D associated is high.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Therefore, the T1D association result could be real, but the effect size very small (estimated odds ratio 1.05).
1	NA	NA	rs7528684	DISCUSS	One explanation for these highly significant results in terms of IA-2A association is that the autoimmune disease-associated allele, C (of SNP rs7528684) is affecting anti-IA-2A T cells responses in a different way to autoantibody responses to this antigen.
1	NA	FCRL3	NA	DISCUSS	The FCRL3 molecule could be affecting T regulatory cell development or function
1	NA	ABO blood group	NA	DISCUSS	The ABO gene encodes a glycosyltransferase which is expressed in multiple human tissues.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	It could affect glycosylation, and therefore function or antigenicity of a wide range of molecules, in particular parietal cells antigens in the gastro-intestinal mucosal lining.
0	gastric ulcer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This blood group O, associated with increased PCA frequency, is also associated with increased frequency of gastric ulcers, a condition frequently caused by long-standing Helicobacter pylori infection.
1	NA	ABO blood group	NA	DISCUSS	ABO blood groups are not associated with the presence of H. pylori  but the blood group O has been associated with increased inflammatory response to this bacterium.
1	Inflammation Laboratory's JDRF	NA	NA	DISCUSS	A plausible hypothesis for the ABO-PCA association is that the inflammation caused by H. pylori can not only result in gastric ulcers, but can also initiate an autoimmune reaction directed against parietal cells.
1	anaemia	ABO blood group	NA	DISCUSS	However, previous reports do not support an increased pernicious anaemia risk for individuals with the ABO blood group O, which indicates that the role of ABO in progression from PCA to pernicious anaemia is not straightforward
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Finally, we note that the majority of T1D regions did not associate with autoantibody positivity.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Many of these chromosome regions contain genes of unknown function with no obvious candidate genes.
1	NA	interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain	NA	DISCUSS	It will be informative to continue to compare genetic associations from other diseases and traits (such as autoantibodies analysed here and other serum analytes, such as soluble CD25), to identify which of these newly-mapped, unexplored T1D loci are involved in certain pathways.
1	NA	SH2B3	NA	DISCUSS	Our current results place the candidate genes SH2B3, CTLA4, BACH2 and UBASH3A at the very heart of the immune response in the pathogenesis of both T1D and celiac disease
