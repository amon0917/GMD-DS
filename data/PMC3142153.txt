0	Type 2 diabetes	insulin	NA	INTRO	Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex disease hallmarked by insulin resistance and pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	T2D is becoming a major concern of global public health due to its escalating prevalence throughout the world.
0	prediabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	In China, 9.7% and 15.5% of the entire population suffer from T2D and prediabetes, respectively.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Although overfeeding and sedentary lifestyle are claimed as the main contributors to its increasing incidence, genetic factors play a significant role in the etiology and pathogenesis of T2D, in many cases via interaction with environmental counterparts
0	obese	NA	NA	INTRO	Genetic analysis of T2D and related diseases (such as obesity and monogenic diabetes) and traits (such as fasting plasma glucose levels) has greatly improved our understanding of glucose homeostasis and energy balance in both physiological and pathological conditions, some of which has brought novel preventive and therapeutic options.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Before the year 2007, studies based on linkage analysis and candidate gene strategy identified only a few genetic loci of T2D.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	More recently, several genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been completed in independent population samples derived from Caucasians and Japanese, and identified a host of novel susceptibility loci of T2D.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	With a more recent large-scale meta-analysis taking into account, these studies in total have discovered at least 38 independent susceptibility loci of T2D, many of which have been replicated in populations of different ancestries, including Han Chinese
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Extending GWAS to populations of diverse descents is valuable, because different frequencies of genetic variants and patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) due to population backgrounds may strongly affect the power and potential of GWAS to discover and/or refine certain genetic loci associated with disease.
0	insufficient	KCNQ1	NA	INTRO	For example, association of KCNQ1 with T2D was first independently identified by two GWASs in Japanese, although for both studies the sample size of the discovery stage was small and the genomic coverage of SNPs insufficiently dense.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	However, to date, original data of GWAS of T2D in Han Chinese is still limited.
0	NA	PTPRD	NA	INTRO	One study was conducted among Han Chinese in Taiwan that identified two additional novel loci in the protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type D (PTPRD) and serine racemase (SRR) genes.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	The other was performed in women from Shanghai Women's Health Study (SWHS) and Shanghai Breast Cancer Study (SBCS).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Here, we reported a 2-stage study, comprising one discovery and one replication stage, in both Han Chinese men and women residing in Mainland China
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	In the discovery stage, 998 T2D patients of Han Chinese descent recruited in Shanghai were genotyped using Illumina Human 660-Quad BeadChips.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Our control population was derived from a glucose survey in a community in Shanghai and was genotyped using Illumina Human 660- and 610-Quad BeadChips.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	After stringent quality control, we obtained 561,694 SNPs that were common to both genotyping platforms with both average call rates of >99%.
0	MDS	NA	NA	RESULTS	To ensure that case and control groups were genetically matched, in addition to close examination of their geographic origins, MDS was used to exclude population outliers, the result of which was further confirmed by PCA, which showed minimal evidence for population stratification [Figure S1, Figure S2].
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	474,515 SNPs in 793 cases and 806 controls entered final statistical analysis using the Cochran-Armitage trend test to examine the genotype-phenotype association under an additive model.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	After genomic control (GC) with an inflation factor lambda of 1.08 [Figure S3], the association results did not change significantly
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We selected the top 30 significantly associated SNPs representing 15 genomic regions in the discovery stage (arbitrarily defined as trend-P <=10-4) for genotyping in an independent case-control population from Shanghai (n = 2620) (1058 cases and 1562 controls, part of Replication 1) as a fast-track replication analysis [Table S1, Figure S4].
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Among the 30 SNPs, 3 representing 2 genomic loci were replicated with the same direction of association with the discovery stage at the significance level of P<0.10 (Figure 1).
1	NA	KCNQ1	rs163182	RESULTS	Two of them, namely rs163182 and rs163184 (P = 2.348x10-7, OR = 1.37, and P = 0.04332, OR = 1.121, respectively), were located in the same locus in gene KCNQ1 as previously reported.
0	NA	NA	rs3773159	RESULTS	The remaining SNP, rs3773159 (P = 0.09591, OR = 1.152), is likely to represent a novel susceptibility locus for T2D in the population

0	NA	NA	rs3773159	RESULTS	We genotyped the rest of replication 1 (1602 cases and 506 controls residing in Shanghai and Jiangsu Province) and pooled analysis (Replication 1: 2660 cases and 2068 controls) showed a nominally significant association of rs3773159 with T2D (P = 0.0418, OR = 1.137, Table 1).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Further genotyping and analysis in an independent sample comprising 1785 cases and 2390 controls (Replication 2: Southern Han) identified a consistent association though without reaching significance level.
0	NA	NA	rs3773159	RESULTS	Therefore, there was not enough evidence to establish the association of rs3773159 with T2D in out populations
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We checked a total of 37 genomic loci previously reported to be associated with T2D in our discovery stage data, among which 42 SNPs in 26 loci were successfully genotyped.
0	NA	NOTCH2	rs2793831	RESULTS	13 SNPs representing 9 loci were significantly associated with T2D in our GWAS at a significant level of P<0.05 (Table S2): rs2793831 (proxy for rs10923931, NOTCH2), rs2943641 (IRS1), rs2120825 (proxy for rs1801282, PPARG), rs734312 (WFS1), rs896854 (TP53INP1), rs10906115 (CDC123/CAMK1D), rs7901695 (TCF7L2), rs7903146 (TCF7L2), rs1552224 (CENTD2), rs1370176 (C2CD4A/B), rs1436953 (C2CD4A/B), rs7172432 (C2CD4A/B), and rs1436955 (C2CD4B).
0	NA	HHEX	rs1111875	RESULTS	If we adopt a less stringent threshold of P<0.10, 4 more SNPs representing 3 genomic regions showed significant association with T2D in the discovery stage (Table S2): rs1111875 (HHEX), rs7923837 (HHEX), rs8050136 (FTO), and rs780094 (GCKR)
0	NA	NA	rs1370176	RESULTS	We noticed that the three SNPs - rs1370176, rs1436953, and rs7172432 in C2CD4A/B on chromosome 15 - were exactly the lead SNPs in a three-stage GWAS recently reported involving a total of ~19000 Japanese.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Further genotyping in the fast-track replication sample showed that the three SNPs tended to be consistently associated with T2D (P = 0.1134, 0.03651, and 0.01884, respectively).
0	NA	NA	rs1370176	RESULTS	Genotyping in the remaining 1602 cases and 506 controls of Replication 1 and pooled analysis (Replication 1) expectedly rendered these associations significant (rs1370176, P = 0.03597, OR = 1.115; rs1436953, P = 9.671x10-5, OR = 1.187; rs7172432, P = 4.529x10-4, OR = 1.187, respectively; Table 1).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Further analysis in the Southern Han population (Replication 2) showed that the associations were in the same direction as those in Central Han population but did not reach significance level (Table 1, Figure 1)
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our GWAS did not provide sufficient evidence for potentially novel genetic variation associated with T2D in Han Chinese.
0	NA	KCNQ1	NA	DISCUSS	However, our study validated 10 previously reported loci associated with T2D, including KCNQ1 and C2CD4A/B, and several of which were very recently discovered by large-scale multistage study and meta-analyses
1	NA	NA	rs163182	DISCUSS	In Han Chinese population, our study validated previously known susceptibility loci of T2D, among which SNPs in KCNQ1were consistently and most strongly associated with T2D (rs163182, Pcombined = 2.085x10-17, OR = 1.280).
0	NA	KCNQ1	rs163184	DISCUSS	rs163184, the SNP most significantly associated with T2D in KCNQ1 in our discovery stage, is also the lead SNP in two other independent studies.
0	NA	NA	rs2237892	DISCUSS	One additional SNP in the same locus, namely rs2237892, was reported to be significantly associated with T2D in two independent studies in Japanese, and replicated in our previous study.
0	NA	KCNQ1	NA	DISCUSS	Collectively, these data confirmed that variants in KCNQ1 were associated with T2D in different populations, and our GWAS worked in identifying such variants
0	NA	KCNQ1	NA	DISCUSS	Aside from variants in KCNQ1, our study rediscovered several SNPs in additional susceptibility loci of T2D originally identified in populations of different ancestries, and SNPs in three such loci came to our notice.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The first is C2CD4A/B in 15q21.3, which was quite recently reported by a GWAS of T2D involving about 8000 Japanese in their discovery stage.
0	NA	NA	rs7172432	DISCUSS	The most significant SNP reported, rs7172432, was also most strongly associated with T2D at the locus in the Han Chinese population (PGWAS = 3.264x10-4), but did not reach the cutoff P = 10-4, mainly due to our limited power because of small sample size.
0	NA	NA	rs1370176	DISCUSS	Two more SNPs reported, namely rs1370176 and rs1436953, were in the same locus and associated with T2D in our GWAS.
0	NA	NA	rs1436955	DISCUSS	We noticed that another recent work reported an association of rs1436955 with T2D in Han Chinese, which was indeed in the same locus; albeit in silico replication strategy might have prevented their further analysis.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Although not replicated in Southern Han population possibly due to population reasons, the 3 SNPs were significantly associated with T2D in Central Han population, with risk alleles having slightly stronger effect sizes (OR = 1.115-1.187) than those in Japanese population as previously reported.
0	NA	C2CD4A	NA	DISCUSS	These results present direct evidence that genetic variants in C2CD4A/B locus are associated with T2D in Central Han Chinese population residing in Mainland China.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Further studies are required to investigate whether such associations exist in Southern and Northern Han Chinese populations and identify the causal variants
0	NA	TP53INP1	rs896854	DISCUSS	The other two loci are TP53INP1 (rs896854, PGWAS = 0.002212) and CENTD2 (rs1552224, PGWAS = 0.04226); both of them were discovered in a large-scale meta-analysis comprising more than one hundred thousand individuals of European descent (DIAGRAM+).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our GWAS was likely to validate these two newly identified loci in the Han Chinese population, but further replication is required to examine their effects.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Moreover, in light of the small sample size of our GWAS stage, these results support the notion that GWAS in Han Chinese has potential to identify novel risk loci of T2D
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Our study represents the first GWAS with both discovery and replication sample sets recruited both Han Chinese men and women residing in Mainland China.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Han Chinese is geographically and genetically heterogeneous and has subpopulation structures, which may have considerable effect on design and interpretation of GWAS.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Allele effects in Southern Han Chinese were consistently weaker than those in Central Han Chinese (Table 1); we consider this as a result of different population backgrounds.
0	autoimmune disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Because T2D-associated variants show much weaker effects than alleles associated with other diseases and traits (e.g., autoimmune disease and malignancies), a much larger sample consisting of homogenous individuals is required for genuine associations to achieve genome-wide significance.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Though our initial sample size is small, which might have prevented us to discover more potentially novel associations, our GWAS has successfully replicated 10 previously reported T2D susceptibility loci, several of which are very recently discovered by large-scale studies and meta-analyses in Caucasians and Japanese.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This fact lends convincing evidence of the soundness of our study, and highlights the potential of discovering novel genetic variations associated with T2D by extending GWAS to diverse populations
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In conclusion, our genome-wide association study confirmed several T2D susceptibility loci previously identified in Caucasians and Japanese, among which variants in KCNQ1showed the strongest association, and variants in C2CD4A/B were first replicated in Han Chinese residing in Mainland China
