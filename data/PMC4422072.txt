1	Breast and prostate cancer	RASA1	rs35148638	ABSTRACT	In a multistage, case-only genome-wide association study of 12,518 prostate cancer cases, we identify two loci associated with Gleason score, a pathological measure of disease aggressiveness: rs35148638 at 5q14.3 (RASA1, P=6.49x10-9) and rs78943174 at 3q26.31 (NAALADL2, P=4.18x10-8).
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	In a stratified case-control analysis, the SNP at 5q14.3 appears specific for aggressive prostate cancer (P=8.85x10-5) with no association for non-aggressive prostate cancer compared to controls (P=0.57).

0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Prostate cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in men and second leading cause of cancer death among men in the U.S.; however, little is known about why the disease progresses in some men but not others.
0	cancers	NA	NA	INTRO	Determining which cancers are likely to progress and cause death is of critical clinical importance.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Prostate cancer aggressiveness is thought to be partially determined by genetic factors, as studies have shown an increased risk of death from prostate cancer among offspring with a family history of fatal disease.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	The definitions of aggressive prostate cancer differ between studies, but one important and widely used descriptor is tumor grade at diagnosis, as measured by Gleason score, which ranks pathological changes, namely, tumor differentiation, and has been associated with disease progression and survival.
0	aggressive disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Linkage studies using Gleason score as a measure of aggressiveness have implicated several chromosomal regions, including 1p, 5q, 6q, 7q, and 19q, but no specific genetic mutations have been conclusively identified.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Although previous genetic association studies have identified or suggested markers for aggressive prostate cancer; these SNPs have either also been associated with non-aggressive disease, making them non-specific, or have not been convincingly replicated
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified roughly 100 loci associated with prostate cancer risk; however, most loci have minor allele frequencies >10%, and so far, none conclusively differentiate aggressive from non-aggressive disease.
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	To discover additional loci associated with risk and to identify loci specific for aggressive prostate cancer, here we conduct a multistage GWAS for prostate cancer among men of European ancestry using the Illumina HumanOmni2.5 Beadchip, which provides greater coverage of uncommon SNPs for individuals of European ancestry than microarrays used in previous GWAS of prostate cancer
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	We identify two novel loci associated with Gleason score, a pathological measure of prostate cancer aggressiveness, that are located near genes involved vascular development and maintenance

0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	RESULTS	The SNPs at chromosome 5q14.3 and 3q26.31 represent novel loci (Figure 1), whereas the chromosome 19q13.33 locus has been previously identified to be associated with prostate cancer risk overall
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	RESULTS	To evaluate the extent to which these three loci (identified from our case-only study of Gleason score) could be associated with aggressive prostate cancer risk, we conducted a case-control analysis stratified by overall Gleason score (e.g., 2 to 10), recognizing that our power to detect an association at genome-wide significance would be reduced.
0	aggressive disease	NA	NA	RESULTS	We did not have data on the individual components of Gleason 7 from most studies in order to sub-classify them as 3+4 or 4+3, and so in order to clearly differentiate between aggressive and non-aggressive disease, we stratified our cases by those with Gleason scores <= 6 (non-aggressive) and those with Gleason >= 8 (aggressive).

1	aggressive disease	NA	rs78943174	RESULTS	As rs78943174 at 3q26.31 was not common among controls with a minor allele frequency of 1-2%, we had limited power to detect an association with aggressive disease; however, we did observe a marginal positive association between rs78943174 and aggressive prostate cancer risk (P=0.07) and the p-value for heterogeneity between aggressive and non-aggressive prostate cancer risk was nominally significant (P=0.006).
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	RESULTS	Consistent with previous studies, the SNP at 19q13.33 was strongly associated with non-aggressive prostate cancer (P = 3.51 x 10-13) with a weak association in the opposite direction for aggressive prostate cancer (P = 0.01) and highly significant p-value for heterogeneity (P=1.44 x 10-10)
0	Breast and prostate cancer	NA	NA	RESULTS	As African Americans have an elevated risk of prostate cancer, we evaluated the extent to which these three SNPs were associated with aggressive prostate cancer risk in African Americans using data from the African American Prostate Cancer (AAPC) GWAS Consortium (see Methods).
1	aggressive disease	NA	rs62113212	RESULTS	In this smaller study, none of the SNPs were significantly associated with the risk of aggressive disease (Supplementary Table 8), and only rs62113212 at chromosome 19q13.33 was nominally associated with non-aggressive disease (P=0.04).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	However, the direction of the effects for African Americans for the SNPs at 3q26.31 and 19q13.33 were consistent with what we observed among Europeans
