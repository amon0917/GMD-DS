0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Breast cancer incidence varies substantially across racial and ethnic groups in the United States.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	The age-adjusted incidence of breast cancer in US European Americans and African Americans is 133.4 and 121.4 (per 100,000), respectively, whereas US women of Latin American origin have an incidence of 90.8 (ref.).
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Among Latina women, those with a high proportion of Indigenous American ancestry are at a lower risk of developing breast cancer.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	This association could result from the correlation between genetic ancestry and environmental risk factors, as well as genetics.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	We have previously used admixture mapping for breast cancer in Latinas and identified 6q25 as a locus at which ancestry is associated with breast cancer.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Indigenous American ancestry at 6q25 is associated with protection from breast cancer, suggesting the association with global ancestry, could, at least in part, be because of genetic variants at that locus
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Since 2007, breast cancer genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified ~80 loci with small to moderate effects on risk (odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 1.05 go 1.53), with the vast majority of these studies limited to women of European ancestry, although GWAS has also been applied to populations of Asian and African ancestry.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	GWAS of breast cancer in Latinas have not yet been published and may lead to the discovery of new disease-associated variants and to improved understanding of the genetic basis for health disparities, as recently demonstrated for type 2 diabetes.

0	breast cancer	NA	NA	RESULTS	For further validation, we tested the association of the rs140068132/rs147157845 SNPs with breast cancer risk in a sample of 546 Colombian women with breast cancer and 440 Colombian women without breast cancer, which also showed a strong association, and in Latinas from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) SHARe Study (120 cases and 3,373 controls), which replicated both the magnitude and direction of the associations (Table 1)
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The rs140068132/rs147157845 SNPs are relatively common in Latin American populations (5% in Puerto Ricans, 10% in Colombians and 14% in Mexicans from the 1KGP) but are absent in Europeans and Africans, and they have a very low frequency in East Asians (Supplementary Table 2).

0	breast cancer	NA	NA	RESULTS	In a previous admixture-mapping analysis that included a subset of these samples, higher Indigenous American ancestry within the 6q25 locus was associated with lower risk of breast cancer.
0	NA	NA	rs140068132	RESULTS	Since the minor alleles of rs140068132 and rs147157845 are protective and are only common in Latinos, we reasoned that they are likely common in Latinos because of Indigenous American ancestry.
0	NA	NA	rs140068132	RESULTS	We checked the allele frequency of rs140068132 in women for whom the locus-specific ancestry at 6q25 was estimated to be homozygous Indigenous American and found the allele frequency to be 25% among controls.

0	breast cancer	FOXA1	rs140068132	RESULTS	Rs140068132 falls within the sequence of several transcription factor-binding sites (TFBS) in ENCODE data including FOXA1, p300, CTCF, HA-E2F1, GATA3 and FOXA2, most of which have been implicated in ER function and/or breast cancer (Supplementary Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	3).
0	NA	NA	rs140068132	RESULTS	Furthermore, MAPPER predicted the SNP to be critical to at least four putative TFBS, three of which were disrupted with the G versus A allele at rs140068132.
0	NA	NA	C for 48	RESULTS	To test functional relevance, two 25-mer biotinylated probes of identical sequence except for the A/G alleles at position chr6:151954834 were synthesized (IDT DNA, chr6:151954823-151954847).

0	breast cancer	ER	NA	DISCUSS	We performed a GWAS for breast cancer in Latinas and identified an association between two linked variants within the 6q25 region, 5' of the ESR1 gene and breast cancer risk.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The minor allele is protective: the odds of having breast cancer decrease by a factor of 0.60 per allele.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We also found that the minor allele is more protective against ER-negative disease and that it is associated with decreased mammographic density.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The rs140068132/rs147157845 SNPs are relatively common in Latin American populations, ranging between 5 and 15% depending on the proportion of Indigenous American ancestry of the region but are rare (<2%) or absent in other groups.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	These variants were not in LD with the index variants reported in Asians and Europeans, which suggests that the newly discovered SNPs represent a novel signal that is specific to populations with Indigenous American ancestry
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Previous studies have reported some risk variants at 6q25 to be more strongly associated with ER-negative disease.
0	NA	NA	rs140068132	DISCUSS	Our findings also showed different association effect sizes by ER status, with the rare variant at rs140068132 being more protective for ER-negative disease.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Further work will be necessary to understand the biological mechanism behind this difference
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We have previously conducted a breast cancer admixture-mapping analysis, which showed that higher Indigenous American ancestry within the 6q25 locus was associated with lower risk of breast cancer.
0	NA	NA	rs140068132	DISCUSS	Adjusting for rs140068132 reduced the magnitude of the association with local ancestry but did not eliminate it completely.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The residual locus-specific ancestry association suggests that there may be additional rare ancestry-informative variants associated with breast cancer at this locus that the present study might not have detected
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	High mammographic density is one of the strongest risk factors for breast cancer.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Some of the SNPs associated with breast cancer risk have also been associated with breast density, which suggests that breast density may mediate genetic associations.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We showed that the rs140068132-protective variant was associated with lower mammographic density and after adjusting for mammographic breast density, the magnitude of the log OR for the rs140068132 polymorphism on breast cancer risk was partially reduced.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This suggests that the SNP might affect breast cancer risk both through and independently of its effect on breast density
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We used both sequencing and in vitro assays (EMSA) to help fine map and assess functionality.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The sequence data did not identify any novel SNP in the region that could explain the association.
0	NA	NA	rs140068132	DISCUSS	Given that the rs140068132 SNP is located within the binding site of multiple transcription factors, we conducted EMSA assays to evaluate whether the two alleles at this position had differential binding affinity to nuclear protein.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Results clearly showed that the protective G allele had a reduced binding affinity to nuclear protein compared with the A allele.
0	breast cancer	NA	C for 48	DISCUSS	While our work suggests that the A/G SNP at rs140068132 has functional relevance, further work will be necessary to understand the exact mechanism by which rs140068132 confers decreased breast cancer risk
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In summary, in this GWAS of breast cancer in Latinas we report a risk variant at the 6q25 locus that, to our knowledge, represents the strongest association effect size on breast cancer for a common variant reported to date.
0	breast cancer	NA	rs140068132	DISCUSS	The rs140068132 variant is limited to populations of Indigenous American ancestry, explained at least part of the previously reported association between breast cancer risk and genetic ancestry at the 6q25 locus in Latinas and may partially account for the lower incidence of breast cancer in this population.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Overall, our findings highlight the importance of conducting genetic studies in non-European ancestry populations.
