0	lung cancer	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	We conducted imputation to the 1000 Genomes Project of four genome-wide association studies of lung cancer in populations of European ancestry (11,348 cases and 15,861 controls) and genotyped an additional 10,246 cases and 38,295 controls for follow-up.
0	lung cancer	NA	K3326X	ABSTRACT	We identified large-effect genome-wide associations for squamous lung cancer with the rare variants of BRCA2-K3326X (rs11571833; odds ratio [OR]=2.47, P=4.74x10-20) and of CHEK2-I157T (rs17879961; OR=0.38 P=1.27x10-13).
1	lung adenocarcinomas	TP63	rs13314271	ABSTRACT	We also showed an association between common variation at 3q28 (TP63; rs13314271; OR=1.13, P=7.22x10-10) and lung adenocarcinoma previously only reported in Asians.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	These findings provide further evidence for inherited genetic susceptibility to lung cancer and its biological basis.

0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Lung cancer causes over 1 million deaths each year worldwide.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	While primarily caused by tobacco smoking, studies have also implicated inherited genetic factors in its etiology; notably genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in Europeans have consistently identified polymorphic variation at 15q25.1 (CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4), 5p15.33 (TERT-CLPTM1) and 6p21.33 (BAT3-MSH5) as determinants of lung cancer risk.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Additionally, susceptibility loci for lung cancer at 3q28, 6q22.2, 13q12.12, 10q25.2 and 22q12.2 in Asians have been identified through GWAS
0	NSCLC	NA	NA	INTRO	Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the commonest lung cancer histology, comprised primarily of adenocarcinoma (AD) and squamous cell carcinoma (SQ).
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	These lung cancer histologies have different molecular characteristics reflective of differences in etiology and carcinogenesis.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Perhaps not surprisingly there is variability in genetic effects on lung cancer risk by histology with subtype-specific associations at 5p15.33 (TERT-CLPTM1) for AD and at 9p21 (CDKN2A/CDKN2B) and 12q13.33 (RAD52) for SQ.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	In addition the 6p21.33 associations are stronger for SQ than AD
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	To identify additional lung cancer susceptibility loci we conducted a meta-analysis of four lung cancer GWAS in populations of European ancestry, the MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) GWAS; the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) GWAS; the National Cancer Institute (NCI) GWAS and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) GWAS (Online Methods) that were genotyped using either Illumina HumanHap 317, 317+240S, 370Duo, 550, 610 or 1M arrays (Supplementary Table 1).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	After filtering the studies provided genotypes on 11,348 cases and 15,861 controls (Supplementary Table 1).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Prior to undertaking meta-analysis of the GWAS, we searched for potential errors and biases in the datasets.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots of genomewide association test statistics showed minimal inflation rendering substantial cryptic population substructure or differential genotype calling between cases and controls unlikely (lambda=1.01 to 1.05; Supplementary Figure 1).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	To bring genotype data obtained from different arrays into a common platform and recover untyped genotypes, we imputed >10 million SNPs using 1000 Genomes Project data as reference.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Q-Q plots for all SNPs and restricted to rare SNPs (minor allele frequency (MAF) <1%) post imputation did not show evidence of substantive over-dispersion introduced by imputation (lambda=0.99-1.06 and 0.82-1.05 respectively; Supplementary Figure 1)
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Pooling data from each GWAS, we derived joint odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) under a fixed effects model for each SNP and associated per allele P-values.
0	cancers	NA	NA	INTRO	To explore the variability in associations according to tumour histology we derived ORs for all lung cancer, AD and SQ
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Meta-analysis identified 50 SNPs that showed evidence of an association with either lung cancer, AD or SQ (P<5.0x10-6; Figure 1) at loci not previously reported in Europeans (Figure 1).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	1Mb regions encompassing these 50 SNPs were evaluated for association through in silico replication in the Harvard and deCODE series.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Nine of the SNPs within these 50 regions showed support for an association (combined P-value <5.0x10-7).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Genotyping of these nine SNPs was attempted in four additional series, Heidelberg-EPIC replication, ICR replication, IARC replication and Toronto replication (Supplementary Table 3 (b), Online Methods).
0	NA	NA	rs185577307	INTRO	rs185577307 could not be genotyped due to repetitive sequence.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Collectively genotypes are available from 21,594 cases and 54,156 controls, providing 80% power to detect a variant with MAF of 0.01 conferring a relative risk of >=1.5.
1	NA	NA	K3326X	INTRO	In the combined analysis of all GWAS plus replication series, SNPs mapping to 13q13.1 (rs11571833, rs56084662), 22q12.1 (rs17879961) and 3q28 (rs13314271) showed evidence for an association, which was statistically significant after adjustment for multiple testing (i.e.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	P<3.0x10-9; Figure 2, Supplementary Table 2).
1	NA	NA	K3326X	INTRO	We confirmed the high fidelity of imputation by genotyping rs11571833, rs17879961 and rs13314271 in subsets of ICR-GWAS, IARC-GWAS, NCI-GWAS and MDACC-GWAS (Supplementary Table 3, Online Methods).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The NCI-GWAS comprised samples from Finland, Italy and the US.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The IARC-GWAS comprised samples from 10 series from Western and Eastern Europe, and the US.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	While adjustment of test statistics for principle components generated on common SNPs had been applied to these GWAS, confounding of rare variants in spatially structured populations is not necessarily corrected by such methods.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We therefore investigated if country of origin had an impact on the associations at 13q13.1 and 22q12.1; the associations remained statistically highly significant (Supplementary Table 4)
0	NA	BRCA2	K3326X	INTRO	Both rs11571833 and rs56084662 localizing to 13q13.1, near or within BRCA2, are rare SNPs (MAF<0.01), map 103kb apart (32,972,376bps, 32,869,614bps) and are moderately correlated (r2=0.45, D'=0.82, based on genotypes from Heidelberg-EPIC, IARC replication, ICR-replication and Toronto-replication series; Figure 3).
0	NA	NA	K3326X	INTRO	rs11571833 (c.9976A>T) is responsible for BRCA2-K3326X whereas rs56084662 is located in the 3'UTR of FRY.
0	NA	NA	K3326X	INTRO	While the association provided by rs11571833 was substantially stronger than rs56084662 in the combined analysis (OR=1.83, P=2.11x10-19 and P=1.88x10-15) conditional analysis based on directly genotyped samples in the replication series was consistent with the two SNPs tagging the same haplotype.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	K3326X	INTRO	The rs11571833 association is primarily driven by a relationship with SQ rather than AD histology (OR=2.47, P=4.74x10-20 and OR=1.47, P=4.66x10-4 respectively; Figure 2, Supplementary Table 2).
0	Alzheimer's disease	BRCA2	NA	INTRO	A more significant role for BRCA2 in SQ etiology than in AD is reflected in the higher observed mutational frequency in respective lung cancers (~6% and 1%).
0	breast cancer	NA	K3326X	INTRO	c.9976T has recently been shown to confer a 1.26-fold increased breast cancer risk and previously suggested as a risk factor for esophageal and pancreatic cancers.
0	lung cancer	NA	K3326X	INTRO	We found no evidence for an association between c.9976T and lung cancer risk in non-smokers using directly genotyped samples (Supplementary Table 3), however these cases comprised <10% of each cohort hence our power to demonstrate a relationship was limited.
0	lung cancer	BRCA2	NA	INTRO	Previous analysis of families carrying highly penetrant BRCA2 mutations have either found no evidence for any excess or a reduced lung cancer risk in carriers.
0	Colon and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	A possible explanation for these observations is that members of studied breast-ovarian cancer families tend to smoke less than the general population
0	cancers	NA	NA	INTRO	The rad51-brca2 interaction is pivotal for brca2-mediated double stranded break repair (DSBR) and exon 27 of BRCA2 encodes one of the highly conserved rad51 binding domains; homozygous deletion of exon 27 in mice confers susceptibility to tumours including lung cancer.
0	NA	brca2	K3326X	INTRO	c.9976T leads to the loss of the C-terminal domain of brca2 inviting speculation that the SNP is functional.
1	NA	RAD51	T3387A	INTRO	While the deleted region is distal to the rad51 binding domain and an impact on nuclear localisation is debated the nearby mutation at BRCA2 T3387A interrupts chk2-phosphorylation and abrogates BRCA2-Chk2-Rad51 mediated recombination repair.
0	NA	BRCA2	NA	INTRO	Alternatively, the association might be a consequence of linkage disequilibrium (LD) with another BRCA2 mutation.
0	breast cancer	BRCA2	c.6275delTT	INTRO	Studies of breast cancer families with northern European ancestry show the BRCA2 c.6275delTT and c.4889C>G mutations which are highly penetrant for breast and ovarian cancer originated on a K3326X haplotype.
0	lung cancer	NA	K3326X	INTRO	To gain further insight into a probable genetic basis of the 13q13.1 lung cancer association we sequenced germline DNA from 70 lung cancer cases which carried c.9976A>T from the UK Genetic Lung Cancer Predisposition Study for c.6275delTT and c.4889C>G mutations.
0	NA	NA	c.6275delTT	INTRO	In none were c.6275delTT and c.4889C>G mutations identified.
0	lung cancer	BRCA2	K3326X	INTRO	Similarly sequencing the coding region of BRCA2 identified no clearly pathogenic mutations amongst 13 individuals from 1958BC, 11 IARC lung cancer cases or 24 TCGA lung cancer cases carrying c.9976T.
0	Colon and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer	BRCA2	K3326X	INTRO	In Iceland c.9976T is not correlated with the founder BRCA2 mutation p.256_257del (999del5) which greatly increases breast and ovarian cancer risk.
0	lung cancer	NA	K3326X	INTRO	Paradoxically while c.9976T is a risk factor for lung cancer in this population the SNP is not associated with breast or ovarian cancer risk cancer (Supplementary Table 5).
0	lung cancer	NA	K3326X	INTRO	Although in vitro studies have failed to demonstrate K3326X affects DNA repair our findings raise the possibility K3326X may have a direct effect on lung cancer risk.
0	lung cancer	BRCA2	K3326X	INTRO	Since somatic mutation of BRCA2 is not associated with K3326X carrier status  (Supplementary Table 6 (a)) it suggests that any impact the SNP has on lung cancer risk is mediated through alternative mechanisms
0	NA	NA	rs17879961	INTRO	The relationship at 22q12.1 between the SNP rs17879961 (c.470T>C) and SQ in the combined series (OR=0.38, P=1.27x10-13) validates an association previously reported (Figure 2, Supplementary Table 2, Supplementary Table 4).
0	NA	NA	rs17879961	INTRO	The frequency of rs17879961 varies significantly between populations with the MAF being ~5% in Eastern Europeans (e.g.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	IARC series) but almost monomorphic in most Northern Europeans.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	This is likely to account for a failure to demonstrate a significant relationship in the ICR, MDACC, Toronto and deCODE series which comprise largely Western European populations (Figure 2, Supplementary Table 2).
1	arrest	CHEK2	rs17879961	INTRO	rs17879961 is responsible for the I157T missense mutation in CHEK2, a cell cycle control gene encoding a pluripotent kinase that can cause arrest or apoptosis in response to DNA damage.
1	lung cancer	CHEK2	NA	INTRO	Acquired mutation of CHEK2 is rarely seen in lung cancer and CHEK2-I57T genotype does not appear to correlate with mutation (Supplementary Table 6 (a)) raising the possibility that carrier status per se influences cancer risk.
1	NA	CHEK2	rs17879961	INTRO	I157T lies in a functionally important domain of chek2 causing reduced or abolished binding of principal substrates.
0	breast cancer	NA	rs17879961	INTRO	While c.470C increases breast cancer risk here c.470C was associated with reduced lung cancer risk.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	A mechanism for the paradoxical associations is not immediately apparent.
1	NA	CHEK2	NA	INTRO	CHEK2 can however have opposite effects on damaged stem cells retarding stem cell division until DNA damage is repaired, or activating apoptosis if damage cannot be repaired.
1	squamous disease	CHEK2	I151T	INTRO	Although speculative, in the presence of continued DNA damage to squamous epithelia by tobacco smoke the normal stem cell defences involving chek2 might be attenuated by a reduction in chek2 activity as a result of I151T.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Concordant with such a model is that a paradoxically increased lung cancer risk was seen in non-smokers (P=0.05), and correlated subgroups of AD and women, albeit based on small numbers (Supplementary Table 3)
1	lung cancer	NA	rs13314271	INTRO	The association between variation at 3q28 marked by rs13314271 and lung cancer risk was restricted to AD (OR=1.13, P=7.22x10-10Figure 2, Supplementary Table 2).
1	NA	TP63	rs13314271	INTRO	rs13314271 maps within intron 1 of TP63 (Figure 3).
1	Alzheimer's disease	TP63	rs4488809	INTRO	Variation at TP63 defined by the intron 1 SNP rs4488809, which is in complete LD with rs13314271 (r2=1.00, D'=1.00) is associated with AD in Asians.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Our findings provide robust evidence for the generalisability of a relationship between 3q28 variation and AD.
1	lung cancer	NA	rs13314271	INTRO	A weak association between rs13314271 and lung cancer risk was shown in non-smokers (P=0.03; Supplementary Table 3 (b)).
1	cancers	TP63	NA	INTRO	TP63 is a member of the tumor suppressor TP53 gene family, which is pivotal to cellular differentiation and responsiveness to cellular stress.
1	NA	TP63	NA	INTRO	Exposure of cells to DNA damage leads to induction of TP63 and both isoforms have the ability to transactivate TP53 target genes, hence impacting on cellular responsiveness to DNA damage.
1	NA	NA	rs13314271	INTRO	While rs13314271 does not map to an evolutionary conserved region (ECR), rs7636839 which is correlated with rs13314271 and rs4488809 (r2=1.0) maps to an ECR and has predicted enhancer activity (Supplementary Table 6 (b)).
1	NA	TP63	rs4488809	INTRO	Moreover, rs4488809 has been shown to be an eQTL for p63 in lung tissue.
1	Alzheimer's disease	TP63	NA	INTRO	Although the mechanism by which 3q28 variation affects AD development is unknown, accumulation of DNA damage and lack of response to genotoxic stress is recognized to contribute to lung carcinogenesis; hence loss of fidelity of repair as a consequence of differential TP63 expression is likely to be deleterious
1	lung cancer	NA	K3326X	INTRO	There was no association between rs11571833, rs17879961 and rs13314271 genotypes and cigarette consumption using smoking information on 43,693 Icelandic subjects (Supplementary Table 7); in contrast to the 15q25 association and risk of lung cancer
1	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	While there is overlap distinct DNA lesions are ostensibly repaired by different DNA repair pathways and the histology specific relationships seen implicate the brca2-chek2-rad52 DSBR-homologous recombination pathways as a determinant of SQ and defective tp53/tert apoptosis-telomerase regulation as a basis of AD risk
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	In conclusion, our findings provide further evidence for inherited genetic susceptibility to lung cancer and underscore the importance of searching for histology-specific risk variants.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Our data also provide an important proof of principle that 1000 Genomes imputation can be used to detect novel, low frequency-large effect associations, thereby extending the utility of pre-existing GWAS data.
0	lung cancer	BRCA2	K3326X	INTRO	Notably this has facilated the identification of BRCA2 c.9976T which represents by far the stongest genetic association in lung cancer reported so far.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	For a smoker carrying this variant (2% of the population) the risk of developing lung cancer is approximately doubled, which may have implications for identifying high risk ever-smoking subjects for lung cancer screening.
0	lung cancer	PARP	K3326X	INTRO	Additionally, study of the effect of PARP inhibition for smokers with lung cancer carrying BRCA2 c.9976T may be warranted
