0	male breast cancer	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	The etiology of male breast cancer (MBC) is poorly understood.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	In particular, the extent to which the genetic basis of MBC differs from female breast cancer (FBC) is unknown.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	A previous genome-wide association study of MBC identified 2 predisposition loci for the disease, both of which were also associated with risk of FBC
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	We performed genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping of European ancestry MBC case subjects and controls in 3 stages.

0	breast cancer	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Men in the top quintile of genetic risk had a fourfold increased risk of breast cancer relative to those in the bottom quintile (odds ratio = 3.86, 95% confidence interval = 3.07 to 4.87, P = 2.08 x 10-30)
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	These findings advance our understanding of the genetic basis of MBC, providing support for an overlapping genetic etiology with FBC and identifying a fourfold high-risk group of susceptible men
0	male breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Male breast cancer (MBC) is rare, accounting for less than 1% of all breast cancer diagnoses.
0	breast cancer	ER	NA	INTRO	A greater proportion of MBCs than female breast cancers (FBCs) are of the estrogen receptor (ER)-positive subtype (>95% MBC vs 75% FBC), suggesting that MBC may comprise a more homogeneous group of tumors than FBC.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Although there is a paucity of data regarding the etiology of MBC, family history and genetic susceptibility are important risk factors.
0	NA	BRCA2	NA	INTRO	Approximately 10% of cases are attributable to inherited mutations in BRCA2.
0	breast cancer	BRCA1	NA	INTRO	Conversely, mutations in BRCA1 are observed in only a small number of cases, suggesting differences in the underlying genetic etiologies of MBC and FBC
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Common germline variants influence susceptibility to MBC.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Our previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) of MBC identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at 14q24.1 and 16q12.1 that were associated with susceptibility at genome-wide levels of statistical significance.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	Moreover, although these loci were also associated with FBC susceptibility, they conferred greater risks of breast cancer in men than women (14q24.1 odds ratio [OR] = 1.57 vs 1.07 and 16q12.1 OR = 1.50 vs 1.22 for MBC and FBC, respectively), lending weight to findings from population-based family history studies that suggest a greater contribution of genetic variation to MBC than FBC predisposition
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	INTRO	In this study, we pooled individual-level data from our GWAS with 2 additional case-control datasets to identify novel MBC risk variants, to illuminate better the genetic basis of MBC and to enable comparisons between determinants of polygenic predisposition to MBC and FBC

0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	There was no evidence of breast-specific eQTL associations with target genes at the other loci, which could reflect limited power to detect subtle differences in gene expression
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We have performed the largest genetic association study of MBC to date by conducting, as is usual in GWAS, genome-wide imputation and meta-analysis of existing and newly generated genotyping data.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We identified 3 novel MBC predisposition loci that attained genome-wide levels of statistical significance, of which 2 mapped to 6q25.1 and 1 mapped to 11q13.3, bringing the total number of confirmed predisposition loci to 5.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Notably, each of these loci is also associated with risk of FBC, and almost 20% of confirmed FBC susceptibility SNPs showed evidence of association with MBC predisposition.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	To date, no low-penetrance alleles have been identified that are exclusively associated with MBC but not FBC.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Although our study does not rule out the possibility that such loci exist, it does suggest that the magnitudes of their effects will be small.
0	breast cancer	BRCA1	NA	DISCUSS	Although differences between the frequencies of pathogenic BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations have led to the suggestion that MBC and FBC have distinct genetic etiologies, our genetic correlation analysis provides evidence of a shared genetic basis for MBC and ER-positive FBC.
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Interestingly, we detected borderline evidence (P = .06) of a cross-cancer genetic correlation between MBC and ovarian cancer, consistent with a recently reported genetic correlation between FBC and ovarian cancer
0	breast cancer	BRCA1	NA	DISCUSS	Lecarpentier et al., recently demonstrated that a FBC PRS is associated with breast cancer risk in male BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We show here for the first time, to our knowledge, that a FBC PRS is associated with MBC risk in men from the general population.
0	NA	BRCA1	NA	DISCUSS	The odds ratio per SD increase in the PRS for males is almost identical to that of unselected females and is greater than that of male BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Although risk stratification among the general population using a PRS is unfeasible given both the rarity of MBC and level of risk differentiation, the striking similarity between the PRS distributions of MBC and FBC cases suggests that a larger number of FBC predisposition variants than were detected by our study probably influence susceptibility to MBC
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Although our genetic correlation analysis indicated that MBC shares a pronounced genetic basis with ER-positive FBC, there are distinctions.
0	breast cancer	NA	rs9371545	DISCUSS	For example, we observed several MBC associations among SNPs that confer greater risks of ER-negative than ER-positive FBC, including SNP rs9371545 at 6q25.1 and the BRCA2 truncating variant rs11571833.
0	breast cancer	NA	rs11249433	DISCUSS	Conversely, several SNPs that are most strongly associated with ER-positive FBC were not associated with MBC, including rs11249433 at 1p11.2, rs34005590 at 2q35, and rs2981578 at 10q26.13.
0	NA	NA	rs2981578	DISCUSS	Although this may be a consequence of power, the ER-positive FBC odds ratio for rs2981578 is large and should be detectable in our study.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We hypothesize that the underlying etiological mechanisms affected by SNPs that had statistically significant differences in their odds ratios for MBC and FBC might be influenced by sex-specific differences in expression or activity of their target genes or by different endogenous factors in males and females.
0	breast cancer	FGFR2	rs2981578	DISCUSS	The comparatively lower expression of FGFR2 in male than female breast tissue, as observed in GTEx data, could explain the lack of an MBC association with rs2981578 at the 10q26.13 locus, despite it being among the most strongly associated SNPs with ER-positive FBC
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The principal limitation of our study was its relatively small size compared with typical cancer GWAS.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Consequently, it had limited capacity to detect MBC predisposition loci that are associated with small risk effects, and much larger studies will be needed for their discovery.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The merits, or otherwise, of continually striving to identify polygenic determinants of disease susceptibility that confer relatively small effects have been debated extensively, particularly because they may have limited clinical usefulness in the short term.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, all statistically robust genetic associations (even those with small effects) are underpinned by risk alleles that perturb biological processes, of which some might harbor effective targets for therapeutic intervention, thus justifying efforts that could lead to their detection.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The subsequent illumination of the target genes and pathways that underlie risk associations in MBC will also likely be difficult, not least because of a paucity of cell line models derived from male breast tumors for functional analysis.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In conclusion, our findings indicate several elements of shared genetic basis for susceptibility to MBC and FBC, provide further support for a polygenic component to MBC susceptibility, and advance our understanding of the genetics of MBC development
