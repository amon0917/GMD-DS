0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Here we present the results of the primary analysis of the SNP vs. OS association in patients of European ancestry (n=294), in both arms combined (Figure 2)
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Of the 20 SNPs that showed the most significant association with OS, nine were in annotated genes, one was near a gene, and ten were in intergenic regions (Table 2).
0	NA	NA	rs763780	RESULTS	All SNPs in genes were intronic, with the exception of the coding SNP rs763780 in IL17F.
0	NA	NA	rs763780	RESULTS	The SNP with the highest statistical significance was rs763780 in IL17F (p 2.61x10-8), with a MAF of 0.04 (Figure 2).
0	NA	NA	rs763780	RESULTS	Patients who were rs763780 heterozygous had reduced median OS of 3.1 months (2.3-4.3) compared to patients without the variant (no patients were homozygous for the variant), who had a median OS of 6.8 months (5.8-7.3, Figure 3A).
0	NA	NA	rs7771466	RESULTS	This SNP was also in strong linkage disequilibrium (r2 0.955) with another IL17F SNP (rs7771466) having the second highest statistical significance (p 1.66x10-7) and a similar effect on OS [3.1 months (2.4-4.3) vs. 6.6 months (5.8-7.2)].
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	A similar trend was observed in the subset of patients of African ancestry (Supplemental Material, Figure 3).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The associations between the SNPs in IL17F and OS, after adjusting for the stratification factors, treatment arm, and genetic ancestry within Europeans, do not meet the criterion for genome-wide statistical significance (1x10-7) (Supplemental Material, Table 1)
0	NA	NA	rs7771466	RESULTS	In silico analysis of the putative function of the intronic IL17F rs7771466 variant (in very strong LD with the non-synonymous rs763780) indicates that a) rs7771466 introduces an additional CDX1 transcription factor binding site to one present in the wild-type sequence, and b) rs763780 abolishes an exonic splicing silencer and introduces two exonic splicing enhancers (Supplementary Material, Table 2)

0	pancreatic cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This preliminary study generates hypotheses on the role of the IL17F gene in the biology of advanced pancreatic cancer.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	If replicated, the IL17F SNPs might have prognostic significance
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	IL17F encodes interleukin-17F, a cytokine with the ability to induce stromal cells to secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines.
0	NA	NA	rs763780	DISCUSS	The most significant SNP in this study is rs763780 in IL17F, a base substitution that alters the histidine to arginine at amino acid 161 (H161R).
0	NA	NA	C for 48	DISCUSS	In vitro functional experiments demonstrated that, in contrast to the wild-type 161H interleukin-17F, the 161R variant form lacks the ability to activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, thereby restricting cytokine and chemokine production.
0	NA	NA	C for 48	DISCUSS	Wild-type 161H interleukin-17F has also demonstrated a strong anti-angiogenesis effect by markedly inhibiting the angiogenesis of human endothelial cells and inducing them to produce interleukin-2, TGF-beta, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	A recent study has also shown the anti-angiogenetic and anti-tumor properties of wild-type interleukin-17F in vivo.
0	NA	NA	C for 48	DISCUSS	With respect to these activities, the variant 161R form of interleukin-17F is a natural antagonist of the anti-angiogenic and pro-inflammatory effects of wild-type 161H interleukin-17F.
0	NA	NA	C for 48	DISCUSS	For example, the 161R variant has been associated with protective effects in Asian patients with inflammatory and autoimmune conditions.
0	NA	NA	C for 48	DISCUSS	The resulting pro-angiogenic effects of the variant 161R of interleukin-17F could be further magnified by the concomitant increased expression driven by the noncoding rs7771466 IL17F variant.
0	NA	NA	rs763780	DISCUSS	This variant is almost in complete linkage disequilibrium with the nonsynonymous rs763780, and its minor allele seems to increase interleukin-17F expression through splicing enhancement and introduction of an additional CDX1 transcription factor binding site.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The putative synergistic effect of these IL17F variants should be verified in experimental models of SNP functionality and angiogenesis
0	pancreatic cancer	NA	C for 48	DISCUSS	As angiogenesis has been thought to play an important role in the growth and metastatic spread of pancreatic cancer, we hypothesize that the angiogenesis potential of tumors of patients with the variant 161R interleukin-17F is higher than tumors with wild-type 161H interleukin-17F, conferring worse prognosis.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, other mechanisms related to the pro-inflammatory effects of interleukin-17F cannot be excluded
0	NA	NA	rs763780	DISCUSS	The IL17F rs763780 is the most important candidate SNP discovered by this study, due to 1) the genome-wide significance, 2) its already established molecular function, 3) the mechanistic hypothesis explaining the association with reduced OS, and 4) the suggestion that a trend could be detected in patients of African ancestry, despite the very small sample size.
0	pancreatic cancer	NA	rs763780	DISCUSS	This study proposes that rs763780 in IL17F might have a prognostic effect in advanced pancreatic cancer patients, also because stratification by treatment arm does not seem to negatively affect the association (Supplemental Material, Table 1).
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Because gemcitabine is given in both arms, a true interaction between gemcitabine and IL17F SNPs cannot be tested.
0	NA	NA	rs763780	DISCUSS	Additionally, a review of the clinical characteristics of the patients heterozygous for IL17F rs763780 did not show any obvious difference with respect to the characteristics of the overall population accrued into this study (data not shown)
0	pancreatic cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In addition to IL17F, this study proposes additional genes as putatively involved in determining differences in survival among patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.
0	NA	NA	rs11644322	DISCUSS	Among the SNPs listed in Table 2, rs11644322 in WWOX demonstrated a gene-dosage effect, with median OS in the heterozygous patients (5.3 months, 4.3-6.9) that was intermediate between the other two genotype groups (3.3 months, 2.9-5.7, for the variant homozygotes; 7.1 months, 6.0-8.4, for the wild-type homozygotes; p 1.31x10-5; Figure 3B).

0	multiple myeloma	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In multiple myeloma, loss of heterozygosity of 16q23, the location of WWOX, was associated with adverse survival and reduced WWOX expression.
0	lung cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Germline variants from a recent study mapped WWOX as one of the genes associated with clinical staging in lung cancer.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Contrary to the amino acid changing SNP in IL17F, the molecular functions of the SNPs in WWOX are not known at this time.
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Due to their association with reduced OS, the established tumor suppressor role of WWOX, and their intronic location, we hypothesize that these SNPs might reduce the expression of WWOX, diminishing its tumor suppressor properties, and leading to worse prognosis
0	NA	NA	rs10883617	DISCUSS	A SNP (rs10883617) near BTRC was associated with reduced OS, as homozygote patients had a reduced median OS (3.6 months, 2.7-6.8) compared to heterozygous patients (6.1 months, 4.9-7.3) and patients who were not carriers of this variant (6.9 months, 5.9-8.2; p 3.94x10-5, Figure 3C).
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	BTRC (beta-transducin repeat containing) encodes a protein involved in the ubiquitination processes that demonstrated an oncogenic activity in several cancers including pancreatic cancer.
0	cancers	p<10-5	NA	DISCUSS	In most tumors, overexpression of BTRC results in the degradation of IKappaB, an inhibitor of the NFkappaB transcription factor, and thus the activation of NFkappaB and the uncontrolled cell proliferation in these tumors.
0	NA	NA	rs10883617	DISCUSS	The use of our functional results in lymphoblastoid cell lines treated with gemcitabine indicated that BTRC rs10883617 is associated with increased IC50 and, hence, resistance to gemcitabine (r 0.21, p 0.008).
0	pancreatic cancer	p<10-5	rs10883617	DISCUSS	As inhibiting and silencing NFkappaB have been shown to increase the sensitivity of pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine, we hypothesize that BTRC rs10883617 might have a predictive value in pancreatic cancer patients treated with gemcitabine, via a NFkappaB-mediated effect
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This study is limited by the large number of multiple comparisons typical of GWAS, increasing the chance of false positive associations.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	This limitation could be overcome by independent replication of the findings.
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Replication studies in cancer treatment outcome have intrinsic difficulties, as there may not be an existing trial (to be used for replication) with the same eligibility criteria and drug treatment of the trial used for discovery.
0	pancreatic cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In a relatively uncommon disease like pancreatic cancer, the access to a sufficiently powered replication set is particularly challenging.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Ideally, validation of our top hits should be conducted in patients treated with gemcitabine and randomized to an experimental treatment, in order to ensure that the populations are comparable.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	A few published trials where patient DNA has been already collected may be considered for replication, due to similarity of treatment and/or disease, and randomized treatment.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Additionally, the MAF of the variants in IL17F is low in Caucasians (0.05 from HapMap), potentially limiting the ability to replicate this association in this population.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, the MAF of the variants in IL17F is higher in Asians (0.13)
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The results of this study are preliminary because of the limited sample size and the low MAF of the IL17F SNP.
0	pancreatic cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Due to the refractoriness to treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer and the lack of established markers of survival, the dissemination of these findings to the scientific community could facilitate their replication by others, even as we continue to conduct replication and validation studies.
