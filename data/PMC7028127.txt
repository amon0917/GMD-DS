0	Breast and prostate cancer	PSA	NA	INTRO	Prostate cancer (PrCa) is the most common nonskin cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death among men in the U.S., with large differences in incidence rates observed across ethnic groups.1 Age-adjusted incidence rates (per 100,000) are highest in African Americans (AA; 178.3), lower in non-Hispanic whites (NHW; 105.7), and slightly lower still in Hispanics/Latinos (91.8).1, 2 In the only prospective study of PrCa in Latinos, risk was observed to be higher among Latinos compared to NHW after adjustment for potential confounders, including lifestyle factors and PSA screening history.3 Though classified as a single ethnic group, the Latino population consists of genetically admixed individuals from populations that display considerable diversity in PrCa incidence and mortality rates.
0	cancers	NA	NA	INTRO	For example, analyses of cancer registry data in Florida revealed that Latinos of Mexican origin had a remarkably lower age-adjusted incidence rate of PrCa compared to those of Cuban or Puerto Rican origin or to NHW,4 whereas Latinos with Dominican and Cuban origins had a significantly higher PrCa mortality rate compared to NHW.5 Possible explanations for these differences include variation across subgroups in place of birth, acculturation, socioeconomic status (SES), access to care, lifestyle factors, and genetic ancestry and susceptibility.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Latinos are extensively admixed from multiple ancestries including Amerindian (AMR), European (EUR) and African (AFR),6 with large variation in ancestry proportions observed across subgroups and individuals.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	For example, the proportion of AFR ancestry is small among Mexicans (<10%) but quite large in Dominicans and Puerto Ricans (20-40%).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Throughout the Americas, and even within a single country, AMR ancestry proportions vary widely.6, 7
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	GWAS in non-European populations have provided insight into ancestry-specific variation and have revealed regions of susceptibility that are of particular importance in certain populations.

0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The p values for interaction between PRS and EUR and AMR global ancestry were 0.26 and 0.04, respectively.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	The PRS odds ratios were larger using weights among Latino men from our study; the top 10% PRS stratum had a 4.18-fold (95% CI: 3.47, 5.04) elevated risk and those in the top 1% had a 6.87-fold (95% CI: 4.27, 11.06; Table 1).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Effect modification of the Latino-weighted PRS by EUR and AMR global ancestry was also observed (Table 2 and Supporting Information Table S5), with p values for interaction of 0.08 and 0.01, respectively

0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In our study, among Latinos, two known risk regions, at 8q24.21 and 10q11.22, achieved genome-wide significance, and admixture mapping highlighted the 8q24 region as harboring PrCa risk variants related to local African ancestry.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The majority of established risk alleles were also replicated in Latinos in terms of directional consistency, and among them, ~30% achieved nominal significance.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In the PRS analysis, the established risk alleles were found to be strongly associated with PrCa risk, with a larger PRS effect observed for men with more European ancestry
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Previous GWAS studies of PrCa have identified more than 170 common risk variants, with the majority of discovery populations being of European or Asian ancestry.28, 30 As found in previous studies in men of African ancestry,16 directional consistency was also observed for the majority (>80%) of risk variants in Latinos, among which ~30% were nominally statistically significant, suggesting that most of the known genetic susceptibility loci for PrCa generalize to the Latino population, which may not be surprising given their high degree of European ancestry.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Two regions, 8q24 and 10q11.22, achieved genome-wide significance.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The risk region at 8q24 harbors multiple independent risk variants and is consistently recognized as the most significant PrCa risk region across ethnic populations.16, 31 However, in the Latino population, the 10q11.22 surpassed 8q24 as the most significant risk region.
1	NA	NA	rs10993994	DISCUSS	At 10q11.22, the risk variant rs10993994 has been consistently associated with PrCa risk across populations,32, 33, 34 and is likely to be the putative causal variant within the region.35 The risk allele rs10993994-T is more common among populations of African ancestry (RAFAFR = 0.65, RAFAMR = 0.40, RAFEUR = 0.39) in Phase III 1KGP.
1	NA	MSMB	rs10993994	DISCUSS	In our Latino men, it was associated with a 1.29-fold (95%CI: 1.19, 1.39) increased risk, which is similar to that reported in the largest European PrCa GWAS (OR = 1.23, 1.21, 1.25),28 while larger than that reported in the AA PrCa GWAS (OR = 1.12, 95%CI: 1.07, 1.16).16 This allele is located close to the transcription start site of the microseminoprotein-beta (MSMB) gene and was reported to be significantly related with gene expression abundance.36 The encoded microseminoprotein (MSP) is one of the three major proteins secreted by the prostate, and we have shown that reduced serum levels are strongly associated with PrCa risk.37 In comparison to whites and blacks, the geometric mean plasma MSP level was observed to be lower in PrCa-free Latinos after adjusting for rs10993994 genotype, age, BMI and PSA level.38 However, in contrast to the association observed with the risk SNP, the magnitude of the association between blood MSP concentration and PrCa risk is smaller in Latinos than whites, yet the difference was not statistically significant.37 Additional studies will be needed to better understand the strong association between the 10q11.22 risk SNP and PrCa risk in Latinos
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Latinos are a highly heterogeneous population; the ancestry structure varies widely across subgroups.
0	death	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Previous literature reported that compared to other Latino subgroups, Mexicans had the highest proportion of Native American ancestries.39 Coincidently, studies have also shown that self-reported Mexican Americans have lower PrCa incidence and mortality rates than whites and other Latino-subgroups,4, 40, 41 suggesting that AmerIndian genetic ancestry might be a protective factor for PrCa risk.
0	breast cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	A previous study showed that the estimated global AMR ancestry was inversely associated with breast cancer risk.42 Similarly, our results support the hypothesis that global AMR ancestry was inversely associated with PrCa risk, even after excluding the outlier study MDA with Mexican American controls but a more diverse representation of Latino cases.
0	cancers	NA	NA	DISCUSS	To note, global genetic ancestry estimates not only reflect potential genetic differences in disease susceptibility but may also capture cultural, behavioral and lifestyle factors, including SES as well as access and adherence to medical care and cancer screening.
0	chronic disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	For some chronic diseases, associations between genetic ancestry and disease risk have been shown to be greatly attenuated or extinguished after accounting for such factors.43 However, this is not the case in some other studies of lung cancer,44 myocardial infarction and impaired fasting glucose.45 Thus, further investigation is required to disentangle genetic ancestry representing genetic vs. nongenetic/social/behavioral influences on PrCa risk
1	NA	NA	rs10993994	DISCUSS	While none of the interactions between known risk alleles and local ancestry were significant after correcting for multiple tests, there was a suggestion that variant rs10993994 was more strongly associated with risk among men with greater local AMR ancestry.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In men with a high or moderate proportion of local AMR ancestry, the OR was 1.4 vs. 1.2 in men with lower local AMR ancestry (<25%), which may explain the observed strong association in 10q11.22 risk region among Latinos.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Testing interaction effects by local ancestry in Latinos will require a larger sample size
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Previous PRS analyses in populations of European ancestry have reported a ~threefold difference in risk comparing people in the top 10% risk stratum to the population average,46, 47, 48, 49 with the magnitude of effect being similar in African Americans.16 Similar to the previously reported effect size in studies among men of European descent, we observed a 3.2-fold increased PrCa risk in Latino men.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	A multiethnic study, which contained a part of our samples, demonstrated that when comparing the highest to the lowest risk score decile, the effect size was larger among non-Hispanic whites than in Latinos (OR = 6.2 vs. 5.8).24 Consistent with their results, we observed a stronger effect of the PRS on PrCa risk among Latino men with higher proportion of European global ancestry: among them, the effect size comparing the top 10% to the population average risk stratum increased to 3.7-fold.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	These observations may be due to ethnic differences in the frequencies of risk alleles and to the LD patterns surrounding causal SNPs and suggest that global ancestry background might modify the effect of PrCa risk variants, further supporting the need to construct ethnicity-specific PRS.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We also found the PRS associations to be larger when using weights from Latino men in our study; however, since weights came from the same population, the effect sizes are likely to be overestimated.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	An independent Latino replication sample is needed to validate this observation
0	NA	MAF	NA	DISCUSS	Although our analysis represented the largest study of PrCa genetic susceptibility among Latinos, it remained underpowered for less common risk alleles with small effect size; for the genome-wide analysis (alpha = 5 x 10-8), our study only had 80% a priori power to detect common risk alleles (MAF = 10%) with moderate effect size (OR >= 1.40); for known risk alleles with MAF of 5%, the power to detect ORs of 1.20 at a nominal significant level (p < 0.05) was only 70%.
0	NA	MAF	NA	DISCUSS	However, for common variants with MAF > 10%, we had more than adequate power (90%) to detect a moderate effect of 1.20
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In summary, we found that the known PrCa risk variants can stratify PCa risk in Latino men.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Larger studies in Latino populations, both in the US and in other countries, which will expand AMR ancestral diversity, will be required to characterize genetic risk variants and improve risk stratification for this population
