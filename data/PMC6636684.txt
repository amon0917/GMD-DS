0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Despite these limitations, we intend to disseminate these discoveries into the public scientific domain, so that other studies could be built on the basis of our data
0	pancreatic cancer	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We are reporting the first comprehensive genomic analysis of gemcitabine-induced neutropenia in pancreatic cancer in patients of European origin.
0	febrile neutropenia	cytidine deaminase	rs2072671	DISCUSS	This study has generated a novel mechanistic hypothesis on the protective effect of the CDA rs2072671 on early high-grade neutropenia that should be tested in other studies of gemcitabine and other pyrimidine analogs inactivated by cytidine deaminase.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	All genotype and phenotype data will be made available in dbGaP, as per NIH guidelines of NIH-sponsored studies and upon permission from the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology.
0	febrile neutropenia	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Because a validation set was not available, reproduction of the signals presented in this study will be key to provide evidence of clinical validity of novel markers of gemcitabine neutropenia
0	NA	NA	NA	FIG	The graph on the right shows the stratification by arm (gemcitabine plus placebo and gemcitabine plus bevacizumab).
0	febrile neutropenia	NA	NA	FIG	The vertical line represents the cut-off for the definition of early neutropenia (5 weeks)

0	NA	NA	NA	FIG	B) K-562.
0	NA	NA	rs2799090	FIG	Results are reported as the mean of 3 individual clones with n=3 experiments, with the exception of rs2799090 which had n=4 experiments in K-562 cells.
0	NA	NA	NA	FIG	The enhancer activity of each SNP was measured in both the forward and reverse orientation.
0	NA	NA	NA	FIG	Error bars represent standard error of the mean (SEM)
0	febrile neutropenia	NA	NA	TABLE	Both unadjusted and adjusted (for prior radiotherapy, log base 10 transformed age, and natural log transformed baseline neutropenia levels) results are shown.
0	NA	NA	NA	TABLE	For the unadjusted results, score test P-values are reported.
0	NA	NA	NA	TABLE	For the adjusted results, Wald test P-values are reported.
