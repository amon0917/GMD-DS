0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	The risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is strongly determined by genetic factors and recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several genes for the disease risk.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	In addition to the disease risk, age-at-onset (AAO) of AD has also strong genetic component with an estimated heritability of 42%.
0	NA	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Identification of AAO genes may help to understand the biological mechanisms that regulate the onset of the disease.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	Here we report the first GWAS focused on identifying genes for the AAO of AD.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	We performed a genome-wide meta analysis on 3 samples comprising a total of 2,222 AD cases.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	ABSTRACT	A total of ~2.5 million directly genotyped or imputed SNPs were analyzed in relation to AAO of AD.
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	ABSTRACT	As expected, the most significant associations were observed in the APOE region on chromosome 19 where several SNPs surpassed the conservative genome-wide significant threshold (P<5E-08).
1	NA	apolipoprotein E	rs1466662	ABSTRACT	The most significant SNP outside the APOE region was located in the DCHS2 gene on chromosome 4q31.3 (rs1466662; P=4.95E-07).
1	Alzheimer's disease	DCHS2	NA	ABSTRACT	There were 19 additional significant SNPs in this region at P<1E-04 and the DCHS2 gene is expressed in the cerebral cortex and thus is a potential candidate for affecting AAO in AD.

0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Alzheimer's disease (AD), a devastating neurodegenerative disease, is the most common form of dementia among the elderly.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Genetically, AD is a complex and multifactorial disease with the possible involvement of multiple genes.
0	NA	beta-amyloid (Abeta)	NA	INTRO	The rare early-onset form of the disease usually follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern and to date three genes have been identified: amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 and 2 (PSEN1, PSEN2).
0	Alzheimer's disease	apolipoprotein E	NA	INTRO	The common late-onset form of the disease is much more complex than the early-onset form and until recently the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene was the only major genetic factor accounting for 20-29% of the risk for late-onset AD.
0	Alzheimer's disease	CR1	NA	INTRO	Recent large genome-wide association studies have identified nine additional genes for late-onset AD, including CR1, BIN1, CLU (a.k.a.
0	NA	CLU	NA	INTRO	APOJ), PICALM, MS4A4/MS4A6E, CD2AP, CD33, EPHA1 and ABCA7.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	There is high heritability for AD risk (up to 80%), but the total risk attributable to all confirmed loci is about 50%, indicating the presence of additional risk genes for late-onset AD
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	In addition to the disease risk, age-at-onset (AAO) of AD is also genetically influenced with an estimated heritability of about 42%.
0	Alzheimer's disease	apolipoprotein E	NA	INTRO	The APOE gene, in addition to affecting the risk of AD, also has a significant impact on AAO of AD and explains about 10% of its variation.
0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	INTRO	Several additional loci with effect sizes similar to or even greater than that of APOE have been suggested.
0	Alzheimer's disease	apolipoprotein E	NA	INTRO	However, some additional genes implicated in AAO of AD have effect sizes far less than the effect of APOE.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	INTRO	Recently a genome-wide association study (GWAS) implicated a locus on chromosome 14 with AAO of AD, but it was not confirmed in a replication study.

1	NA	apolipoprotein E	rs429358	RESULTS	The most significant SNP was rs429358 (E*4) in the APOE gene (P=3.37E-18) followed by rs6857 in TOMM40 (P=4.85E-15) rs4420638 in APOC1 (P=4.14E-14), rs157582 in TOMM40 (P=1.91E-13) and rs2075650 in TOMM40 (P=2.17E-10).

0	NA	apolipoprotein E	NA	RESULTS	Since no other SNPs outside the APOE region were genome-wide significant, we performed a meta analysis by combining the University of Pittsburgh ADRC GWAS data with the Mayo (n=844) and ADNI (n=188) GWAS data.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Figure 3 shows the distribution of AAO in the three samples.

0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The focus of almost all reported GWAS related to AD has been on identifying genes for the disease risk.

0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Here we report the first GWAS focused on identifying genes for the AAO of AD.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	We performed a genome-wide meta analysis on three GWAS data sets comprising a total of 2,222 cases.
1	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Only the APOE/TOMM40/APOC1 region demonstrated genome-wide significant association with AAO, which is due to the previously well established association of the APOE *4 SNP, as this demonstrated the most significant association in the discovery sample

1	Type 2 diabetes	ADAMTS9	rs704454	DISCUSS	The third top SNP on 3p14 (rs704454) is near the ADAMTS9 gene which is expressed in spinal cord and brain along with other tissues and ADAMTS9 is a susceptibility gene for type 2 diabetes.

0	obese	NRXN3	NA	DISCUSS	NRXN3 is expressed in the brain and previous studies have identified this gene to be associated with addiction and obesity.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Previously Bertram et al.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	rs11159647	DISCUSS	reported that a SNP (rs11159647) located at ~84 Mb in this region of 14q13 was associated with AAO of AD.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	However, this SNP did not show significant association in any of our three samples (P=0.335, 0.075, and 0.301 in the ADRC, Mayo and ADNI samples, respectively; P=0.446 in stage 3 meta analysis).
0	Alzheimer's disease	NXPH1	rs6463843	DISCUSS	Other members of the neurexin gene family have been associated with AD, including structural neuroimaging phenotypes in ADNI where NXPH1 (rs6463843) was related to decreased gray matter density on MRI in individuals with the T/T relative to the G/G genotype.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	In particular, AD patients homozygous for the T allele showed differential vulnerability to right hippocampal atrophy as indicated by a SNP x diagnosis interaction
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	The potential significance of the other 4 regions in the present study, not discussed above, is not clear as the 16q24 SNP is not located in a known gene and the known neighboring genes on both sides of this SNP are ~400 kb away.
0	Alzheimer's disease	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Although the other three regions on 18q21, 15q25 and 2q37 have known genes, their role in AD is not clear
0	Alzheimer's disease	apolipoprotein E	NA	DISCUSS	In conclusion, this study has confirmed the established association of the APOE locus with AAO of AD by revealing several genome-wide significant SNPs in this region.
0	NA	NA	NA	DISCUSS	Although we did not identify any non-APOE SNPs meeting a conservative threshold of genome-wide significance, we have identified 11 suggestive loci, many of them harboring potential biological candidate genes that warrant follow-up in additional samples
