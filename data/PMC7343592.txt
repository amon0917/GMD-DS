0	Type 2 diabetes	NA	NA	INTRO	Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), a leading cause of morbidity globally, is projected to affect up to 629 million people by 2045.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	People with T2D are at increased risk of developing a wide range of macro- and microvascular outcomes, and there are large disparities in prevalence, severity and co-morbidities across global populations.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Over 400 common variants have been identified that confer disease susceptibility, yet because most studies have been performed in cohorts of European or Asian ancestry, the impact of these variants across all ethnic needs to be quantified.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Identifying genetic factors and genes underlying T2D-related complications could inform clinical management strategies, including patient stratification or optimizing study design of randomized controlled trials.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	The lack of large, multi-ethnic richly phenotyped cohorts linked to genetic data has made it difficult to address these questions
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We conducted a multi-ethnic association study of T2D risk comprised of 228,499 T2D cases and 1,178,783 controls of European, African American, Hispanic, South Asian, and East Asian ancestry.
0	coronary artery disease	NA	NA	INTRO	We investigated the association of a T2D polygenic risk score with major T2D-related macrovascular outcomes (coronary heart disease (CHD), ischemic stroke, and peripheral artery disease (PAD)) and three microvascular diseases (chronic kidney disease (CKD), retinopathy and neuropathy) in the Million Veteran Program (MVP).
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	Subsequently, we conducted a genome-wide SNP-T2D interaction analysis in MVP to identify genetic variants where the effect of SNP on the vascular outcome depends on the context of T2D presence.
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	We also performed association analyses of genetically predicted expression levels and expression quantitative trait-T2D colocalization analyses to identify the effects of gene-tissue pairs that influence T2D risk through inter-individual variation in expression
0	NA	NA	NA	INTRO	This study complements prior genetic studies of T2D through use of large-scale clinical data in conjunction with polygenic scores, evaluation of context specificity for genetic effects on T2D vascular sequelae, and describing the regulatory circuits that influence T2D risk
0	cancers	NA	NA	RESULTS	We performed a genome-wide, multi-ethnic T2D-association analysis (228,499 cases and 1,178,783 controls) encompassing five ancestral groups (Europeans, African Americans, Hispanics, South Asians and East Asians) by meta-analyzing genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics derived from the Million Veteran Program (MVP) and other studies with non-overlapping participants: DIAMANTE Consortium, Penn Medicine Biobank, Pakistan Genomic Resource, Biobank Japan, Malmo Diet and Cancer Study, Medstar, and PennCath (Methods and Supplementary Tables 1 and 2).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	MVP participants (n = 273,409) comprised predominantly male subjects (91.6%) and were classified as Europeans (72.1%), African Americans (19.5%), Hispanics (7.5%), and Asians (0.9%, Supplementary Table 3)
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We identified 558 independent sentinel SNPs (286 previously unreported, >500 kb and r2 LD < 0.05 from a previous reports; see Methods) associated with T2D (Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	1, Table 1, Supplementary Tables 4-8, and Extended Data Fig.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	1).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Twenty-one additional SNPs were associated at genome-wide significance in ancestry-specific analysis of Europeans only (Supplementary Table 6).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We found that novel loci had smaller magnitudes of effect (average beta regression coefficient of 0.032 +- 0.012 per allele) than previously established SNPs (average beta of 0.054 +- 0.045 per allele, Supplementary Table 5), presumably resulting from enhanced power to discover weaker effects due to the large sample size and ancestral diversity.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Genome-wide chip heritability analysis explained 19% of T2D risk on a liability scale
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	In analysis focused on African American participants (Table 1), we observed a total of 21 loci associated with T2D susceptibility at genome-wide significance, 16 of which were in strong LD with established T2D variants.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Three variants were novel and their effects on T2D appeared specific to African Americans.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Single variant analysis in the Hispanics subset identified two associated SNPs, both of which tagged previously reported T2D loci (Supplementary Table 7).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	No novel associations were observed among the individuals of Asian ancestry (Supplementary Table 8)
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	To evaluate whether the observed genomic inflation is due to the polygenic nature of T2D or due to underlying population stratification, linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) was used in Europeans and Asians to compare lambda genomic control (GC) and LDSC intercept (Methods).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	In Asians, a total of 1,077,427 SNPs were analyzed, resulting in a lambda GC of 1.342 and intercept of 1.094 (se = 0.012).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	In Europeans, 1,198,787 SNPs were analyzed resulting in a lambda GC of 1.863 and intercept of 1.139 (se = 0.016).

0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	For Hispanics, 1,077,427 SNPs were analyzed with lambda GC of 1.093 and intercept of 1.091 (se = 0.113).
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Except perhaps for Hispanics (where the estimated error on the intercept is large), these results suggest that a substantial part of the observed inflation these populations is due to T2D polygenicity
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	In trans-ethnic analysis of the X chromosome, we identified a total of 10 association signals for T2D, of which 7 were novel (Table 2, Supplementary Table 9, and Extended Data Fig.

0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	While at most loci we found no evidence for heterogeneity of effect estimates between Europeans and African Americans, we did observe that 44 (7.9%) variants had significantly different effect size estimates between the two groups (Supplementary Table 10).
0	NA	SLC30A8	NA	RESULTS	Remarkably, four loci near SLC30A8, PTPRQ, GRB10, and COLB showed higher effect sizes for T2D at stronger levels of significance in African Americans compared with Europeans.

0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	To identify coding variants that may drive the association between the lead SNPs and T2D risk, we investigated predicted loss-of-function (pLoF) and missense variants near the identified T2D lead variants from the European-specific T2D summary statistics (Supplementary Table 13).
0	NA	LPL	NA	RESULTS	We identified two pLoF (LPL and ANKDD1B) and 45 missense variants in 47 genes that were in LD with at least one of the T2D lead SNPs (r2 > 0.5, MVP reference panel in Europeans) and were associated at P < 1.0 x 10-4.
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Of the 56 pLoF and missense variants, 14 missense variants were found to be the sentinel T2D SNPs and 19 variants were in LD with novel lead SNPs, and 37 variants were previously reported
0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	We additionally performed a genome-wide screen of all pLoFs and missense variants (not bound by proximity to sentinel T2D lead variants) to enumerate potentially T2D genes not captured by common variant tags (Supplementary Table 14).
0	NA	CCHCR1	NA	RESULTS	We identified one additional pLoF variant in CCHCR1, whereas 37 novel missense variants were associated with T2D at P < 5 x 10-8

0	NA	NA	NA	RESULTS	Genome-wide polygenic risk scores (gPRS) for T2D were calculated in Europeans based on the T2D effect estimates from the previously reported DIAMANTE consortium and then categorized into deciles (Tables 5 and 6).
